The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of specific collagen peptides in 
reducing pain in athletes with functional knee problems during sport. Athletic 
subjects (n = 139) with functional knee pain ingested 5 g of bioactive collagen 
peptides (BCP) or a placebo per day for 12 weeks. The primary outcome of the 
study was a change in pain intensity during activity, which was evaluated by the 
participants and the attending physicians using a visual analogue scale (VAS). 
As secondary endpoints, pain intensity under resting conditions, the range of 
motion of the knee joint, and the use of additional therapeutic options were 
assessed. The results revealed a statistically significant improvement in 
activity-related pain intensity in the verum group compared with placebo. 
(ΔVASBCP = 19.5 ± 2.4; ΔVASPlacebo = 13.9 ± 2.1; p = 0.046). The results were 
confirmed by the physician's assessment. (ΔVASBCP = 16.7 ± 1.8; ΔVASPlacebo = 
12.2 ± 1.8; p = 0.021). Pain under resting conditions was also improved, but no 
significance compared with placebo was detected (ΔVASBCP = 10.2 ± 18.4; 
ΔVASPlacebo = 7.4 ± 15.2; p = 0.209). Due to the high joint mobility at 
baseline, no significant changes of this parameter could be detected. The use of 
additional treatment options was significantly reduced after BCP intake. The 
study demonstrated that the supplementation of specific collagen peptides in 
young adults with functional knee problems led to a statistically significant 
improvement of activity-related joint pain.

IMPORTANCE: Thigh muscle weakness is associated with knee discomfort and 
osteoarthritis disease progression. Little is known about the efficacy of 
high-intensity strength training in patients with knee osteoarthritis or whether 
it may worsen knee symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-intensity strength training reduces knee 
pain and knee joint compressive forces more than low-intensity strength training 
and more than attention control in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial 
conducted at a university research center in North Carolina that included 377 
community-dwelling adults (≥50 years) with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 20 
to 45 and with knee pain and radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Enrollment 
occurred between July 2012 and February 2016, and follow-up was completed 
September 2017.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to high-intensity strength training 
(n = 127), low-intensity strength training (n = 126), or attention control 
(n = 124).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes at the 18-month follow-up were 
Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain (0 
best-20 worst; minimally clinically important difference [MCID, 2]) and knee 
joint compressive force, defined as the maximal tibiofemoral contact force 
exerted along the long axis of the tibia during walking (MCID, unknown).
RESULTS: Among 377 randomized participants (mean age, 65 years; 151 women 
[40%]), 320 (85%) completed the trial. Mean adjusted (sex, baseline BMI, 
baseline outcome values) WOMAC pain scores at the 18-month follow-up were not 
statistically significantly different between the high-intensity group and the 
control group (5.1 vs 4.9; adjusted difference, 0.2; 95% CI, -0.6 to 1.1; 
P = .61) or between the high-intensity and low-intensity groups (5.1 vs 4.4; 
adjusted difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.6; P = .08). Mean knee joint 
compressive forces were not statistically significantly different between the 
high-intensity group and the control group (2453 N vs 2512 N; adjusted 
difference, -58; 95% CI, -282 to 165 N; P = .61), or between the high-intensity 
and low-intensity groups (2453 N vs 2475 N; adjusted difference, -21; 95% CI, 
-235 to 193 N; P = .85). There were 87 nonserious adverse events 
(high-intensity, 53; low-intensity, 30; control, 4) and 13 serious adverse 
events unrelated to the study (high-intensity, 5; low-intensity, 3; control, 5).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with knee osteoarthritis, 
high-intensity strength training compared with low-intensity strength training 
or an attention control did not significantly reduce knee pain or knee joint 
compressive forces at 18 months. The findings do not support the use of 
high-intensity strength training over low-intensity strength training or an 
attention control in adults with knee osteoarthritis.

Objective: Joint-related stress models have been used in the past to induce a 
standardized load on physical structures, allowing researchers to observe 
changes in perceived stress on joints as accurately as possible in healthy 
individuals. Previous studies support the efficacy of UC-II® undenatured type II 
collagen ("undenatured collagen") supplementation in maintaining joint health. 
The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of undenatured collagen on 
knee flexibility in healthy subjects who experience activity-related joint 
discomfort (ArJD). Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo 
(PLA)-controlled study was conducted in healthy subjects with ArJD who had no 
history of osteoarthritis, or joint diseases. Ninety-six (n = 96, 20-55 years 
old) subjects who reported joint discomfort while performing a standardized 
single-leg-step-down test were randomized to receive either PLA (n = 48) or 
40 mg of undenatured collagen (n = 48) supplementation daily for 24 weeks. Range 
of motion (ROM) flexion and extension were measured using a digital goniometer. 
Results: At the end of the study, a statistically significant increase in knee 
ROM flexion was observed in the undenatured collagen group versus the PLA group 
(3.23° vs. 0.21°; p = 0.025). In addition, an increase in knee ROM extension by 
2.21° was observed over time in the undenatured collagen group (p = 0.0061), 
while the PLA group showed a nonsignificant increase by 1.27° (p > 0.05). 
Subgroup analysis by age showed a significant increase in knee ROM flexion in 
subjects >35 years old in the undenatured collagen supplemented group compared 
with PLA (6.79° vs. 0.30°; p = 0.0092). Conclusion: Overall, these results 
suggest that daily supplementation of 40 mg of undenatured collagen improved 
knee joint ROM flexibility and extensibility in healthy subjects with ArJD.

Aging is one of the major risk factors for degenerative joint disorders, 
including those involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). TMJ degeneration 
occurs primarily in the population over 65, significantly increasing the risk of 
joint discomfort, restricted joint mobility, and reduced quality of life. 
Unfortunately, there is currently no effective mechanism-based treatment 
available in the clinic to alleviate TMJ degeneration with aging. We now 
demonstrate that intermittent administration of senolytics, drugs which can 
selectively clear senescent cells, preserved mandibular condylar cartilage 
thickness, improved subchondral bone volume and turnover, and reduced 
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) histopathological score in 
both 23- to 24-month-old male and female mice. Senolytics had little effect on 
4 months old young mice, indicating age-specific benefits. Our study provides 
proof-of-concept evidence that age-related TMJ degeneration can be alleviated by 
pharmaceutical intervention targeting cellular senescence. Since the senolytics 
used in this study have been proven relatively safe in recent human studies, our 
findings may help justify future clinical trials addressing TMJ degeneration in 
old age.

BACKGROUND: UC-II contains a patented form of undenatured type II collagen 
derived from chicken sternum. Previous preclinical and clinical studies support 
the safety and efficacy of UC-II in modulating joint discomfort in 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this study was to assess 
the efficacy and tolerability of UC-II in moderating joint function and joint 
pain due to strenuous exercise in healthy subjects.
METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted 
in healthy subjects who had no prior history of arthritic disease or joint pain 
at rest but experienced joint discomfort with physical activity. Fifty-five 
subjects who reported knee pain after participating in a standardized stepmill 
performance test were randomized to receive placebo (n = 28) or the UC-II (40 mg 
daily, n = 27) product for 120 days. Joint function was assessed by changes in 
degree of knee flexion and knee extension as well as measuring the time to 
experiencing and recovering from joint pain following strenuous stepmill 
exertion.
RESULTS: After 120 days of supplementation, subjects in the UC-II group 
exhibited a statistically significant improvement in average knee extension 
compared to placebo (81.0 ± 1.3º vs 74.0 ± 2.2º; p = 0.011) and to baseline 
(81.0 ± 1.3º vs 73.2 ± 1.9º; p = 0.002). The UC-II cohort also demonstrated a 
statistically significant change in average knee extension at day 90 
(78.8 ± 1.9º vs 73.2 ± 1.9º; p = 0.045) versus baseline. No significant change 
in knee extension was observed in the placebo group at any time. It was also 
noted that the UC-II group exercised longer before experiencing any initial 
joint discomfort at day 120 (2.8 ± 0.5 min, p = 0.019), compared to baseline 
(1.4 ± 0.2 min). By contrast, no significant changes were seen in the placebo 
group. No product related adverse events were observed during the study. At 
study conclusion, five individuals in the UC-II cohort reported no pain during 
or after the stepmill protocol (p = 0.031, within visit) as compared to one 
subject in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with 40 mg of UC-II was well tolerated and 
led to improved knee joint extension in healthy subjects. UC-II also 
demonstrated the potential to lengthen the period of pain free strenuous 
exertion and alleviate the joint pain that occasionally arises from such 
activities.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the knee joint discomfort, 
self-management behavior, and quality of life (QoL) in the middle-aged and 
elderly people in China and to clarify the relationship between the knee joint 
discomfort, self-management behavior, and QoL.
METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study and in this study, a stratified 
multistage random sampling method was used to collect data on the three factors 
such as knee joint discomfort, self-management behavior, and QoL among the 
middle-aged and elderly people in the Hunan Province. Spearman's correlation 
analysis was used to test the relationship between the knee joint discomfort, 
self-management behavior, and QoL.
RESULTS: The results of the present study showed that among them, the prevalence 
of knee pain was the highest (52.1%), followed by knee weakness (42.5%), 
numbness (41.8%), cold feeling (40.0%), tenderness (38.3%), and distension 
feeling (37.5%). Average score of self-management of knee joint discomfort in 
the middle-aged and elderly people was 2.14 ± 0.67. The level of self-management 
in each dimension ranged from high to low as emotional management, daily 
management, symptoms management, and information management. The average scores 
of physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) were 
42.85 ± 5.34 and 43.62 ± 8.43, respectively. The occurrence, frequency, and 
severity of discomfort symptoms were positively correlated with the symptoms 
management, daily management, information management, and self-management 
behaviors, and negatively correlated with the emotional management, PCS and MSC, 
except for the occurrence of discomfort symptoms (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Knee joint discomfort was prevalent in the middle-aged and elderly 
people. In addition, they displayed a low level of self-management behavior and 
poor QoL. The middle-aged and elderly people faced knee discomfort symptoms, the 
more frequent and severe symptoms, the higher level of symptom management, daily 
management, and information management, and the lower level of emotional 
management and QoL.

Hip pain is a common clinical complaint and a source of disability with 
an incidence of 12 to 15 percent among all adults over the age of 60 
years. Radiographic hip osteoarthritis affects 27% of adults above the age of 45 
years. A lifetime risk of 25% is seen in those who are older than 85 years of 
age and with a 10% lifetime risk for eventual total hip 
replacement. Osteoarthritis of the hip involves a progressive loss of articular 
cartilage. Subchondral cysts, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation 
can subsequently develop. Therapeutic hip joint injection with corticosteroids, 
hyaluronic acid, and plasma-rich platelets have formed the cornerstone of 
non-surgical management of hip pain. The important aspects of a fluoroscopic 
guided hip joint injection include: Minimize patient discomfort. Maintain 
patient safety. Maintain proper needle technique in accessing the intraarticular 
joint space.

Shoulder pain is a common clinical complaint with an annual incidence of 14.7 
per 1000 patients per year. Lifetime prevalence has reportedly been as high as 
70%. Rotator cuff pathology, acromioclavicular, and glenohumeral joint disorders 
constitute the most common causes of shoulder pain. The shoulder can also be a 
site of inflammatory conditions. Intra-articular steroid injection for 
management of adhesive capsulitis is well studied and an important cornerstone 
of management for patients with this disorder. Shoulder joint injection can be 
with or without image guidance. Image-guided shoulder arthrography is a 
technique that was first described in 1933 by Oberholzer. Schneider et al. 
described a simplified straight vertical approach with the aid of fluoroscopy 
that is the most common procedure performed today.  The important aspects of a 
fluroscopic guided shoulder joint injection include: Minimizing patient 
discomfort. Maintaining patient safety. Maintaining proper needle technique to 
enter the rotator cuff interval or the acromioclavicular joint.

CADTH Rapid Response Reports.

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a term used to describe disorders that 
involve the temporomandibular joint, the muscles of mastication and associated 
structures. Patients with TMD have a heterogeneous clinical presentation that 
can include facial pain, ear discomfort, headache and/or temporomandibular joint 
dysfunction. Causes of TMD include structural malalignment, joint trauma, 
psychiatric illness, head and cervical posture. TMD affects between 5-10% of the 
adult population and is associated with pain and dysfunction that can impact 
quality of life and reduce individual work productivity., Treatment approaches 
have included medications (analgesics, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs), physiotherapy (exercises, massage), laser, 
psychological interventions, occlusal appliances, surgery and trigger point 
injections (local anaesthetics, corticosteroids, botulinum toxin). Botulinum 
toxin type A is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction with a goal to reduce excessive 
contraction of the target muscle. Botulinum toxin type A is currently available 
in Canada under several names (e.g. Botox, Dysport, Xeomin) and is indicated for 
both cosmetic and therapeutic purposes. No botulinum toxin product has received 
approval from Health Canada for the management of TMD. Evidence to support 
coverage decisions for botulinum toxin in Canadian jurisdictions is required. A 
previous CADTH report examined a broad range of interventions for TMD. The 
current report aims to summarize evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness 
of botulinum toxin and to identify clinical practice guidelines and evidence on 
cost effectiveness.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is characterized by premature 
contact of the femur and acetabulum during hip motion. Morphologic variations of 
FAIS present as either aspherical femoral deformity (cam femoroacetabular 
impingement) or overcoverage (pincer femoroacetabular impingement) or both. 
Patients with FAIS often describe discomfort with hip flexion, adduction, and 
internal rotation. The use of hip arthroscopy to treat FAIS has risen 
substantially over the last 15 years. Given that one practice domain of the 
athletic training profession involves injury prevention and wellness protection, 
optimal FAIS treatment and management strategies warrant discussion. Sports 
medicine professionals often help patients with FAIS explore nonoperative 
exercise strategies and direct rehabilitation exercises for those who pursue 
surgery. Both approaches demonstrate key pillars of exercise program design, 
which include postural control, core stabilization, hip strength and motor 
control, and mobility. The purpose of this article is 2-fold: to present an 
overview of FAIS, including common diagnostic strategies, and commonalities in 
therapeutic approaches between nonoperative and postoperative rehabilitation for 
the treatment and management of patients with FAIS.

BACKGROUND: Aging is frequently associated with impairments of the 
musculoskeletal system and many elderly people experience joint discomfort or 
pain which might reduce their ability to move and consequently alter their 
quality of life. A beneficial effect of fish cartilage hydrolysate (FCH) on pain 
and joint function has recently been shown in an ACLT/pMMx osteoarthritis rat 
model.
METHODS: We therefore performed an exploratory, non-comparative, multi-centric 
clinical trial including 33 subjects with moderate knee joint discomfort and 
loss of functionality to investigate the efficacy of FCH on their 
algo-functional status. We further determined the potential health benefit of 
FCH in an original clinical ex vivo study investigating the role of FCH human 
metabolites on primary human chondrocytes.
RESULTS: FCH significantly improved knee pain and function, as assessed by the 
Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Moreover, FCH significantly 
reduced pain at rest and while walking, and patient global assessment (PGA), as 
assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and improved patients' quality of 
life (SF-36). FCH metabolites decreased the synthesis of catabolic factors 
(MMP-13) and pro-inflammatory mediators (NO, PGE2) and limited the inhibitory 
effect of IL-1β on the synthesis of cartilage matrix components (GAG and 
collagen).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, these data provide insights on the mode of action of FCH in 
humans and contribute to explain how FCH may relieve pain and improve joint 
function in subjects with knee discomfort. Although these preliminary data need 
to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial, they strongly support the 
potential health benefit of such an active ingredient.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the 
identifier NCT04420091 (09/06/2020).

BACKGROUND: The assessment of improvement or maintenance of joint health in 
healthy subjects is a great challenge. The aim of the study was the evaluation 
of a joint stress test to assess joint discomfort in subjects with 
activity-related knee joint discomfort (ArJD).
RESULTS: Forty-five subjects were recruited to perform the single-leg-step-down 
(SLSD) test (15 subjects per group). Subjects with ArJD of the knee (age 22-62 
years) were compared to healthy subjects (age 24-59 years) with no knee joint 
discomfort during daily life sporting activity and to subjects with 
mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis of the knee joint (OA, Kellgren score 2-3, age 
42-64 years). The subjects performed the SLSD test with two different protocols: 
(I) standardization for knee joint discomfort; (II) standardization for load on 
the knee joint. In addition, range of motion (ROM), reach test, acute pain at 
rest and after a single-leg squat and knee injury, and osteoarthritis outcome 
score (KOOS) were assessed. In OA and ArJD subjects, knee joint discomfort could 
be reproducibly induced in a short time interval of less than 10 min (200 
steps). In healthy subjects, no pain was recorded. A clear differentiation 
between study groups was observed with the SLSD test (maximal step number) as 
well as KOOS questionnaire, ROM, and reach test. In addition, a moderate to good 
intra-class correlation was shown for the investigated outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the SLSD test is a reliable tool for the 
assessment of knee joint health function in ArJD and OA subjects to study the 
improvements in their activities. Further, this model can be used as a stress 
model in intervention studies to study the impact of stress on knee joint health 
function.

Joint pain is a complex problem facing medical practitioners that has its origin 
in a host of conditions, injuries, and diseases. Between 2013 and 2015 alone, an 
estimated 54.4 million United States (US) adults (22.7%) annually were told by a 
doctor that they had some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, 
or fibromyalgia.  Physicians, researchers, and other medical providers have, for 
centuries, sought to understand the etiology and causes of joint pain in an 
effort to develop effective treatments to alleviate discomfort. Joint pain 
and/or arthritis is one of the most prevalent and expensive conditions known to 
humankind. In 2013, the American national medical costs attributable to 
arthritis were $140 billion. Additionally, with the aging population of most 
countries, the cost of treating arthritis is expected to double if not triple in 
the next several decades. As such, the need to find effective treatments, both 
medical and surgical, for the loss of articular cartilage is both important and 
financially imperative. The human knee is perhaps the most common joint to 
suffer the effects of articular cartilage loss. In a population of patients 
greater than 45-years-old, the age-standardized prevalence of radiographic 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee was reported to be between 19.2% (Framingham 
Study) to 27.8% (Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project). Additionally, in the 
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), nearly 37% 
of participants age 60 years or older had radiographic evidence of knee 
osteoarthritis. Thus, much attention has been turned to finding an effective 
method whereby the damaged or deficient articular hyaline cartilage can be 
restored to the knee. One method of surgically restoring a viable articular 
surface to the knee joint whose hyaline cartilage surface has been injured is 
through osteochondral allograft transplantation. Osteochondral allograft 
transplantation is an effective treatment when the source of knee pain is a 
large chondral defect or in the cases of post-traumatic arthritis. Ultimately, 
osteochondral allograft transplantation involves transferring allograft 
articular cartilage and subchondral bone that is appropriately size-matched to 
fill chondral defects with matured hyaline cartilage. Were one to describe this 
technique in a commonly understood metaphor, it would simulate the repair of a 
pot or chuckhole in the street by size match insertion of transplanted asphalt 
along with its attached subsurface roadbed into the defect.

Milk and dairy products are known to contain various bioactives with potential 
anti-inflammatory and immune modulating effects. Previous research has indicated 
that milk produced from hyperimmunized cows provided meaningful health benefits 
to individuals suffering from varying degrees of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis. PURPOSE: To examine the impact of MicroLactin®, a proprietary milk 
protein concentrate, on joint discomfort and physical function, exercise 
performance, quality of life and various measures of affect. METHODS: 
Non-osteoarthritic men (42.5 ± 8.9 years, 176.7 ± 6.7 cm, 89.9 ± 11.5 kg, 28.8 ± 
3.5 kg/m², n = 30) and women (46.4 ± 9.6 years, 163.1 ± 8.2 cm, 72.2 ± 13.1 kg, 
27.2 ± 5.3 kg/m², n = 28) with mild to moderate knee pain during physical 
activity were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to 
consume daily either a placebo (PLA) or MicroLactin® (ML) for a period of 8 
weeks. Participants completed a functional capacity test pre and 
post-supplementation and completed visual analog scales (VAS), a 6-min walking 
test, WOMAC and profile of mood states (POMS) to assess changes in joint health, 
discomfort, physical function, exercise performance and affect. Mixed factorial 
ANOVA was used for all statistical analysis and significance was set a priori at 
p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Distance covered in the 6-min walking significantly improved 
9% in ML versus 2% in PLA (mean difference: 110 ± 43 m, p = 0.012) in addition 
to 11 WOMAC components and 5 VAS reflective of ML improving joint health, 
discomfort and joint stability (all p < 0.05 vs. PLA). Additionally, ML also 
improved overall perceptions of neck and back health compared to PLA. Serum and 
whole blood indicators of clinical safety remained within normal ranges 
throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to placebo, daily doses of 
MicroLactin® yielded improvements in several components of the WOMAC, multiple 
visual analog scales indicative of joint health and stability, discomfort and 
pain, as well as significant improvements in distance covered during a 6-min 
walking test. Supplementation was well tolerated with no significant changes in 
whole-blood or serum markers of clinical safety.

Pain or other discomfort may arise in or around the articulation of the 
mandibular condyle with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. The pain may be 
mild or severe, acute or long-standing, and sharp or dull in character. Facial 
pain originating from the area of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be due 
to intraarticular disease, disorders of adjacent structures outside the joint, 
or a combination of both.

BACKGROUND: Joint discomfort is a widespread and growing problem in active 
adults. The rising interest in preventative nutrition has increased the demand 
for supplements reducing joint discomfort. Protocols assessing the effect of a 
nutritional intervention on health commonly involve a series of face-to-face 
meetings between participants and study staff that can weigh on resources, 
participant availabilities, and even increase dropout rates. Digital tools are 
increasingly added to protocols to facilitate study conduct, but fully digitally 
run studies are still scarce. With the increasing interest in real-world 
studies, the development of health apps for mobile devices to monitor study 
outcomes is of great importance.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this real-world study was to develop a specific mobile 
app, Ingredients for Life, to conduct a 100% digital study testing the 
effectiveness of a hydrolyzed cartilage matrix (HCM) supplement on joint 
discomfort in a heterogeneous group of healthy, active consumers.
METHODS: The Ingredients for Life mobile app using a visual analog scale was 
specifically developed to monitor the variation in joint pain after exercise by 
the study participants. A total of 201 healthy and physically active women and 
men (18-72 years old) with joint pain completed the study over a period of 16 
weeks. Participants were randomly allocated to the study groups and did not 
receive any dietary or lifestyle advice. Each participant indicated one area of 
joint pain and logged the type and duration of their weekly activities. They 
received blinded study supplements and took a daily regimen of 1 g of HCM (HCM 
group) or 1 g of maltodextrin (placebo group) for 12 weeks while weekly logging 
joint pain scores in the app. This was followed by a 4-week washout period 
during which participants continued reporting their joint pain scores (until the 
end of week 16).
RESULTS: Joint pain was reduced within 3 weeks of taking a low dosage of HCM (1 
g/day), regardless of gender, age group, and activity intensity when compared 
with the placebo group. After stopping supplementation, joint pain scores 
gradually increased but still remained significantly lower than those of the 
placebo group after 4 weeks of washout. The low dropout rate (<6% of 
participants, mainly in the placebo group) demonstrates that the digital study 
was well received by the study population.
CONCLUSIONS: The digital tool allowed us to measure a heterogeneous group of 
active adults in a real-world setting (without any lifestyle intervention), thus 
promoting inclusivity and diversity. With low dropout rates, it demonstrates 
that mobile apps can generate qualitative, quantifiable, real-world data 
showcasing supplement effectiveness. The study confirmed that the oral intake of 
a low dose (1 g/day) of HCM led to a significant reduction of joint pain from 3 
weeks after starting supplementation.

BACKGROUND: Research highlights the detrimental effects of obesity on gait 
biomechanics and the accompanied risk of lower-extremity skeletal malalignments, 
increased joint stress, pain and discomfort. Individuals with obesity typically 
show increased knee valgus angles combined with an increased step width. 
Accompanying muscular dysfunctions impede their ability to compensate for these 
alterations, especially in the frontal plane. To date, no studies are available, 
which evaluated the potential effects of an exercise program (EP) in reducing 
these unfavorable biomechanical changes.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Is a 12-week EP, which includes hip abductor and knee 
extensor strength exercises and fosters dynamic knee alignment, effective in 
positively altering gait biomechanics in children and adolescents with obesity?
METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial having children and 
adolescents with obesity assigned to an EP (n = 19) or control (n = 16) group. 
Pain, self-rated knee function, muscle strength and 3D gait analysis during 
walking and stair climbing were evaluated.
RESULTS: Results indicate that the EP was able to increase muscular strength 
especially in the hip abductors. In addition, children from the EP group walked 
with less maximum hip adduction and reduced pelvic drop during weight acceptance 
at follow-up. No changes were present in self-rated knee function, pain or 
discomfort.
SIGNIFICANCE: Even though effects were small, results indicate that an EP is an 
effective short-term possibility to counteract the progressive development of 
biomechanical malalignments of the lower extremity. Clinical parameters 
indicated that the program was feasible. Nonetheless, low adherence highlights 
the need to develop more attractive programs. CLINICAL TRIALS REG. NO:

OBJECTIVE: Several symptoms are common to knee osteoarthritis and Baker's cyst. 
To what extent each condition contributes to the patient's discomfort is still a 
matter of debate. The aim of the present study was twofold: first, to compare 
the burden of symptoms in patients with isolated knee osteoarthritis and 
patients with knee osteoarthritis associated with Baker's cyst; second, to 
assess the outcomes after conservative treatments.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: Patients suffering from monolateral idiopathic knee 
osteoarthritis were enrolled. Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data 
(KOOS scale) were collected. Ultrasound evaluation was performed according to 
standard protocols. On the basis of the clinical presentation different 
therapeutic options were used (fluid withdrawal, hyaluronic acid and/or steroids 
injections).
RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty patients were included in the study (97 with 
isolated knee osteoarthritis, 33 with knee osteoarthritis and Baker's cyst). In 
basal conditions, lower scores in KOOS sub-scales were observed in patients with 
knee osteoarthritis associated with Baker's cyst and in patients with effusion 
compared with patients without effusion. At 3 months after therapy significant 
higher scores were observed in both groups. At 6 months the scores were 
unchanged in the patients without Baker's cyst, but worsened in those with 
Baker's cyst.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that Baker's cysts associated with knee 
osteoarthritis contribute to the burden of symptoms. The conservative treatment 
of both conditions allows significant improvements, but in the medium term (6 
months) the efficacy of the therapy declines in patients with knee 
osteoarthritis associated with Baker's cyst.

Pain sensitisation in osteoarthritis.

Treating chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic joint pain (osteoarthritis 
(OA)) in particular, is challenging as the peripheral and central pain 
mechanisms are not fully discovered, and safe and as efficient analgesic drugs 
are not available. In general, the preclinical models of OA are limited to 
provide fundamental understanding of the pain mechanisms involved in patients 
with chronic joint pain (1). The pain associated with joint discomfort is highly 
variable, often underestimated by clinicians, and shows only modest association 
with crude radiological scorings. One reason for the disconnect between the 
extent of structural damage and pain is neuroplastic changes occurring in the 
peripheral and central nervous system resulting in pain sensitisation impacting 
the patient's experience of pain. In recent years, a variety of human 
quantitative and mechanistic pain assessment tools (Quantitative Sensory 
Testing, QST) have been developed, providing new opportunities for diagnostic 
phenotyping of OA patients and the associated degree of sensitisation. 
Mechanistic phenotyping has revealed specific subgroups of specifically 
sensitised OA patients, and been used as a predictive guideline to evaluate 
which patients are most likely to experience continued chronic pain after an 
otherwise technically successful knee replacement (chronic postoperative pain). 
Furthermore, such techniques may be used to profile new or existing drugs 
together with other e.g. cognitive or behavioural therapies with the potential 
to manage joint pain.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a 2-week self-administered gentle 
mechanical skin stimulation on chronic neck and shoulder discomfort. In 
participants (n = 12) with chronic neck and shoulder discomfort, subjective 
measures of pain sensation, discomfort, and difficulty in moving using a visual 
analog scale (VAS, 0-10) and objective measures of 12 different joint range of 
motions (ROMs) for the cervical and shoulder regions, using a digital 
goniometer, were collected before and after self-care with contact acupuncture, 
called microcones. The self-care for 2 weeks significantly (p < 0.001) decreased 
all VAS scores to 2.2-2.3 from baseline values of 6.0-7.4. Of the 12 ROMs 
tested, 8 were significantly increased (p < 0.013). This open-label study 
suggests the use of self-care with microcones in improving subjective symptoms 
and joint ROMs in people suffering from chronic neck and shoulder discomfort. 
However, a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial is needed to 
further investigate the efficacy and safety of microcones.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify the current status and factors 
influencing self-management of knee discomfort in middle-aged and elderly people 
in China.
METHODS: A stratified multistage cluster sampling method was used to select 
participants from communities in China from January 15 to May 31, 2020. A 
cross-sectional survey was conducted using the general information questionnaire 
and the Knee Joint Discomfort Self-management Scale. Univariate analysis and a 
generalized linear model were used to analyze the factors influencing 
self-management.
RESULTS: The prevalence of knee discomfort was 77%. Moderate to severe 
discomfort accounted for 30.5%. The average item score of self-management in 
9640 participants was 1.98 ± 0.76. The highest and lowest levels were: 'daily 
life management' and 'information management'. Gender, ethnicity, education 
level, economic source, chronic disease, knee pain in the past month, and the 
degree of self-reported knee discomfort were significant predictors of 
self-management.
CONCLUSION: The self-management of knee discomfort in middle-aged and elderly 
people is poor, and the degree of discomfort is a significant predictor. 
Healthcare providers should consider socioeconomic demographic and clinical 
characteristics to help these individuals improve their self-management skills. 
Attention should also be given to improving their ability to access health 
information and making them aware of disease risks.

Infections of the sacroiliac joint are uncommon and the diagnosis is usually 
delayed. In a retrospective study, 17 patients who had been treated for 
tuberculosis sacroiliitis between 1994 and 2004 were reviewed. Two patients were 
excluded due to a short follow-up (less than 2 years). Low back pain and 
difficulty in walking were the most common presenting features. Two patients 
presented with a buttock abscess and spondylitis of the lumbar spine was noted 
in two patients. The Gaenslen's and FABER (flexion, abduction and external 
rotation) tests were positive in all patients. Radiological changes included 
loss of cortical margins with erosion of the joints. An open biopsy and 
curettage was performed in all patients; histology revealed chronic infection 
and acid-fast bacilli were isolated in nine patients. Antituberculous (TB) 
medication was administered for 18 months and the follow-up ranged from 3 to 10 
years (mean: 5 years). The sacroiliac joint fused spontaneously within 2 years. 
Although all patients had mild discomfort in the lower back following treatment 
they had no difficulty in walking. Sacroiliac joint infection must be included 
in the differential diagnosis of lower back pain and meticulous history and 
clinical evaluation of the joint are essential.

L’infection des sacro-iliaques est rare et le diagnostic est souvent retardé. 
Dans une revue rétrospective 17 patients étaient traités pour une tuberculose 
sacro-iliaque entre 1994 et 2004. Deux patients étaient exclus à cause d’un 
suivi de moins de 2 ans. Des lombalgies et des difficultés de marche étaient les 
signes les plus fréquents. Deux patients présentaient un abcés de la fesse et 
deux autres une spondylite lombaire. Les test de Faber et de Gaenslen étaient 
positif chez tous les patients. Les signes radiologiques comportaient des 
érosions articulaires et des lyses corticales. Un curetage- biopsie était fait 
chez tous les patients et un bacille acido-résistant était isolé chez 9 
patients. Un traitement anti-tuberculeux était administré pour 18 mois et le 
suivi était de 3 à 10 ans (en moyenne 5 ans). L’articulation sacro-iliaque se 
fusionnait dans les 2 ans. Bien que tous les patients gardaient un certain 
disconfort lombaire, ils n’avaient pas de difficulté de marche. L’infection 
sacro-iliaque doit faire partie des diagnostics différentiels des lombalgies et 
une évaluation méticuleuse de l’histoire et de la clinique est essentielle.

PURPOSE: The onset of OA is affected by a variety of factors, which eventually 
lead to the loss of cartilage in the joints, the formation of osteophytes, the 
loss of normal knee mobility, and pain and discomfort, which seriously affects 
the quality of life. HUC-MSCs can promote cartilage production and have been 
widely used in research in the past decade. This article systematically 
summarizes that it is well used in basic research and clinical studies to 
promote inflammatory chondrogenesis in the treatment of OA. Provide a 
theoretical basis for clinical treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study collected CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, and articles 
related to the treatment of OA with HUC-MSCs since their publication, excluding 
non-basic and clinical studies such as reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 31 
basic experimental studies and 12 clinical studies were included. Systematically 
analyze the effects of HUC-MSCs on inhibiting inflammatory factors, promoting 
chondrocyte production, and current clinical treatment.
RESULTS: HUC-MSCs can reduce inflammatory factors such as MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, 
IL-1β, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, induced conversion from M1 to M2 in OA to protect 
cartilage damage and reduce OA inflammation. Synthesize ColII, SOX9, and 
aggrecan at the same time to promote cartilage synthesis.
CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs not only have typical stem cell biological characteristics, 
but also have rich sources and convenient material extraction. Compared with 
stem cells from other sources, HUC-MSCs have stronger proliferation, 
differentiation, and immune regulation abilities. Furthermore, there are no 
ethical issues associated with their use.
SAFETY: Primarily attributed to pain, the majority of individuals experience 
recovery within 24 h following injection. HUC-MSCs possess the ability to 
alleviate pain, enhance knee joint function, and potentially postpone the need 
for surgical intervention in both non-surgical and other cases, making them 
highly deserving of clinical promotion and application.

PURPOSE: Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) remains a viable, safe, and 
efficacious option for patients wishing to correct refractive errors. One of its 
most significant drawbacks is pain. While post-operative pain has been well 
studied with different management options, intra-operative pain has been less 
well defined. The purpose of this study was to characterize intra-operative pain 
during PRK in regard to eye operated on, gender, excimer platform used, surgeon, 
and age.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 134 patients (264 eyes) were prospectively 
randomized to undergo bilateral PRK of either the right eye first or the left 
eye first followed immediately by the fellow eye. In the immediate 
post-operative period they were surveyed using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale 
regarding intra-operative pain or discomfort experienced in each eye. Resultant 
pain scores were then analyzed via two sample z-test and analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) to characterize pain overall as well as comparing first versus second 
eye operated on, right versus left eye, male versus female, excimer platform 
used, inter-surgeon variability, and age.
RESULTS: Of 264 eyes surveyed the mean pain experienced on a 0-10 pain scale was 
1.13 (minimal discomfort). There was no statistically significant difference in 
pain or discomfort when comparing first versus second eye operated on, right 
versus left eye, male versus female, excimer platform used, operating surgeon, 
or age.
CONCLUSION: Intra-operative pain or discomfort experienced by patients is 
minimal. The absence of statistically significant differences in pain scores 
studied implies that standard of care procedures achieve adequate analgesia in 
PRK.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore symptom trajectories over 24 months for hot 
flushes and sweating, sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, and 
physical and mental exhaustion experienced by premenopausal women diagnosed with 
tamoxifen-treated breast cancer.
METHODS: A total of 104 patients participated in the study. The menopausal 
symptoms were examined using the Menopausal Rating Scale at baseline, 3-6, 12, 
and 18-24 months after initiating tamoxifen. The changes over four time points 
were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The chi-square test 
was used to examine the differences between "no symptom-to-mild" and 
"moderate-to-extremely severe" 3-6 months after initiating tamoxifen according 
to the patients' chemotherapy treatment experiences.
RESULTS: All menopausal symptoms occurred in > 70% of patients with breast 
cancer and persisted until 24 months. More than 50% of patients experienced four 
menopausal symptoms, with at least two at a serious severity level after 
initiating tamoxifen. Hot flushes and sweating occurred in the highest number of 
patients, recording high scores. Sleep problems and physical and mental 
exhaustion exhibited relatively high scores, even before tamoxifen initiation. 
There were significant changes over four time points in all symptoms. Young 
patients aged < 40 years experienced more severe sleep problems, and patients 
who had previously received chemotherapy experienced more severe joint and 
muscular discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings may assist in alerting healthcare providers 
to menopausal symptoms that develop during tamoxifen therapy and the need for 
early and active intervention to minimize symptom occurrence and distress.

Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are a common health condition caused by 
the structural or functional disorders of masticatory muscles and the 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Abnormal mandibular movement in TMD patients may 
cause pain, chronic inflammation, and other discomfort, which could be relieved 
by a variety of drugs through various delivery systems. In this study, we 
summarized commonly used therapeutic agents in the management of TMD as well as 
novel bioactive molecules in preclinical stage and clinical trials. The emerging 
therapy strategies such as novel intra-TMJ delivery systems and implants based 
on tissue engineering are also discussed. This comprehensive review will 
strengthen our understanding of pharmacological approaches for TMD therapy.

PURPOSE: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study was 
conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of E-PR-01, a proprietary 
formula containing Vitex negundo and Zingiber officinale, on knee joint 
discomfort due to pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty adults aged 20-60 years with self-reported pain 
score of ≤30 mm at rest and ≥60 mm post-exertion on a 100-mm visual analog scale 
(VAS) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the E-PR-01 (200 mg twice 
daily) or placebo for 5 days. The primary outcome was time to achieve meaningful 
pain relief (MPR) (≥40% reduction in post-exertion pain VAS score from baseline) 
post-single dose of intervention on day 1 compared to placebo. The secondary 
outcomes were post-exertion pain intensity difference (PID) at 2-, 3- and 
4-hours and time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) over 4 hours 
post single dose on day 1; post-exertion VAS score at 4 hours' post-intervention 
on day 5; percentage of responders on day 1; and physical efficiency as assessed 
by the total duration of exercise sessions completed after single dose of IP 
compared to placebo.
RESULTS: The average time to achieve MPR was 3.38 hours, 32.50% of participants 
achieved it in the E-PR-01 group post single-dose administration on day 1 as 
opposed to the placebo where no participant achieved MPR. There were significant 
intergroup differences in PID (-23.58 vs 2.45 mm) and SPID (-67.48 vs -0.08 mm) 
at 4 hours of E-PR-01 and placebo administration on day 1. 95% of participants 
in the IP group experienced some degree of pain relief within 2 hours compared 
to 37.5% in the placebo group.
CONCLUSION: A single dose of E-PR-01 provided a statistically significant as 
well as clinically meaningful reduction in exercise-induced knee joint 
discomfort within 4 hours of administration.

Arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, hallux rigid, is a 
common and disabling source of foot pain in the adult population. Hallux rigidus 
is characterized by diseased cartilage and large, periarticular osteophytes that 
result in a stiff, painful joint. Activity modification, sensible shoes, 
orthotics, anti-inflammatory medications and occasional intra-articular steroid 
injections can be attempted to alleviate the discomfort associated with hallux 
rigidus. A number of surgical options exist for the treatment of recalcitrant 
hallux rigidus. Cheilectomy is a useful treatment for dorsal impingement pain 
seen in mild hallux rigidus. A new polyvinyl alcohol hemi-arthroplasty implant 
has shown promising early and midterm results in the treatment of advanced 
hallux rigidus; however, arthrodesis of the first MTP joint remains the gold 
standard treatment for advanced hallux rigidus because of unpredictable outcomes 
after early-generation joint replacement implants.

INTRODUCTION: Fosfomycin is a wide spectrum bactericidal antibiotic with a 
unique mode of action, low toxicity, and good penetration in tissues with 
deep-seated infections, including bone and joint infections.
AREAS COVERED: Data were extracted from 19 published articles. Three hundred and 
sixty-five patients, with broad age range, received intravenous fosfomycin for 
the treatment of bone and joint infections (including arthritis, acute and 
chronic osteomyelitis, discitis, periprosthetic joint infection). Fosfomycin was 
given as part of a combination antimicrobial therapy in the majority of patients 
(93.7%). The dosage of fosfomycin ranged from 4 g/day (in one case) to 24 g/day. 
The dosage of fosfomycin, in some cases, mostly pediatric, was calculated based 
on body weight, ranging from 50 mg/kg/day to 250 mg/kg/day. The duration of 
fosfomycin treatment ranged from a couple of days up to 3 months. The most 
common isolated pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (38.9%). Three hundred 
patients (82.2%) were successfully treated. Fosfomycin was well tolerated, as 
few patients developed mild adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal discomfort, 
hypernatremia, skin rash, and neutropenia.
EXPERT OPINION: The available data suggests that intravenous fosfomycin may be 
beneficial for the treatment of patients with bone and joint infections, 
especially when used as part of a combination antibiotic regimen.

Joint pain and disease affects more than one in four adults in the United 
States. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to 
investigate the efficacy of a hydrolyzed chicken collagen type II (HCII) 
supplement in reducing joint-related discomfort such as pain and stiffness, and 
in improving mobility. We enrolled adults aged 40-65 (65.5% were women) who had 
joint discomfort, but had no co-morbidities, and who were not taking pain 
medications. The participants were randomized to receive either the HCII 
supplement (n = 47) or a placebo (n = 43) for eight weeks. At the baseline, and 
at week 4 and week 8, we administered the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) survey with three additional wrist-related 
questions and the Visual Analog Scale for assessments of joint-related symptoms. 
In the WOMAC stiffness and physical activity domains and in the overall WOMAC 
score, the HCII group had a significant reduction in joint-related discomforts 
compared with the placebo group. For example, at week 4, the HCII group had a 
36.9% reduction in the overall WOMAC score, compared with a 14.3% reduction in 
the placebo group (p = 0.027). This HCII product is effective in reducing joint 
pain and stiffness and in improving joint function among otherwise healthy 
adults.

Osteonecrosis is a terrible condition that can cause advanced arthritis in a 
number of joints, including the knee. The three types of osteonecrosis that can 
affect the knee are secondary, post-arthroscopic, and spontaneous osteonecrosis 
of the knee (SPONK). Regardless of osteonecrosis classification, treatment for 
this condition seeks to prevent further development or postpone the onset of 
knee end-stage arthritis. Joint arthroplasty is the best course of action 
whenever there is significant joint surface collapse or there are signs of 
degenerative arthritis. The non-operative options for treatment at the moment 
include observation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), 
protective weight bearing, and analgesia if needed. Depending on the severity 
and type of the condition, operational procedures may include unilateral knee 
arthroplasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or joint preservation 
surgery. Joint preservation techniques, such as arthroscopy, core decompression, 
osteochondral autograft, and bone grafting, are frequently used in precollapse 
and some postcollapse lesions, when the articular cartilage is typically 
unaffected and only the underlying subchondral bone is affected. In contrast, 
operations that try to save the joint following significant subchondral collapse 
are rarely successful and joint replacement is required to ease discomfort. This 
article's goal is to summarise the most recent research on evaluations, clinical 
examinations, imaging and various therapeutic strategies for osteonecrosis of 
the knee, including lesion surveillance, medicines, joint preservation methods, 
and total joint arthroplasty.

Acute monoarticular arthropathies are a common source for Emergency Department 
(ED) visits, with septic arthritis alone having an annual incidence of 10 per 
100,000 patients in the United States. In the ED, the most critical of these 
arthropathies to diagnose and treat is septic arthritis. While lab values and 
vital signs may assist with the diagnosis of septic arthritis, the gold standard 
test is done via analysis of the synovial fluid following arthrocentesis. If the 
synovial fluid sample is concerning for septic arthritis, the patient should 
then be started on intravenous antibiotics, and orthopedics should be 
immediately consulted. Arthrocentesis is a common procedure that is frequently 
performed in the ED as it has both diagnostic and therapeutic value. 
Traditionally, arthrocentesis was performed blindly using critical landmarks to 
aspirate effusions for comfort or diagnosis. However, using a landmark-based 
approach has some limitations due to variance in anatomy and effusion, with 
success rates ranging from 61 to 78% depending on the joint that is being 
assessed. Ultrasonography has been adopted as an adjunct for many emergent and 
urgent procedures, including arthrocentesis, as it adds some distinct advantages 
over a blind landmark-based approach. The primary advantage of ultrasound (US) 
guided arthrocentesis offers the user direct visualization of the effusion. By 
visualizing the effusion and using an in-plane or out-of-plane needle technique, 
the clinician can perform arthrocentesis with greater accuracy and fewer 
attempts. Additionally, US-guided arthrocentesis can detect small effusions that 
potentially would not be assessed using a landmark-based technique due to an 
inability to aspirate small volume effusions. It has been found that the US can 
detect effusions as small as 4 ml of fluid in the joint space. Finally, studies 
have demonstrated that the US-guided arthrocentesis techniques allow the 
clinician to aspirate more volume and decrease a patient’s perceived pain scores 
during the procedure. Critically, the adoption of the US as an adjunct to 
arthrocentesis has also been shown to lead to quicker time to diagnosis and 
management of septic arthritis.  While perhaps intuitive, many of the 
aforementioned advantages make US-guided arthrocentesis relevant for managing 
arthropathies in the pediatric population.  Pediatric patients will inherently 
have smaller joints, smaller joint effusion sizes, and potentially be less able 
to tolerate the discomfort during the procedure. Effusion detection with the US 
has been shown to have a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 90%, 
respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity of US for the diagnosis of 
effusion in the pediatric population must be determined. Still, the assessment 
of the hip demonstrates the potential for US application in the assessment of 
pediatric arthropathy. Beyond diagnosis, multiple case reports have shown that 
US-guided arthrocentesis can be safely performed in the pediatric hip and knee.  
While the literature is more robust at this time for the adult population, in 
general, US-guided arthrocentesis techniques may be used at most major joints of 
the body. Discussed below are common US-guided arthrocentesis techniques for all 
of the major joints of the upper and lower extremity. Some of the described 
techniques will have technical variations in the literature (i.e., in-plane vs. 
the out-of-plane US-guided arthrocentesis). This article will discuss the 
authors’ preferred approach, but additional techniques are in the literature. 
Finally, while this article focuses on using the US as an adjunct for 
arthrocentesis, many of these same techniques may be utilized for 
intra-articular joint injections in the appropriate clinical setting.

OBJECTIVE: Curcuma longa has been widely used in Ayurveda for its medicinal 
properties and Turmacin was developed from C. longa as a standardized extract 
containing turmerosaccharides. In this clinical trial, the effect of Turmacin on 
knee joint discomfort in healthy adults subjected to strenuous physical activity 
was evaluated.
DESIGN: Double-blind, triple-arm, parallel-group, randomized placebo-controlled 
trial.
SETTING: Healthy participants from an urban tertiary care teaching hospital.
INTERVENTION: Healthy participants were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
either Turmacin 0.5 g/1 g or placebo once daily for 84 days. The participants 
were subjected to 10-minute strenuous exercise.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to initial pain, final pain score on a visual analogue 
scale, range of movement (ROM) of knee and the force of contractions of muscles 
around the knee joint.
RESULTS: A total of n = 90 participants were recruited. The mean final pain 
scores were significantly lower in the Turmacin 1 g and Turmacin 0.5 g when 
compared with the placebo from day-7 and day-5 onwards respectively. The 
survival analysis consistently showed a decreased hazard for early onset of pain 
in both the Turmacin groups. On day-84, the difference in mean ROM between 
Turmacin 0.5 g and placebo was 4.79 degrees (p = 0.008) and that for Turmacin 
1 g and placebo was 2.34 degrees (p = 0.306). The difference in muscle force for 
isokinetic contractions of the quadriceps at angular velocities of 120 and 180 
was significant between Turmacin 0.5 g and placebo (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005 
respectively) while that for Turmacin 1 g & Turmacin 0.5 g (p = 0.206 and 
p = 0.414 respectively) and Turmacin 1 g & Placebo (p = 0.046 and p = 0.037) 
were not significant. However, in the within group analysis participants in 
Turmacin 1 g group had better preserved muscle functions than Turmacin 0.5 g 
group at angular velocities of 120 and 180 when compared with placebo.
CONCLUSION: Turmacin (0.5 g and 1 g) was efficacious when compared to placebo in 
increasing the pain threshold and knee ROM in healthy participants with minor 
adverse events.

The use of knee braces is common, and there is an abundance of different brace 
types available both "over the counter" and as "prescription devices". The 
braces are used for a range of knee problems ranging from minor knee discomfort 
to post-surgical rehabilitation. The available evidence is generally in favour 
of brace applications although the amount and quality of evidence is moderate to 
low with a positive benefit-harm balance. However, braces should generally not 
be used as a stand-alone or primary treatment strategy, but can be used as a 
potentially beneficial supplement to patients with knee disorders if needed.

Rheumatic symptoms (or rheumatism) are distinguished by the following seven 
characteristics: (1) pain or discomfort, usually perceived in the vicinity of 
one or more joints (including the spine); (2) pain on motion of the affected 
area(s); (3) soreness (to the touch) of the affected region(s); (4) stiffness of 
the affected part(s), especially after a period of immobility; (5) symptomatic 
improvement after mild exercise, but worsening after vigorous exercise; (6) 
symptomatic worsening in response to climatic factors, especially falling 
barometric pressure and rising humidity; and (7) symptomatic improvement in 
response to warming the affected area(s). Not all rheumatic pain syndromes have 
all seven characteristics, but most will at least have the first four.

The term "temporomandibular disorders" (TMDs) refers to a variety of problems 
involving the muscles of the masticatory system and the jaw. The most common 
symptoms of TMD are pain in the face, headaches, clicking or popping in the 
joints, and difficulties with jaw function. The severity of TMD can be measured 
with a number of different scales, including the Helkimo, Craniomandibular Index 
(CMI), Mandibular Functional Impairment Questionnaire (MFIQ), Fonseca scale and 
Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) scales. The former 
focuses on the patient's chief complaint, while the latter takes into account 
secondary symptoms such as limited mobility, impaired temporomandibular joint 
(TMJ) function, muscle pain, and discomfort during mandibular motion. According 
to the severity of the issue, the results can be used to categorise the 
situation. To effectively treat TMD, one must first determine their index score 
and then formulate a treatment strategy based on that score.

BACKGROUND: In the immediate postoperative period surgical breast cancer 
patients can face many problems including functional limitation of the shoulder, 
edema, pain and depression. Although those symptoms can alleviate during the 
stages of the therapeutic route, most of the time concur significantly to the 
everyday life discomforts decreasing sharply the quality of life. Therefore, is 
essential to pay attention to the functional problems of breast cancer patients 
in order to ensure a quick and complete physical and psychosocial recovery.
AIM: Aim of this study, comparing 2 groups of patients, one that underwent to 
early physical rehabilitation program (EPRP) and one as a control group, is to 
evaluate: functional improvements of the glenohumeral joint mobility, antalgic 
effect of EPRP, improvements and/or worsening of quality of life.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled study.
SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient clinic, Breast Unit, "San Giuseppe Moscati" 
Hospital, Avellino, Italy.
POPULATION: Seventy women planned for Madden's modified radical mastectomy or 
for segmental mastectomy with axillary dissection in the period from March 2010 
to February 2011.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to treated and control group. All 
participants were evaluated before surgery and postoperatively at fifth day, 
first, sixth and twelfth month. Patients of the treated group, underwent first, 
to assisted cautious mobilization of hand, wrist and elbow and after drainage 
removal, to twenty physiotherapy sessions under the guide of a physiotherapist.
RESULTS: Within group statistical analysis evidenced that TG regained normal 
function at 1 year after surgery while CG was unable to do so for flexion, 
abduction and internal rotation movements. TG manifested general and 
statistically significative improvements in QoL. Improvements in the grade of 
pain perceived were observed starting from the first postoperative month.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative early physical rehabilitation programme in surgical 
breast cancer patients surgically treated significantly improves glenohumeral 
joint mobility, reduces pain and widely improves the quality of life.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Early rehabilitation plays a key role in the 
physical and psycho-social recovery for breast cancer patients surgically 
treated with axillary dissection.

INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular joint dislocation is described as the movement 
of mandibular condyle out of the fossa beyond its anatomical and functional 
boundaries causing pain and discomfort. It is often managed by conservative 
methods, but in long-standing, chronic conditions, surgical treatment is the 
only option. The goal of surgical treatment is to reposition the condyle and 
prevent further recurrences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis involving a single center and 
a surgeon with 19 patients and 23 joint surgeries performed over a 10-year 
period. Patients who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria and had earlier 
undergone surgical correction with hook-shaped miniplates and miniscrews fixed 
with or without bone grafts formed the study group.
RESULTS: In all, 12 were female (mean age, 41.9 ± 12.07 years) and the rest 9 
were male (mean age, 39.8 ± 13.6 years), ranging from 32 years to 58 years. All 
patients had the dislocation for an average period of 19.26 ± 12.6 months before 
the surgery. The mean maximal mouth opening (without pain) preoperatively was 
17.78 ± 2.13 mm (12-25 mm) while postoperatively it was 32.28 ± 3.17 mm (27-37 
mm). There were no immediate or late surgical complications in the follow-up 
period that ranged from 8 to 37 months.
DISCUSSION: When proper case selection is employed and properly done, using 
hook-shaped miniplates with or without bone graft is more cost-effective, giving 
excellent short- and long-term effects.
CONCLUSION: The results in this Indian population are very similar to that 
reported from other parts of the world.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy has been accepted to 
treat a wide range of illnesses, including phantom limb pain, joint pain, low 
back pain, and cervical discomfort. TENS is not frequently used in dentistry, 
despite its potential advantages. 3, 4 Therefore, the rationale of present 
review is to discuss its dental applications in order to spread awareness of 
them among the dental profession.

First evidence indicates that the supplementation of specific collagen peptides 
is associated with a significant reduction in activity-related joint pain in 
young adults. The purpose of the current investigation was to confirm the 
efficacy of the same collagen peptides in a comparable study population. In 
total, 180 active men and women aged between 18 and 30 years with 
exercise-related knee pain but no diagnosed joint disease completed the trial 
over a period of 12 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to the group 
receiving 5 g of specific collagen peptides (CP-G) or to the placebo group 
(P-G). For the primary outcome, changes in pain during or after exercise from 
pre- to post-intervention were assessed by the participants using the Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS). These changes were additionally evaluated by the examining 
physician by means of anamnesis and physical examination of the affected knee 
joint. As secondary outcomes, pain under resting conditions and after 20 squats 
were compared between the study groups. In addition, the mobility of the knee 
joint and the use of alternative therapies (e.g., ointments or physiotherapy) 
were recorded. The supplementation of specific collagen peptides derived from 
type I collagen with a mean molecular weight of 3 kDa led to a significantly (p 
= 0.024) higher reduction of exercise-induced knee pain (-21.9 ± 18.3 mm) 
compared with the placebo group (-15.6 ± 18.5 mm). These findings were 
consistent with the physician's evaluation (-23.0 ± 19.2 mm vs. -14.6 ± 17.9 mm, 
p = 0.003). The decrease in pain under resting conditions and after squats did 
not significantly differ between the groups, as only a small number of 
participants suffered from pain under these conditions. Due to the clinically 
unremarkable baseline values, the mobility of the knee joint did not change 
significantly after the intervention. In conclusion, the current investigation 
confirmed that the oral intake of bioactive collagen peptides used in the 
current investigation led to a statistically significant reduction of 
activity-related joint pain in young active adults suffering from knee joint 
discomfort.

Joint problems impair performance during exercise and daily activities and 
influence quality of life. The present study aimed to examine the effects of a 
combination of six non-essential amino acids (6AA) on joint conditions in an 
adult population. A total of 50 participants aged between 20 and 64 years with 
joint discomfort but no diagnosed joint disorder were randomly and blindly 
assigned to a control or 6AA group. The 6AA group took 12 g of the non-essential 
amino acid formulation orally (4 g three times a day) and the control group took 
equivalent doses of a placebo. Each group maintained the daily dose for 12 
weeks. Primary outcome measures were evaluated with the visual analogue scale 
(VAS), the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM), and the Japanese 
Orthopaedic Association score (JOA). These tests were taken before the 
experiment began at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the intervention. The results of 
the VAS indicated that 6AA improved joint pain, discomfort, and stiffness both 
during a resting state and during normal activity. Participants' scores on the 
JKOM and JOA also showed significant improvements in the group that had taken 
the 6AA supplement. These results demonstrate that 6AA improves symptoms of 
joint problems, such as pain, discomfort, stiffness, and difficulty in 
performing daily activities after 4 weeks of daily consumption.

Sternoclavicular joint pathology can be an uncommon cause of pain and discomfort 
around the neck and shoulder region. Typically, patients localize their pain 
deep to the joint and experience referred pain to the ipsilateral neck and 
shoulder; however, it often presents as a diffuse nonspecific pain. Given the 
paucity of this pathology and atypical presentation, the use of injections can 
be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of sternoclavicular arthropathy. Currently, 
most injections are done via computed tomography. Although this method is 
accurate, it exposes patients to radiation and burdens the patient with the 
requirement of multiple appointments. This case series outlines the use of 
ultrasound-guided sternoclavicular joint injections conducted in the clinic. The 
patients in this series underwent an ultrasound-guided injection in the affected 
sternoclavicular joint, which confirmed the diagnosis, and they were 
subsequently treated with resection arthroplasty. The use of ultrasound-guided 
injections of the sternoclavicular joint is a safe and accurate alternative 
diagnostic method, which saves the patient from harmful radiation and additional 
appointments. Limitations and efficacy may vary depending on skill and comfort 
level of the operator.

We share the concept of a multisystemic syndrome which affects the muscle, bone, 
joints and nerves, in varying manners. The MOAN 
(musculo-osteo-arthro-neuropathic) syndrome highlights the close relationship 
between these four organ-systems, and their contribution to each other's health 
and disease. The mnemonic MOAN also underscores the discomfort and pain 
associated with the condition and encourages health professionals to address 
these patients in a holistic manner, rather than just addressing one of the 
components.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain frequently occurs in more than one body region, 
with up to 80% of adults reporting more than one joint pain site in the last 
12 months. Older people and females are known to be more susceptible to multiple 
joint pain sites, however the association of multisite joint pain with physical 
and psychosocial functions in this population are unknown.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 579 women were analyzed. Women were asked 
"Which of your joints have been troublesome on most days of the past month?" 
Pain qualities were measured using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Short Form) 
and PainDETECT, and health was assessed using the SF-36 and sociodemographic 
variables. Statistical analysis using generalized ordinal logistic regression 
included comparison of three joint pain groups: no joint pain, 1-4 sites of 
joint pain and ≥ 5 sites of joint pain.
RESULTS: Two thirds of respondents had multisite pain (>1 site), and one third 
had ≥5 joint pain sites. Compared to women with fewer joint pain sites, women 
with >5 joint pain sites (multisite joint pain) had significantly poorer 
physical and emotional health-related quality of life, more severe pain, a 
higher probability of neuropathic pain, and a longer duration of pain. More than 
half of women in the multisite joint pain group were still employed, 
statistically significantly more than women with no joint pain. In the final 
model, pain duration, the number of medications, pain intensity (discomforting 
and distressing) and the physical component of health-related quality of life 
were significantly associated with increased number of joint pain sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of older women in our sample had >5 painful joints 
in the last month. These women demonstrated significantly poorer psychosocial 
health, and increased medication use, than women with no or fewer sites of joint 
pain. Many women with multisite joint pain were still in the workforce, even 
when nearing retirement age. This study has important implications for future 
research into musculoskeletal pain, particularly in regards to womens health and 
wellbeing, and for clinical practice where there should be increased awareness 
of the implications of concurrent, multisite joint pain.

BACKGROUND: Joint range of motion might affected by some factors like laxity and 
increase joint mobility. Generalized joint hypermobility and temporomandibular 
joint hypermobility (TMJH) are reported as risk factors for temporomandibular 
disorders. The aim of this study was to survey the etiological factors of TMJH 
and its relations to habitual status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 69 patients 
with TMJH were involved. After profiling personal information and medical 
history, the patients were divided into three groups based on their maximum 
mouth opening (MMO) as follow: (Light) MMO of 50-55 mm, (moderate): MMO between 
55 and 65 mm, (severe) MMO >65 mm. For subjective observations, patients were 
asked to fill the prepared questionnaire. The objective evaluations conducted by 
a specialist. Finally, all the data subjected Chi-Square test by using SPSS 
software version 22 at a significant level of 0.05.
RESULTS: TMJH was more common in women (74.2%). The light group had significant 
differences with other groups in the discomfort of TMJ and TMJ sound (P < 0.05). 
Furthermore, sever group manifested highest percentage of masticatory pains, 
significantly (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that pain in TMJ would have a correlation with 
MMO.

A cross sectional analytical study was conducted from September 26 to December 
28 2018 at Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University Islamabad with 111 undergraduate 
students aged 17-26 years as participants. The aim of the study was to establish 
the normative values of cervical joint positioning error (CJPE) and its 
association with cervical spine mechanics. Neck discomfort was measured using 
the neck portion of the "student specific Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort 
Questionnaire" (ssCMDQ) and CJPE was measured via cervico-cephalic relocation 
test using a goniometer. Non-parametric tests of significance were used because 
the data was not normally distributed in terms of normality testing. Normative 
values of CJPE were noted to be highest in flexion (9o±9o), rotation towards 
left (9o±6o) and right (8o±7o), extension (6o±8o), and lastly lateral flexion 
towards left (5o±7o) and right (5o±5o). Higher CJPE in all movements was 
observed among females; however, no significant statistical differences were 
observed (p>0.05). In terms of correlation, important trends included 
significantly positive correlation of neck discomfort with CJPE in extension, 
and of CJPE in lateral flexion towards the left with CJPE in lateral flexion 
towards the right and flexion (p<0.05).

Calcaneus malunion is a common sequela to calcaneal fractures and is a cause of 
pain and discomfort. Multiple approaches have been described to address the 
subtalar joint and the lateral wall. Type 2 malunion is the most commonly 
encountered problem, and is usually addressed by the sinus tarsi approach. This 
has some limitations, as exposure for lateral wall excision beneath the peroneal 
tendons maybe a problem. We have slightly modified the sinus tarsi approach by a 
more horizontal skin incision, which may even be extended proximally by 1-2 cm; 
this allows access to the lateral wall on either side of the peroneal tendons. 
The approach is described in detail.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatoryarthropathy that affects 
joints and entheses andis associated with psoriasis (PsO). There are 
fiveclinical patterns of PsA: symmetrical polyarthritis,distal interphalangeal 
arthropathy, asymmetricaloligoarthritis, arthritis mutilans, and spondylitis, 
withor without sacroiliitis. Concerning PsA, the goals oftherapy are to control 
inflammation, prevent articulardamage, and reduce discomfort in the affected 
joints.Although there are many therapeutic options forthe treatment of PsAs, 
physicians most often beginwith nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)for 
mild disease. Disease-modifying anti-rheumaticdrugs (DMARDS) are reserved for 
moderate to severedisease. Apremilast may be a useful option for somepatients.

BACKGROUND: Sacroiliac joint tuberculosis(SJT) is relatively uncommon, but it 
may cause severe sacroiliac joint destruction and functional disorder. Few 
studies in the literature have been presented on SJT, reports of surgical 
treatment for SJT are even fewer. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 
surgical management of patients with severe SJT of 3 different types and 
proposed to reveal the clinical manifestations and features and aim to determine 
the efficiency and security of such surgical treatment.
METHODS: We reviewed 17 patients with severe SJT of 3 different types who 
underwent posterior open-window focal debridement and bone graft for joint 
fusion. Among them,five patients with anterior sacral abscess had anterior 
abscess curettage before debridement. Two patients with lumbar vertebral 
tuberculosis received one-stage posterior tuberculous debridement, interbody 
fusion and instrumentation. Follow-up was performed 36 months (26 to 45 months) 
using the following parameters: erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), status of 
joint bony fusion on CT scan, visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI).
RESULTS: Buttock pain and low back pain were progressively relieved with time. 
6 months later, pain was not obvious, and ESR resumed to normal levels within 
3 months. Solid fusion of the sacroiliac joint occurred within 12 months in all 
cases. No complications or recurrence occurred. At final follow-up, all patients 
had no pain or only minimal discomfort over the affected joint and almost 
complete functional recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior open-window focal debridement and joint fusion is an 
efficient and secure surgical method to treat severe SJT. If there is an abscess 
in the front of the sacroiliac joint, anterior abscess curettage should be 
performed as a supplement.

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the elbow is an uncommon condition in which the 
clinical manifestations are often at variance with the radiological findings. In 
symptomatic forms, pain and stiffness are variably combined. When non-operative 
management fails, the decision to perform surgery is taken on a case-by-case 
basis depending on age, activity level, patient discomfort, and osteoarthritis 
location and severity as assessed by CT scan arthrography. Elbow instability or 
subluxation should be sought. Post-traumatic elbow osteoarthritis raises 
difficult therapeutic problems in young patients. The goal of treatment is to 
obtain a low level of pain with sufficient motion range to ensure good function, 
while preserving future surgical options and delaying elbow arthroplasty to the 
extent possible.

Unintended consequences of COVID-19 safety measures on patients with chronic 
knee pain forced to defer joint replacement surgery.

In recent months, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American 
College of Surgeons and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
officially recommended the delay of nonemergency procedures until the public 
health crisis is resolved. Deferring elective joint replacement surgeries for an 
unknown period is likely to decrease the incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 
but is likely to have detrimental effects in individuals suffering from chronic 
knee pain. These detrimental effects extend beyond the discomfort of 
osteoarthritis (OA) and the inconvenience of rescheduling surgery. Disabling 
pain is a driving factor for individuals to seek medical intervention, including 
pharmacological palliative treatment and surgical procedures. The need for 
surgical intervention due to chronic pain as for knee and hip replacement is now 
put on hold indefinitely because access to surgical care has been limited. 
Although a moderate delay in surgical intervention may not produce a significant 
progression of OA within the knee, it could lead to muscle wasting due to 
immobility and exacerbate comorbidities, making rehabilitation more challenging. 
Importantly, it will have an impact on comorbidities driven by OA severity, 
notably decreased quality of life and depression. These patients with 
unremitting pain become increasingly susceptible to substance use disorders 
including opioids, alcohol, as well as prescription and illegal drugs. 
Appreciation of this downstream crisis created by delayed surgical correction 
requires aggressive consideration of nonsurgical, nonopiate supported 
interventions to reduce the morbidity associated with these delays brought upon 
by the currently restricted access to joint repair.

CONTEXT: Tetrahydro iso-α acids (THIAAs), derived from Humulus lupulus (hops), 
have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in an animal model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Undenatured type 2 collagen has been found to be 
effective in clinical studies in RA and osteoarthritis (OA).
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 
proprietary tablet containing 150 mg of n-enriched THIAA (nTHIAA) and 10 mg of 
undenatured type 2 collagen (UC-II) (containing 25% UC-II) in patients with 
arthritis.
DESIGN: The study was an open-label case series. This article also includes a 
case history for 1 participant.
SETTING: The study was conducted at the Functional Medicine Research Center 
(FMRC) in Gig Harbor, WA, USA, from February 2013-June 2013.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 17 adults, 12 women, and 5 men aged 39-69 y, who 
had chronic joint pain involving various joints, 13 with probable OA and 4 with 
possible RA.
INTERVENTION: Participants took 2 tablets of nTHIAA + UC-II 2 ×/d with meals for 
12 wk.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed arthritis-related and quality-of-life 
questionnaires, at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12: (1) the visual analog scale for pain 
(VAS-P); (2) the medical symptoms questionnaire (MSQ), with the analysis 
particularly focusing on the joint/muscle subscale and total scores; (3) the 
health and wellness outcome questionnaire (MOS-SF36), with the analysis 
particularly focusing on the physical and mental subscales; (4) the arthritis 
impact questionnaire (AIQ), with the analysis particularly focusing on the 
arthritis symptoms and daily living subscales; (5) the health assessment 
questionnaire (HAQ-DI) with the analysis particularly focusing on question 26 
(Q26), which indicates overall pain during the week prior to the survey; and (6) 
the arthritis impact measurement scales 2 (AIMS2). At 12 wk, participants also 
completed the visual analog scale for efficacy (VAS-E).
RESULTS: All participants completed the 12-wk evaluation, and all reported 
improvements in pain. Significant improvements in scores on the questionnaires 
were observed as early as 2 wk. For example, the total score on the MSQ was 
significantly decreased from a mean of 20.76 ± 2.90 (SE) at baseline to 12.24 ± 
2.81 after 2 wk (P < .001). At 12 wk, the participants rated the supplement's 
efficacy at 7.6 ± 0.6 of 10. At baseline, 13 of the 17 participants were using 
analgesics for joint pain, compared with only 4 participants at 12 wk. Two of 
those 4 had reduced their analgesic dosages. The studied supplement was well 
tolerated, and no serious side effects occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The supplement containing nTHIAA and UC-II is safe and efficacious 
in participants with chronic joint pain.

The distal tibiofibular syndesmosis (DTFS) is frequently injured during ankle 
trauma. The sequelae can be significant, including chronic instability, early 
osteoarthritis and residual pain. The aim of this study is to summarize the 
current state knowledge about these injuries by answering four questions. They 
frequently occur in the context of an ankle sprain (20-40% of cases) or during 
various types of ankle fractures (20-100% of cases). They cannot be ruled out 
based solely on fracture type and must be investigated when a fibular or 
posterior malleolar fracture is present. Clinical examination and imaging are 
essential but do not provide a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography, CT scan 
and MRI have high sensitivity, but their static nature does not allow a 
treatment strategy to be defined. Dynamic radiographs must be taken, either with 
load or during a procedure. If instability is detected, stabilization is the 
general rule. In fracture cases, reduction is achieved by restoring the length 
and rotation of the distal fibular fragment, preferably during an open 
procedure. In sprain cases, reduction is not a problem unless there is ligament 
interposition. Tibiofibular fixation is done 1.5 to 3cm from the talocrural 
joint, while ensuring the reduction is perfect. The main 
complication-non-healing of the syndesmosis-is attributed to poor initial 
reduction. This or functional discomfort during weight bearing will require 
removal of the fixation hardware. In most cases, this allows functional recovery 
and correction of the inadequate reduction. Persistence of instability will 
require ligament reconstruction or fusion of the syndesmosis. Chronic 
instability can lead to ankle osteoarthritis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V, expert 
opinion.

Empirical Suitability of Scoring Systems of Observational Techniques for 
Repetitive Movements Based on Discomfort.

Republic of Korea.

This study empirically investigated the effects of repetitive movements of body 
parts through an experiment, and evaluated the suitability of the scoring 
systems of the existing observational methods for repetitive movements, based on 
the experimental results. Eighteen healthy college students participated in the 
experiment to assess discomfort, wherein joint movement, its repetition, and 
external load were used as independent variables. Postural loads for 16 postures 
used in the experiment were assessed using rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) 
and loading on the entire body assessment (LEBA). Three independent variables, 
joint motion, its repetition, and external load, as well as the interaction 
between motion repetition and external load, had significant effects on 
discomfort. Joint motion and external load significantly affected the RULA grand 
score, whereas all three independent variables affected the LEBA score. This 
finding may indicate that LEBA more accurately reflects the effect of repetitive 
body part movements. Additionally, the scoring systems for repetitive back 
motions by quick exposure check (QEC) and for repetitive wrist motions via a 
risk assessment and management tool for manual handling proactively II (RAMP II) 
may be reasonable based on the results of this study. The findings of this study 
can be used as reference information for better evaluation of postural loads 
assessed using the existing observational techniques, and as useful baseline 
data for the development of a new observational method to accurately assess 
stress caused by repetitive movements.

Snapping phenomena result from the sudden impingement between anatomical and/or 
heterotopical structures with subsequent abrupt movement and noise. Snaps are 
variously perceived by patients, from mild discomfort to significant pain 
requiring surgical management. Identifying the precise cause of snaps may be 
challenging when no abnormality is encountered on routinely performed static 
examinations. In this regard, dynamic imaging techniques have been developed 
over time, with various degrees of success. This review encompasses the main 
features of each imaging technique and proposes an overview of the main snapping 
phenomena in the musculoskeletal system.

Rotationplasty can be used as an alternative to amputation when conservative 
treatment is not possible, for example in malignant tumours of the knee. The 
principle of the operation is to rotate the lower leg through 180 ° after 
resection of the distal femur and in this way the ankle joint replaces the knee 
joint. This surgical technique, although complex, allows satisfactory 
carcinological resection with a functional outcome superior to amputation above 
the knee as well as a better quality-of-life. Patients do not develop phantom 
pain, neuroma or stump discomfort because it is not an amputation. In addition, 
they can actively control their knee and having proprioception and normal 
contact with the ground. This results in a coordinated, harmonious and elegant 
gait pattern similar to the normal population. Patients are more efficient in 
their activities of everyday life and sports. The major disadvantage is the 
particular aesthetic aspect and the psychological acceptance.

distal et, ainsi, l’articulation de la cheville remplace l’articulation du 
genou. Cette technique chirurgicale, bien que complexe, permet une exérèse 
carcinologique satisfaisante, avec un résultat fonctionnel supérieur à celui de 
l’amputation au-dessus du genou, ainsi qu’une meilleure qualité de vie. En 
effet, les patients ne développent pas de douleurs fantômes, névromes ou gêne du 
moignon puisqu’il ne s’agit pas d’une amputation. De plus, ils peuvent contrôler 
activement leur genou et gardent une proprioception et une sensation d’un 
contact normal avec le sol. Il en résulte un schéma de démarche coordonné, 
harmonieux et élégant, similaire à la population normale. Les patients sont plus 
performants dans leurs activités quotidiennes et sportives. L’inconvénient 
majeur est l’acceptation psychologique de cet aspect esthétique particulier.

OBJECTIVE: Various surgical techniques have been reported in treating calcaneal 
malunions over the decades, while the operations on single plane were 
accompanied by respective limitations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
the efficacy of a novel multiple reconstructive osteotomy for treating malunited 
calcaneal fractures without subtalar joint fusion.
METHODS: From March 12, 2010, to August 17, 2017, 10 patients (10 feet) with 
malunited calcaneal fractures were treated with multiple reconstructive 
osteotomy with subtalar joint-preserving operations. All patients were treated 
with a corrective osteotomy, joint realignment, soft tissue balancing, and 
secondary internal fixation at a mean of 5.6 ± 2.41 months since the initial 
injury. With the utilization of the multiple reconstructive osteotomy, the 
posterior facet was restored to preserve the subtalar joint. All patients were 
evaluated clinically and radiographically at a mean follow-up of 
3.04 ± 1.21 years.
RESULTS: All patients were subjectively satisfied with the treatment. The 
average time to union was 12.2 ± 1.11 weeks. The American Orthopedic Foot and 
Ankle (AOFAS) ankle and hind foot score was 86.3 ± 4.45 (t = 27.64, P < 0.0001, 
paired t-test), which was significantly higher than the preoperative assessment. 
Postoperative radiographic assessment revealed great improvement in Böhler's 
angle (from 25.4° to 86.3°), talocalcaneal height (65.15-72.68 mm) and 
Calcaneus-talus angle (from 34.46° to 39.7°). One patient had mild discomfort 
after a 1-h brisk walk. One patient was suspected to have early posttraumatic 
arthritis of the subtalar joint based upon radiographic evidence during the 
follow-up, but the patients could walk normally for a long time without pain.
CONCLUSION: Multiple reconstructive osteotomy is an effective way to restore the 
calcaneal morphology and preserve the subtalar joint for selected calcaneal 
malunion.

INTRODUCTION: The age of menopause is a time of many changes in the 
psychophysical-social functioning of women, with reduced ovarian hormonal 
activity and estrogen levels. The most common, troublesome symptoms of menopause 
age include depressive disorders, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, 
discomfort associated with muscle pain, joint aches, osteoporosis and 
characteristic hot flashes.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Aim of the study is to determine and compare the rate of 
menopausal symptoms among women living in continents of both Americas, Africa, 
Australia and Eurasia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of this work were obtained in 2014 on the 
basis of the data from a review of the 64 most important studies using the 
PubMed database. Research published in the period 2000-2014, from Africa, both 
Americas, Australia and Eurasia, were taken into account.
RESULTS: The prevalence of menopausal symptoms in African women is 
disconcertingly high. Women from South America complain about occurrence of 
depressive, sexual dysfunctions and discomfort associated with muscle pain and 
joint aches. Symptoms most reported by women in the United States are pains 
associated with muscles and joints. Women in Australia suffer mainly due to 
vasomotor symptoms and sexual dysfunction, while in the group of women surveyed 
in Asia there is observed an alarming increase in the proportion of women 
reporting depressive disorders. In Europe there was a much greater incidence of 
sleep disorders and depressive disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Women around the world suffer from ailments characteristic for the 
menopausal period regardless of ethnic origin, skin color or socio-demographic 
factors.

Inflammation and hypertrophy of the ankle joint's synovial lining can occur due 
to various causes. Chronic pain and degenerative changes may be due to synovitis 
causing clinical manifestations through traction on the joint capsule. The 
failure of conservative treatment for at least six months indicates arthroscopic 
debridement, which can provide significant pain relief without the morbidity of 
extensive surgical exposures. This study was therefore conducted to establish 
the functional results of arthroscopic debridement of the ankle joint in 
synovitis. Fifteen patients with chronic ankle pain who had not responded to 
conservative treatment for approximately six months were included in the study. 
Arthroscopic debridement was performed using a shaver blade, followed by a 
postoperative ankle physiotherapy regimen. Patients were assessed preoperatively 
and postoperatively using the AOFAS, FADI, and VAS scores, with a mean follow-up 
period of 26 months. There was a significant improvement in the final clinical 
outcomes of the patients. The post-operative VAS score improved to 2.20±0.56 
(2-4) (p-value=0.001), the AOFAS score was 86±8.25 (65-98) (p-value-0.001), and 
the FADI Score was 86.93±7.35(70-96) (p-value=0.001). Thirteen patients (86.67%) 
achieved outstanding or good results, while two had fair results, according to 
Meislin's criterion. One patient reported a superficial wound infection, which 
subsided with antibiotic therapy. The study findings indicate that arthroscopic 
ankle debridement is an efficient method to treat persistent ankle discomfort 
induced by synovitis, and it has a low postsurgical complications rate, quicker 
recovery, and less joint stiffness.

BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is painful condition of 
facial musculoskeletal system. Arthrocentesis is less invasive treatment of TMJ 
dysfunctions. It has been used to treat variety of TMJ disorders. The objective 
of this study was to determine the success of arthrocentesis in TMJPDS patients 
where conservative treatment had failed.
METHODS: This descriptive case study of 45 patients was completed in 6 months at 
Outpatient Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Mayo hospital Lahore. 
TMJPDS Patients who were unresponsive to conservative treatment were included in 
this study. The study consisted of a single arthrocentesis procedure performed 
by a single oral surgeon per patient. Visual Analogue Scale was used to record 
pain while maximum mouth opening was measured by the interincisal distance in 
millimetres, at 1 month and 2 months after the treatment. Success was measured 
two months after arthrocentesis.
RESULTS: Thirty (66.7%) patients had no pain and 15 (33.3%) patients had mild 
pain. Similarly, 16 (35.5%) patients had maximum mouth opening more than 30mm 
and 29 (64.5%) patients had less than 30 mm mouth opening, two months after 
arthrocentesis procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthrocentesis is very effective in patients suffering from TMPDS 
by reducing pain and discomfort and increase in mouth opening. This procedure 
should be considered in TMPDS patients who do not respond to conservative 
treatment.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of gender and postures 
of the neck, trunk, and knee on overall postural discomfort, and to classify 
combined postures into different postural discomfort groups. A total of 95 
participants (42 males and 53 females) performed 45 different static postures, 
which were a combination of 3 neck angles, 5 trunk angles, and 3 knee angles, 
and rated the perceived postural discomfort. Non-hierarchical K-means cluster 
analysis was employed to classify the 45 different combined postures into 
several postural discomfort groups. Postural discomfort was significantly 
affected by gender and postures of the neck, trunk, and knee (p < 0.001). Three 
clusters (high, medium, and low discomfort) were identified and the postural 
discomfort was significantly different between clusters (p < 0.001). The high 
discomfort group consisted of mostly males with high knee and trunk flexion 
angles and a moderate neck flexion angle. The low discomfort group was 
female-dominant with low neck and trunk flexion angles and a moderate knee 
flexion angle. The different flexibility (stiffness) of the joint motions 
between genders may affect the gender difference in postural discomfort. The 
knee and trunk postures were critical to the postural balance, which may affect 
the perception of whole-body discomfort. This result will be useful for 
developing and improving postural observation tools.

Sugar-borates (SBs) are mono- or di-sugar-borate esters (SBEs) comprised of one 
or two monosaccharide molecules linked to a boron (B) atom. SBEs occur naturally 
in commonly consumed herbs, vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts and, other than 
greatly varying levels of B found in local drinking water, are the primary 
natural dietary sources of B-containing molecules in humans. To date, the most 
studied SBE is calcium fructoborate (CaFB). CaFB represents an important example 
of how organic B-containing molecules are significantly distinct from their 
inorganic counterparts. During these past two decades, CaFB has been researched 
for its physical and biochemical characteristics, safety, and clinical outcomes. 
Results of these researches are presented and discussed herein. CaFB has been 
characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), high-performance thin-layer chromatography 
(HPTLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid chromatography-multistage 
accurate mass spectrometry (LC-MSn), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman 
spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) in non-biological and 
biological specimens. Potential health benefits of CaFB have been clinically 
investigated in pilot and efficacy studies demonstrating (i) significant 
reductions in knee discomfort and improved flexibility within 7, 14, and 90 days 
and (ii) significant effect on blood levels of inflammatory, cardiovascular, and 
other biomarkers. These studies support the use of CaFB as a dietary supplement 
for the management of joint discomfort. CaFB is presented here in order to 
illustrate how physiological benefits are imparted by distinct organic 
boron-containing molecules rather than solely by the element B itself. 
Considering recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
data reporting increases in age-related joint pain and an increasing elderly 
demographic, SBEs offer potential for safe, natural, and effective management of 
joint discomfort and improved mobility in human and animal health applications. 
Several of these studies may also open new opportunities for use of SBEs for 
health benefits beyond joint health.

Trapeziectomy is performed for trapeziometacarpal (TMC) arthritis but decreased 
lateral pinch strength is a major source of discomfort after the surgery. The 
magnitude of the decrease is unclear, however, and how the pressure changes in 
the TMC joint is unknown. To investigate this relationship, we designed a 
cadaveric study to measure TMC joint pressure using a lateral pinch model, and 
quantitatively evaluated the effect of trapeziectomy on the pressure 
measurements. For 10 cadaveric forearms, physiologic forces were applied across 
the thumb TMC joint by loading five tendons, thereby simulating lateral pinch. 
Using pressure sensors, we measured the lateral pinch pressure and TMC joint 
pressure, which averaged 10.1 (range, 4.2-16.2) kg/cm2 and 2.0 (range, 0.8-4.4) 
kg/cm2 , respectively. A significant correlation between the measurements was 
found, with an average ratio of 19% (range, 10%-27%). After trapeziectomy and 
interposition of the tendon ball using flexor carpi radialis, the pressure 
measurements were repeated under the same conditions. Significant changes were 
found, which averaged 5.1 (range, 1.7-10.7) kg/cm2 for lateral pinch pressure 
and 15.0 (range, 5.6-25.6) kg/cm2 for TMC joint pressure. In conclusion, TMC 
joint pressure could be measured as the ratio relative to lateral pinch pressure 
using a cadaveric model. After trapeziectomy, the lateral pinch strength 
decreased, whereas the TMC joint pressure increased.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of axial traction during MR arthrography (MRA) 
of the elbow joint on joint space widening, contrast dispersion between opposing 
cartilage surfaces and cartilage surface visibility.
METHODS: 11 patients with elbow MRA with and without axial traction were 
prospectively studied. Two radiologists independently measured the elbow joint 
space width and semi-quantitatively graded contrast material dispersion between 
the opposing cartilage surfaces as well as the articular cartilage surface 
visibility before and after traction. The detection and visibility of articular 
cartilage defects were also compared before and after traction. Patients were 
instructed to report on pain or any other symptoms during elbow traction.
RESULTS: No patient reported discomfort, pain or any other symptoms related to 
traction on immediate and intermediate-term follow-up. Joint space width 
increased, more at the radiocapitellar joint space (Δ = 0.63 mm, p = 0.005) than 
at the ulnotrochlear joint space (Δ = 0.17 mm, p = 0.012), with contrast 
dispersion into the radiocapitellar joint and cartilage visibility of the 
radiocapitellar joint space significantly improving after traction (all 
p < 0.05). All of these parameters also improved at the ulnotrochlear joint, 
although this did not reach statistical significance. Traction improved the 
visibility of cartilage defects.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the effect of traction on MRA of 
the elbow joint. This technique is safe and technically feasible. Traction MRA 
improves the cartilage surface visibility and cartilage defect visibility.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This technique is safe and technically feasible. Traction 
MRA improves cartilage surface visibility and cartilage defect visibility.

BACKGROUND: Chronic cervical facet joint pain is a leading cause of pain and 
disability. In patients nonresponsive to conservative treatment, cervical facet 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has shown to be efficacious. However, the 
conventional RFA technique can be cumbersome. A novel RFA technique with a 
multitined cannula allows for a lateral approach and represents an attractive 
alternative option for cervical facet RFA. It offers a potentially shorter, less 
cumbersome procedure, with consequently less x-ray exposure and patient 
discomfort than the conventional cervical RFA.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the novel RFA technique using the lateral approach with 
the multitined cannula at the cervical facet joints and to assess its efficacy 
in chronic cervical facet joint pain.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center observational study.
SETTING: Interventional Pain Management Center, Switzerland.
METHODS: The aim of this study is to describe the RFA technique using the 
lateral approach with the multitined cannula at the cervical facet joints and to 
assess its efficacy in chronic cervical facet joint pain. Eligible adult 
patients with chronic (> 3 months) cervical facet joint pain refractory to 
conservative treatment and confirmed by dual positive medial branch blocks, 
received a fluoroscopic-guided cervical facet RFA treatment using the multitined 
cannula. The primary outcome was pain relief. Secondary outcome measures 
included the proportion of patients reporting a >= 30% reduction of pain 
intensity 2 months after RFA, patient global impression of change (PGIC), need 
for pain medication, sleep quality, and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: We included 26 patients. The patients showed a clinically meaningful 
and significant pain relief at 2 months after cervical facet RFA (mean Numeric 
Rating Scale of 7.5 [1.9] at baseline to 4.2 [2.4]) and 58% of the patients 
reported >= 30% reduction of pain. An improvement on the PGIC was reported by 
88.2% of the patients. No severe side effects or complications were observed.
LIMITATIONS: Key limitations of our study were the relatively small sample size, 
the lack of a control group, and a relatively short-term follow-up duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cervical facet joint RFA using the novel 
technique with the multitined cannula results in significant pain reduction and 
improvement on the PGIC. While the conventional technique requires multiple 
ablations at each target level, the RFA with the multitined needle requires only 
a singular ablation, likely sparing time, radiation dose, discomfort, and costs. 
Our results merit consideration of replacement of the conventional technique 
with the novel technique using the multitined cannula. However, larger-scale 
clinical trials with an adequate long-term follow-up period are needed to prove 
the efficacy of RFA using the multitined cannula in cervical facet joint pain.

Dentists are at high risk for musculoskeletal disorders (MSD's) due to their 
work. MSD's is an umbrella term for number of injuries affecting different parts 
of the body, including joints, muscles, tendons, nerves that can arise from 
sudden exertion or making the same motions repeatedly. These injuries can 
develop over time and can lead to long-term disability. Dental professional 
often develop musculoskeletal problems due to bad working habits, uncomfortable 
physical posture causing unnecessary musculoskeletal loading, discomfort and 
fatigue. Ergonomic principles when it is applied, it will help to reduce stress 
and eliminate many potential injuries and disorders associated with the overuse 
of muscles, bad posture, and repeated tasks. This can be accomplished by using a 
proper dental chair, lighting and the selection of ergonomically-friendly 
equipment to fit the dental professionals physical capabilities and limitations. 
This review addresses about the basics of ergonomics, positioning, viewing, 
handling, and prevention of MSD's.

The number of individuals who experience the symptoms of gonarthrosis rises 
proportionally as life expectancy rises and the population becomes more active. 
The purpose of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to lessen pain and restore knee 
function, and it has a high success rate. The restoration of patellar tracking 
in addition to the proper alignment of the femoral and tibial components 
contributes to the success of the arthroplasty and the patient's happiness. 
Replacement of the knee is not an easy process. One of the major objectives of 
total knee replacement is to achieve the proper rotation of the femoral 
components. A critical step that affects postoperative outcomes in total knee 
arthroplasty is the correct alignment of the femoral component. The axial plane 
of the femoral component is to blame for flexion stability, knee joint 
kinematics, flexion alignment, and patellar tracking. The patella is the largest 
sesamoid bone in the human body, and its major role is to enhance the 
quadriceps' moment arm, which allows the knee to expand. The distribution of 
patellofemoral compressive pressures during knee flexion and the centralization 
of the quadriceps muscles' multidirectional pull during extension are both 
critical functions of the patella. After primary knee arthroplasty, there are 8% 
more cases of anterior knee discomfort than there were before. Whether or not 
the patella was resurfaced, patients with primary TKA experience anterior knee 
discomfort. Patella baja is caused by excessive joint line elevation, which 
causes persistent overload and discomfort. The design of the TKR might have an 
impact on postoperative patellofemoral problems. After TKR, patellofemoral 
maltracking and patellar dislocation are often caused by surgical mistakes.

Osteoarthritis of the knee is a prevalent condition that causes pain, 
discomfort, and disability that can severely impact the quality of life. This 
literature review aims to review the various interventional pain management 
techniques available to treat knee osteoarthritis. It analyzes the efficacy of 
various interventions such as intra-articular corticosteroids, prolotherapy, 
viscosupplementation, platelet-rich plasma, and genicular nerve blocks with 
radiofrequency ablation or cryoneurolysis. We searched databases for studies 
published in the past 20 years. A total of 37 articles were included. The 
literature supports the idea that a comprehensive treatment plan consisting of 
the various aforementioned techniques can provide relief for patients while 
delaying or avoiding joint replacement surgery.

A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to 
evaluate the chondroprotective action of salmon nasal cartilage proteoglycan on 
joint health. The effect of oral administration of proteoglycan (10 mg/day) on 
cartilage metabolism was evaluated in individuals with knee joint discomfort but 
without diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. The average age of patients was 
52.6±1.1 years old. The effect of proteoglycan was evaluated by analyzing 
markers for type II collagen degradation (C1,2C) and synthesis (PIICP), and the 
ratio of type II collagen degradation to synthesis. The results indicated that 
the change in C1,2C levels significantly differed in the proteoglycan group 
compared with the placebo group following 16 weeks intervention among subjects 
with high levels of knee pain and physical dysfunction (total score of Japan 
Knee Osteoarthritis Measure ≥41) and subjects with constant knee pain (both 
P<0.05). There was a greater increase in PIICP levels in the proteoglycan group 
than the placebo group following intervention, although this difference was not 
significant in both sets of patients. Thus, the C1,2C/PIICP ratios decreased in 
the proteoglycan group, whereas they slightly increased in the placebo group 
following the intervention. Furthermore, no test supplement-related adverse 
events were observed during the intervention. Therefore, oral administration of 
salmon nasal cartilage proteoglycan at a dose of 10 mg/day may exert a 
chondroprotective action in subjects with knee joint discomfort. This effect was 
achieved by improving cartilage metabolism (reducing type II collagen 
degradation and enhancing type II collagen synthesis), without causing apparent 
adverse effects.

A trunk-twisting posture is strongly associated with physical discomfort. 
Measurement of joint kinematics to assess physical exposure to injuries is 
important. However, using a single Kinect sensor to track the upper-limb joint 
angle trajectories during twisting tasks in the workplace is challenging due to 
sensor view occlusions. This study provides and validates a simple method to 
optimally select the upper-limb joint angle data from two Kinect sensors at 
different viewing angles during the twisting task, so the errors of trajectory 
estimation can be improved. Twelve healthy participants performed a rightward 
twisting task. The tracking errors of the upper-limb joint angle trajectories of 
two Kinect sensors during the twisting task were estimated based on concurrent 
data collected using a conventional motion tracking system. The error values 
were applied to generate the error trendlines of two Kinect sensors using 
third-order polynomial regressions. The intersections between two error 
trendlines were used to define the optimal data selection points for data 
integration. The finding indicates that integrating the outputs from two Kinect 
sensor datasets using the proposed method can be more robust than using a single 
sensor for upper-limb joint angle trajectory estimations during the twisting 
task.

Estimating human motion intention, such as intent joint torque and movement, 
plays a crucial role in assistive robotics for ensuring efficient and safe 
human-robot interaction. For coupled human-robot systems, surface 
electromyography (sEMG) signal has been proven as an effective means for 
estimating human's intended movements. Usually, joint movement estimation uses 
sEMG signals measured from multiple muscles and needs many sEMG sensors placed 
on the human body, which may cause discomfort or result in mechanical/signal 
interference from wearable robots/environment during long-term routine use. 
Although the muscle synergy principle implies that it is possible to estimate 
human motion using sEMG signals from even one signal muscle, few studies 
investigated the feasibility of continuous motion estimation based on 
single-channel sEMG. In this study, a feature-guided convolutional neural 
network (FG-CNN) has been proposed to estimate human knee joint movement using 
single-channel sEMG. In the proposed FG-CNN, several handcrafted features have 
been fused into a CNN model to guide CNN feature extraction, and both 
handcrafted and CNN-extracted features were applied to a regression model, i.e., 
random forest regression, to estimate knee joint movements. Experiments with 8 
healthy subjects were carried out, and sEMG signals measured from 6 muscles, 
i.e., vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, lateral 
or medial gastrocnemius (LG or MG), were separately evaluated for knee joint 
estimation using the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that 
the proposed FG-CNN method with single-channel sEMG signals from LG or MG can 
effectively estimate human knee joint movements. The average correlation 
coefficient between the measured and the estimated knee joint movements is 0.858 
± 0.085 for LG and 0.856 ± 0.057 for MG. Meanwhile, comparative studies showed 
that the combined handcrafted-CNN features outperform either the handcrafted 
features or the CNN features; the performance of the proposed signal-channel 
sEMG-based FG-CNN method is comparable to those of the traditional multi-channel 
sEMG-based methods. The outcomes of this study enable the possibility of 
developing a single-channel sEMG-based human-robot interface for knee joint 
movement estimation, which can facilitate the routine use of assistive robots.

Gout is an arthritic syndrome that causes extensive joint damage and discomfort. 
It is due to an elevated uric acid level in the blood which deposits in the 
joints. This causes an inflammatory response and joint damage. Gout typically 
presents as an acute monoarticular attack, resulting in hot, erythematous, 
swollen, and exquisitely tender joint. Tophaceous gout, which is commonly a 
later complication of long-standing gout, can rarely be the presenting 
manifestation of gout. Tophaceous gout is considered a late complication of 
chronic gout. As early recognition of gout can lead to prompt initiation of 
treatment and improvement in clinical status, a patient with an alcohol use 
history who presents with polyarticular swelling and tenderness should raise the 
suspicion of a tophaceous gout exacerbation even if the patient does not have a 
documented history of gout.

Joint contracture leads to major patient discomfort. Metformin, one of the most 
extensively used oral drugs against type 2 diabetes has recently been found to 
suppress tissue fibrosis as well. However, its role in suppressing tissue 
fibrosis in joint contractures remains unknown. In this study, we examined the 
role of metformin treatment in suppressing joint capsular fibrosis and the most 
effective time of its administration. Joint capsular fibrosis was induced by 
immobilizing the knee joints of mice using splints and tapes. Metformin was 
administered intraperitoneally every alternate day after immobilization. 
Histological and immunohistochemical changes and expression of fibrosis-related 
genes were evaluated. Metformin treatment significantly suppressed fibrosis in 
joint capsules based on histological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Joint 
capsular tissue from metformin-treated mice also showed decreased expression of 
fibrosis-related genes. Early, but not late, metformin administration showed the 
same effect on fibrosis suppression in joint capsule as the whole treatment 
period. The expression of fibrosis-related genes was most suppressed in mice 
administered with metformin early. These studies demonstrated that metformin 
treatment can suppress joint capsular fibrosis and the most effective time to 
administer it is early after joint immobilization; a delay of more than 2 weeks 
of administration is less effective.

BACKGROUND: Total contact casts (TCCs) are used to immobilize and unload the 
foot and ankle for the rehabilitation of ankle fractures and for the management 
of diabetic foot complications. The kinematic restrictions imposed by TCCs to 
the foot and ankle also change knee and hip kinematics, however, these changes 
have not been quantified before. High joint loading is associated with 
discomfort and increased risk for injuries. To assess joint loading, the effect 
of the muscle forces acting on each joint must also be considered. This 
challenge can be overcome with the help of musculoskeletal modelling.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How does a TCC affect lower extremity joint loading?
METHODS: Twelve healthy participants performed gait trials with and without a 
TCC. Kinematic and kinetic recordings served as input to subject-specific 
musculoskeletal models that enabled the computation of joint angles and loading. 
Cast-leg interaction was modelled by means of reaction forces between a rigid, 
zero-mass cast segment and the segments of the lower extremity.
RESULTS: and Significance: Reduced ankle, knee and hip range of motion was 
observed for the TCC condition. Statistical parametric mapping indicated 
decreased hip abduction and flexion moments during initial contact with the TCC. 
The anterior knee force was significantly decreased during the mid and terminal 
stance and the second peak of the compressive knee force was significantly 
reduced for the TCC. As expected, the TCC resulted in significantly reduced 
ankle loading.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to quantify the effect of a TCC on lower 
limb joint loading. Its results demonstrate the efficiency of a TCC in unloading 
the ankle joint complex without increasing the peak loads on knee and hip. 
Future studies should investigate whether the observed knee and hip kinematic 
and kinetic differences could lead to discomfort.

Adelaide, Australia.

Dry arthroscopy is attractive because it affords an unsurpassed clarity of view 
and minimizes swelling. The elbow is a challenging joint to assess 
arthroscopically; however, dry arthroscopy has some particular benefits in the 
elbow. The primary benefit is the quality of the tissue definition, but dry 
arthroscopy also increases the working time for surgery by reducing swelling and 
results in less postoperative discomfort for the patient. With dry arthroscopy, 
all joint surfaces are covered in synovial fluid, which reflects light, to 
provide a clearer image of the joint surfaces and depth of field. The air-fluid 
interface provides an uninterrupted appreciation of the synovial recesses and 
tissue perfusion. This article describes the technique and indications for dry 
elbow arthroscopy, which will allow other surgeons to reap the benefits of dry 
arthroscopy without the need for special equipment or changes in their basic 
technique.

The primary posterior stabilizer of the knee is the posterior cruciate ligament 
(PCL), the largest intra-articular ligament in the human knee. One of the four 
primary ligaments of the knee joint, the PCL, serves to support the tibia on the 
femur. An extreme force applied anteriorly to the proximal tibia of the flexed 
knee results in trauma to the PCL. Dashboard injuries, which occur when the knee 
is driven into the dashboard after a collision with a motor vehicle, are 
frequent causes. Grade 1 and 2 acute injuries are often addressed conservatively 
due to the PCL's natural capacity for mending. If a grade 3 injury occurs, a 
cautious trial can be conducted on elderly or low-demand patients. When standard 
treatment for isolated grade 3 injuries has failed, surgery is advised. 
Single-bundle or double-bundle techniques using either transtibial tunnel or 
tibial inlay techniques are among the reconstruction approaches. Restoring the 
natural kinematics of the knee and forestalling persistent posterior and mixed 
rotatory knee laxity are the ultimate goals of treating PCL injuries through a 
personalized strategy. These injuries may become more common in the future as 
more people participate in sports. As a result of ongoing instability, 
discomfort, diminished function, and the emergence of inflammatory and 
degenerative disorders of joints, PCL rips are becoming more well-acknowledged 
as a cause of morbidity and decreased function.

A 49-year-old man with no prior history of trauma, steroid use, or alcohol 
consumption presented with spontaneously developing progressive left knee 
discomfort that worsened after intense activity for 1.5 years. Normal x-rays 
indicated local discomfort along the joint line, and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) revealed a T1-weighted hypointense line with bone infarcts in the medial 
and lateral condyle and the lower part of the left femur in addition to 
diffuse bone edema. Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) was identified. 
Initially, he was treated conservatively with painkillers and calcium 
supplements. Then, the patient showed a significant improvement.

The symptomatic degenerative meniscus continues to be a source of discomfort for 
a significant number of patients. With vascular penetration of less than 
one-third of the adult meniscus, healing potential in the setting of chronic 
degeneration remains low. Continued hoop and shear stresses upon the 
degenerative meniscus results in gross failure, often in the form of complex 
tears in the posterior horn and midbody. Patient history and physical 
examination are critical to determine the true source of pain, particularly with 
the significant incidence of simultaneous articular pathology. Joint line 
tenderness, a positive McMurray test, and mechanical catching or locking can be 
highly suggestive of a meniscal source of knee pain and dysfunction. Radiographs 
and magnetic resonance imaging are frequently utilized to examine for 
osteoarthritis and to verify the presence of meniscal tears, in addition to 
ruling out other sources of pain. Non-operative therapy focused on non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy may be able to provide pain relief 
as well as improve mechanical function of the knee joint. For patients 
refractory to conservative therapy, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy can 
provide short-term gains regarding pain relief, especially when combined with an 
effective, regular physiotherapy program. Patients with clear mechanical 
symptoms and meniscal pathology may benefit from arthroscopic partial 
meniscectomy, but surgery is not a guaranteed success, especially with 
concomitant articular pathology. Ultimately, the long-term outcomes of either 
treatment arm provide similar results for most patients. Further study is needed 
regarding the short and long-term outcomes regarding conservative and surgical 
therapy, with a particular focus on the economic impact of treatment as well.

Septic arthritis is a debilitating, inflammatory condition of joints that can 
cause patients to experience significant pain and discomfort. An estimated 
0.006% of people annually develop the condition; the absence of prompt diagnosis 
and treatment can lead to long-term joint dysfunction. Septic arthritis is 
usually caused by hematologic seeding of the joint space by bacteria, however, 
those who receive intra-joint injections and IV access are also at high risk for 
developing the condition. In this article, we present the case of a 58-year-old 
male with no immediately identifiable risk factors for septic arthritis, who was 
found to have a septic joint as a result of an invading perirectal abscess that 
was discovered in an imaging study.

Discomfort and stiffness in the shoulder joint are the main causes of a frozen 
shoulder. The main contributing factor to frozen shoulder is typically co-morbid 
disorders like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Adhesive capsulitis is 
another name for a frozen shoulder. Range of motion is the main aspect that is 
targeted when the illness slowly worsens. The three stages of a frozen shoulder 
are the freezing stage, the frozen stage, and the thawing stage. Physical 
therapy plays an important role in providing relief for this condition, but the 
usual conservative management is more time-consuming, so a patient with a frozen 
shoulder is managed along with Gong's mobilization and the usual conservative 
management is given for two weeks. This case report aims to show the result of 
Gong's mobilization in two weeks. Further, in this case report, the proper 
procedure for the Gong's mobilization is explained.

INTRODUCTION: Several methods treating proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) 
fracture dislocations have been established providing early joint mobilization. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcome of 
unstable fracture dislocations of the PIP treated with a parabolic dynamic 
external fixator consisting of two Kirschner (K)-wires.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients who sustained a pilonoidal fracture 
of the PIP joint and were treated with a dynamic external fixator were evaluated 
retrospectively. The active range of motion, pain level, DASH score, Buck 
Gramcko Score, and the patient's satisfaction and acceptance were assessed. 
X-ray images were evaluated for bone healing, joint alignment, and signs of 
osteoarthritis.
RESULTS: Mean PIP joint range of motion was 76°. Patients showed very mild 
discomfort (mean 0.7), high patient satisfaction (mean 1.9), and a moderate 
acceptance (mean 2.7). The mean DASH score was 11.6 and the Buck Gramcko score 
13. All patients showed bone healing. One patient suffered from a recurrent 
dislocation, and another a subluxation of the PIP joint while wearing the 
fixator. Both joints could be corrected by modifying the fixator under image 
intensifier. Twenty patients (95%) showed a concentric and stable aligned joint. 
Three patients showed an osteoarthritis stage 0, five stage 1, nine stage 2, 
three stage 3, and one stage 4 according to the Kellgran-Lawrence Score.
CONCLUSION: The use of a parabolic dynamic external fixator constructed from two 
K-wires restores joint alignment and stability in unstable pilonoidal PIP joint 
disclocation fractures. It allows immediate PIP joint mobilization to avoid 
adhesions. Modifications of the radius of the parabolic construct within cases 
of postoperative malalignment, without anesthesia, can restore joint axis and 
malalignment. This fixator is a cost-effective alternative, showing a good 
clinical outcome.

Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.

BACKGROUND: Although ultrasound (US)-guided injection techniques for magnetic 
resonance arthrography of the hip have been used with increasing frequency to 
diagnose internal joint derangements, little is known about patient tolerance, 
which is relevant information for patients. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate prospectively the association between possible influencing factors and 
discomfort felt during the performance of anterior US-guided injection 
techniques targeting the femoral head-neck junction during hip arthrography.
METHODS: Forty-four consecutive patients (21 women and 23 men; mean age, 41 
years) undergoing magnetic resonance hip arthrography were sequentially assigned 
to receive injection alternating between fixed and freehand US-guided injection. 
Discomfort was assessed using a visual analog scale and relative ratings. 
Patient body mass index, extra-articular contrast leakage, the duration of the 
procedure, the needle advancement distance, and the fixed trajectory of the 
needle were assessed. Pearson's correlation coefficients and multiple logistic 
regression analysis were used to determine the association.
RESULTS: Puncture was successfully accomplished in all cases, and no relevant 
complications were reported. The only significant relationships were between 
discomfort and the time required for needle manipulation (r = 0.8) and fixed 
US-guided injection (r = 0.6; p < 0.001). Compared with the freehand technique, 
the fixed technique resulted in significantly less pain and took significantly 
less time to perform (p < 0.001). The procedure time during needle manipulation 
in the fixed US-guided injections (4.0 ± 0.9 seconds) was significantly less 
than that in the freehand US-guided injections (19.4 ± 17.6 seconds; p < 0.001). 
No significant relationships were found between discomfort and other parameters 
(r < 0.3, p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The procedure time appears to be the most important factor 
influencing patient discomfort. Fixed US-guided injection is a time-saving 
technique that alleviates procedure-related discomfort.

INTRODUCTION: Many loose bodies are present in the joint due to the uncommon 
benign neoplastic disorder known as synovial chondromatosis, which causes the 
production of intra-articular nodular cartilaginous lesions from the synovium. 
Synovial chondromatosis of the ankle joint is an uncommon condition. Here, we 
present a case of synovial chondromatosis of the ankle joint treated by surgical 
excision.
CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old woman who had been experiencing discomfort and edema 
in her left ankle for 8 years and had gotten worse during the previous 2 years 
visited our outpatient department. Clinical and radiological examination 
revealed synovial chondromatosis of the left ankle joint.
CONCLUSION: Synovial chondromatosis of the ankle is an uncommon synovial 
neoplasm in an unlikely anatomic location. The diagnosis should be considered 
when evaluating monoarticular synovitis.

This study aimed to determine the intra-day reliability, individuals performance 
expectancy, and biomechanical response of nine stretching instructions in 
assessing the maximal range of motion (mROM) during the passive ankle 
dorsiflexion test. Twenty healthy young participants were tested in two sessions 
within the same day. Nine stretching instructions composed by intensity-domain 
(i.e. minimum, point, and maximum) and sensation-domain (i.e. tolerance, 
discomfort, and pain) words were used to impose plantar flexors stretching. In 
the first session, individuals were requested to order the nine stretching 
instructions in ascending order. The ankle joint torque-angle and medial 
gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior electric activity were assessed in 
both sessions. A moderate to high reliability was observed across instructions 
(ICC = 0.65-0.87). Most stretching instructions showed high intra-day 
reliability outcomes, where discomfort and tolerance showed moderate 
reliability. 70% of individuals performed the stretching maneuvers consistently 
to stretching instructions performance expectancy. A greater torque-angle 
response was observed for the instructions involving the word pain 
(ROM = 40.5 ± 1.6°), compared to discomfort (29.5 ± 1.8°), and tolerance 
(30.5 ± 2.0°) that produced similar stretching intensities. Instructions 
involving the terms minimum (29.6 ± 2.0°), point (33.3 ± 7.6°), and maximum 
(37.6 ± 7.2°) were more discriminative of stretching intensities than 
sensation-domain terms. In conclusion, stretching instructions targeting the 
joint maximal range of motion produce different joint torque-angle responses and 
they may not be understandable by all individuals, although (in general) they 
can be used reliably.

Anterior mandibular dislocation (AMD) is defined as the displacement of the 
condylar head out of the glenoid fossa beyond the articular eminence, and that 
does not reduce spontaneously to its normal position. The Hippocratic method is 
the usual approach for condylar repositioning at most health centers although it 
is perceived by the patient as an unpleasant, brusque technique and outcomes are 
not always favorable.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to describe a new simplified nontraumatic 
manual technique and its application in a series of cases.
METHOD: A procedure based on gently and constantly guiding the patient's mouth 
opening and closing movements is described in detail.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients were treated with a treatment success rate of 100%, 
and no pain associated with the procedure. Procedure time was 1.5-7 min in 40 of 
the 42 treated cases.
CONCLUSION: The procedure presented here is an improvement on the original 
technique: it is simple, fast, effective, can be performed in any setting, and 
avoids use of brusque force, which is the factor that causes the patient most 
discomfort and fear.

AIM: We sought to evaluate musculoskeletal discomfort and mental and physical 
fatigue in the call-center workers of an airline company before and after a 
supervised exercise program compared with rest breaks during the work shift.
INTRODUCTION: This was a longitudinal pilot study conducted in a flight-booking 
call-center for an airline in São Paulo, Brazil. Occupational health activities 
are recommended to decrease the negative effects of the call-center working 
conditions. In practice, exercise programs are commonly recommended for computer 
workers, but their effects have not been studied in call-center operators.
METHODS: Sixty-four call-center operators participated in this study. Thirty-two 
subjects were placed into the experimental group and attended a 10-min daily 
exercise session for 2 months. Conversely, 32 participants were placed into the 
control group and took a 10-min daily rest break during the same period. Each 
subject was evaluated once a week by means of the Corlett-Bishop body map with a 
visual analog discomfort scale and the Chalder fatigue questionnaire.
RESULTS: Musculoskeletal discomfort decreased in both groups, but the reduction 
was only statistically significant for the spine and buttocks (p=0.04) and the 
sum of the segments (p=0.01) in the experimental group. In addition, the 
experimental group showed significant differences in the level of mental 
fatigue, especially in questions related to memory Rienzo, #181ff and tiredness 
(p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrate that appropriately designed and 
supervised exercise programs may be more efficient than rest breaks in 
decreasing discomfort and fatigue levels in call-center operators.

PURPOSE: Thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA) represents a major 
source of functional morbidity. The effects of early CMC OA on loading and use 
patterns potentially lead to changes in local bone density and 
microarchitecture. Hounsfield units (HU), a quantitative attenuation coefficient 
obtained from computed tomography (CT) scans, have been shown to be a reliable 
marker of bone density. We hypothesized that early CMC OA is associated with 
lower local bone density about the CMC joint as assessed by HU.
METHODS: We examined HU units from CT scans in 23 asymptomatic subjects and 91 
patients with early CMC OA. The HU measurements were obtained within cancellous 
portions of the trapezium, capitate, first and third metacarpal bases, and 
distal radius. Linear regression models, with age and sex included as 
covariates, were used to assess the relationship between CMC OA and HU values at 
each anatomical site.
RESULTS: Early OA patients had significantly lower HU than asymptomatic subjects 
within the trapezium (mean, 377 HU vs 436 HU) and first metacarpal bases (265 HU 
vs 324 HU). No significant group differences were noted at the capitate, third 
metacarpal, or distal radius. Male sex and younger age were associated with 
significantly higher HU at all the anatomical sites, except the first metacarpal 
base, where age had no significant effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects presenting with early CMC OA had significantly lower bone 
density as assessed with HU at the thumb CMC joint (trapezium and first 
metacarpal base). Early thumb CMC OA and discomfort may lead to diminished 
loading across the basal joint, producing focal disuse osteopenia. These 
findings in symptomatic early arthritis suggest a relationship between symptoms, 
functional use of the CMC joint, and local bone density.

BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint syndrome, or Costen syndrome, is a 
clinically diagnosed disorder whose most common symptoms include joint pain and 
clicking, difficulty opening the mouth, and temporomandibular joint discomfort. 
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is supplied by the auriculotemporal nerve, a 
collateral branch of the mandibular nerve (the V3 branch of the trigeminal 
nerve).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of 
permanent peripheral nerve stimulation to relieve TMJ pain.
STUDY DESIGN: This case series is a prospective study.
SETTING: Pain Unit of a regional universitary hospital.
METHODS: The study included 6 female patients with temporomandibular pain 
lasting from 2 to 8 years that did not respond to intraarticular local 
anesthetic and corticoid injections. After a positive diagnostic block test, the 
patients were implanted with quadripolar or octapolar leads in the affected 
preauricular region for a 2-week stimulation test phase, after which the leads 
were connected to a permanent implanted pulse generator. Results of the visual 
analog scale, SF-12 Health Survey, Brief Pain Inventory, and drug intake were 
recorded at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the permanent implant.
RESULTS: Five out of 6 patients experienced pain relief exceeding 80% (average 
72%) and received a permanent implant. The SF-12 Health Survey results were very 
positive for all specific questions, especially items concerning the physical 
component. Patients reported returning to normal physical activity and rest at 
night. Four patients discontinued their analgesic medication and 1 patient 
reduced their gabapentin dose by 50%.
LIMITATIONS: Sample size; impossibility of placebo control.
CONCLUSION: Patients affected with TMJ syndrome who do not respond to 
conservative treatments may find a solution in peripheral nerve stimulation, a 
simple technique with a relatively low level of complications.

INTRODUCTION: The primary complaint of patients with hand osteoarthritis (OA) is 
frequently the inelegant appearance of their hands. Only one study has been 
conducted to assess the magnitude of and identify the determinants of aesthetic 
discomfort in hand OA.
METHODS: The LIège Hand Osteoarthritis Cohort is a prospective cohort of 203 
patients diagnosed with hand OA. At baseline, these patients rated their 
aesthetic discomfort on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and used a Likert 
scale (range 0-7) to quantify the magnitude of their aesthetic damage.
RESULTS: The median value of the aesthetic discomfort VAS was 35.0 
[interquartile range (Q1-Q3) 6.0-59.0]. The median damage was rated 3.0 (Q1-Q3 
1.0-4.0), corresponding to a moderate level. Both were significantly (p < 0.02) 
associated with the female gender, the duration of hand OA, the radiological 
severity of OA (Verbruggen-Veys and Kellgren-Lawrence scales) and pain, 
disability, or stiffness [Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN) 
and Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis ]. After a stepwise analysis, the 
parameters correlated to the aesthetic discomfort were the presence of erosive 
joints (p = 0.0048), the AUSCAN score (p < 0.0001), the number of joints with 
severe radiological damage (p = 0.023), and gender (p = 0.0009). For aesthetic 
damage, the parameters associated were AUSCAN score (p < 0.0001), duration of 
hand OA >10 years (p = 0.001), and presence of erosive joints (p < 0.0001). 
Compared with patients with low aesthetic discomfort (VAS ≤33 mm), those with 
the highest discomfort (VAS ≥66 mm) had more erosive OA (p = 0.014), a higher 
Verbruggen and Veys score (p = 0.0039), and a higher AUSCAN score (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Aesthetic discomfort and damage are significant complaints in 
patients with hand OA. The determinants of the magnitude of these are gender, 
radiological severity, duration of hand OA, presence of erosive joints, and 
impact on pain, function, and stiffness as assessed with the AUSCAN.

The aim of this study was to develop a core outcome set of what to measure in 
all future clinical research on hand fractures and joint injuries in adults. 
Phase 1 consisted of steps to identify potential outcome domains through 
systematic review of published studies, and exploration of the patient 
perspective through qualitative research, consisting of 25 semi-structured 
interviews and five focus groups. Phase 2 involved key stakeholder groups 
(patients, hand surgeons, and hand therapists) prioritizing the outcome domains 
via a three-round international Delphi survey, with a final consensus meeting to 
agree the final core outcome set. The systematic review of 160 studies 
identified 74 outcome domains based on the World Health Organization 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Overall, 35 
domains were generated through thematic analysis of the patient interviews and 
focus groups. The domains from these elements were synthesised to develop 37 
outcome domains as the basis of the Delphi survey, with a further four generated 
from participant suggestions in Round 1. The Delphi survey identified 20 outcome 
domains as 'very important' for the core outcome set. At the consensus meeting, 
27 participants from key stakeholder groups selected seven outcomes for the core 
outcome set: pain/discomfort with activity, pain/discomfort with rest, fine hand 
use/dexterity, self-hygiene/personal care, return to usual work/job, range of 
motion, and patient satisfaction with outcome/result. This set of core outcome 
domains is recommended as a minimum to be reported in all clinical research on 
hand fractures and joint injuries in adults. While this establishes what to 
measure, future work will focus on determining how best to measure these 
outcomes. By adopting this patient-centred core outcome set, consistency and 
comparability of studies will be improved, aiding meta-analysis and 
strengthening the evidence base for management of these common and impactful 
injuries.

The extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis and Acacia catechu have been shown in 
previous studies to alleviate joint discomfort, reduce stiffness, and improve 
mobility by reducing the production of proinflammatory molecules over long 
periods of supplementation. The acute effects of intake of these extracts have 
not yet been investigated. Thus, we carried out a 1 week clinical trial to 
examine the extent to which UP446-a natural proprietary blend of S. baicalensis 
and A. catechu (UP446)-decreases knee joint pain, mobility, and biomarkers of 
inflammation in comparison to naproxen. Seventy-nine men and women (40-90 years 
old) diagnosed as having mild to moderate osteoarthritis (OA) consumed either 
500 mg/day of the UP446 supplement or 440 mg/day of naproxen for 1 week in a 
double-blind randomized control trial. Pain, knee range of motion (ROM), and 
overall physical activity were evaluated at the start and at the end of 
treatment. Fasting blood was collected to determine serum interleukins 1β and 6, 
tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and hyaluronic acid. The UP446 
group experienced a significant decrease in perceived pain (P=.009) time 
dependently. Stiffness was significantly reduced by both treatments (P=.002 
UP446, P=.008 naproxen). Significant increases in mean ROM over time (P=.04) 
were found in the UP446 group. These findings suggest that UP446 is effective in 
reducing the physical symptoms associated with knee OA.

PURPOSE: Patient safety errors can arise due to similarity in packaging of 
medications. We aimed to describe the clinical features of patients presenting 
with accidental application of joint pain liniments and gum lotion in the eye 
due to confusion arising from similarity in packaging.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case series with eight consecutive patients 
presenting from December 2020 to August 2021 with history of accidental 
application of joint pain liniments or gum lotion in the eye instead of eye 
drops. All patients underwent visual acuity assessment and slit-lamp examination 
with fluorescein staining of the cornea to look for corneal involvement and was 
reassessed till complete resolution.
RESULTS: Of the eight patients, three were males and five were females. Seven 
had accidentally applied joint pain liniment, while one had applied gum lotion 
into the eye. Five of them had corneal involvement ranging from punctate 
erosions to near-total epithelial defects. Two patients needed referral to a 
tertiary center and hospital admission. Treatment duration ranged from 2 days to 
1 month. Two patients were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights patient safety errors arising from confusion 
of medication due to similar labeling and packaging of different drugs. While 
there was no permanent morbidity, such confusions lead to needless discomfort 
and waste of time, money, and effort for the patient as well as the health-care 
system.

Proteomic signature of Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMD): Toward 
diagnostically predictive biomarkers.

Demerjian GG, Sims AB, Stack BC.

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articulates the mandible with the maxilla. 
Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are dysfunctions of this joint, which 
range from acute to chronic inflammation, trauma and dislocations, developmental 
anomalies and neoplasia. TMD manifest as signs and symptoms that involve the 
surrounding muscles, ligaments, bones, synovial capsule, connective tissue, 
teeth and innervations proximal and distal to this joint. TMD induce proximal 
and distal, chronic and acute, dull or intense pain and discomfort, muscle 
spasm, clicking/popping sounds upon opening and closing of the mouth, and 
chewing or speaking difficulties. The trigeminal cranial nerve V, and its 
branches provide the primary sensory innervation to the TMJ. Our clinical work 
suggests that the auriculotemporal (AT) nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve, 
the largest of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve, plays a critical 
role in TMD sequelae. The AT nerve provides the somatosensory fibers that supply 
the joint, the middle ear, and the temporal region. By projecting fibers toward 
the otic ganglion, the AT nerve establishes an important bridge to the 
sympathetic system. As it courses posteriorly to the condylar head of the TMJ, 
compression, injury or irritation of the AT nerve can lead to significant 
neurologic and neuro-muscular disorders, including Tourette's 
syndrome,Torticolli, gait or balance disorders and Parkinson's disease. Here, we 
propose that a proteomic signature of TMD can be obtained by assessing certain 
biomarkers in local (e.g., synovial fluid at the joint) and distal body fluids 
(e.g., saliva, cerebrospinal fluid), which can aid TMD diagnosis and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 
lorecivivint inhibitors in the treatment of osteoarthritis through 
meta-analysis.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search on lorecivivint inhibitors in 
osteoarthritis was performed using electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, 
Web of Science, and CochraneLibrary up to July 30, 2022. Two reviewers 
independently screened, evaluated, and reviewed the eligible studies. Data 
analysis and processing were carried out using RevMan 5.4 software.
RESULTS: A total of six studies involving 3056 participants were included. 
Meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, lorecivivint 
significantly increased WOMAC discomfort (0.03 mg Week 12) (MD = -0.21, 95% CI 
[-1.94 - 1.53]; P = 0.81), WOMAC function (0.07 mg Week 24) (MD = -1.81, 95% CI 
[-4.74 - 1.12]; P = 0.23) and Joint space width (0.23 mg Week 24) (MD = -1.16, 
95% CI [-3.69 - 1.38]; P = 0.37).
CONCLUSION: A new treatment method combining Wnt pathway modulators with 
intra-articular CLK2/DYRK1A inhibitors could be a promising therapy for treating 
osteoarthritis. Lorecivivint was found to significantly improve WOMAC 
discomfort, WOMAC function, and joint space width in osteoarthritis patients. It 
is anticipated to be a reliable, safe, and effective treatment option for 
osteoarthritis with significant therapeutic utility and potential applications.

BACKGROUND: Joint and connective tissue integrity, comfort and function are 
paramount to optimal performance in exercise, recreational and occupational 
activities. The fruit of Terminalia chebula has been used extensively in various 
traditional health systems for different ailments, with additional preclinical 
and clinical data demonstrating antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a standardized aqueous extract 
of Terminalia chebula fruit (AyuFlex®) dietary supplementation on joint 
mobility, comfort, and functional capacity in healthy overweight subjects.
METHODS: One-hundred and five (105) overweight, apparently healthy male and 
female subjects (35-70 years of age) were pre-screened and randomized to one of 
three groups for 84 days: placebo, AyuFlex1 (250 mg twice daily) or AyuFlex2 
(500 mg twice daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. A 
two-week placebo lead-in period was used to improve data quality/validity. All 
subjects had no knee joint discomfort at rest, but experienced knee joint 
discomfort only with activity/exercise of at least 30 on 100 mm Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS). Primary outcome measures included symptoms of joint health and 
function as measured by modified-Knee Injury & Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score 
(mKOOS) global & modified-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis 
Index (mWOMAC) subscales (discomfort, stiffness and function). Secondary 
outcomes included VAS questionnaires on overall/whole-body joint health, low 
back health, knee mobility, willingness and ability to exercise, 6-min walk test 
for distance and range of motion (ROM) of pain-free knee flexion/extension. 
Tertiary outcome measures included inflammatory (high sensitivity C-reactive 
protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and extracellular matrix 
(ECM)/Connective Tissue (COMP) biomarkers, and safety (vital signs and blood 
markers) & tolerability (Adverse Event (AE)/ side effect profiles).
RESULTS: Compared to placebo, at day 84 AyuFlex® treatment significantly: 1) 
improved mKOOS global scores in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 (P = 0.023), and improved 
total and physical function subscale of mWOMAC relative to baseline, 2) improved 
VAS scores for Knee Discomfort with activity/exercise in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 
(P = 0.001) relative to baseline, 3) improved VAS scores for whole-body joint 
function in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 (P < 0.029) relative to baseline, 4) improved 
VAS score for decreased knee joint soreness following leg extension challenge 
for AyuFlex1 (P = 0.022) and AyuFlex2 (P = 0.043) relative to baseline, 5) 
improved 6-min walk performance distance covered (P = 0.047) and VAS discomfort 
(P = 0.026) post-6 min walk in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 relative to baseline, 6) and 
tended to decrease COMP levels in AyuFlex1 + AyuFLex2 (P = 0.104) relative to 
baseline. All biomarkers of safety remained within normative limits during the 
study. Low back health tended to improve in the AyuFlex1 and AyuFlex2 group, but 
failed to reach significance relative to placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: AyuFlex® improved mKOOS global scores, knee joint discomfort with 
activity/exercise, 6-min walk test distance covered and discomfort post-6 min 
walk test, overall whole-body joint function, knee soreness following leg 
extension resistance exercise in a healthy, overweight population, without AE. 
Differences between 250 mg/BID and 500 mg/BID were non-significant for most of 
the outcome measures, validating the efficacy of the lower dose.

Septic ankle arthritis is a devastating clinical entity with high risks of 
morbidity and mortality. Prompt treatment is necessary because delayed or 
inadequate treatment can lead to irreversible damage that may occur on the 
articular surface, resulting in cartilage erosion, infective synovitis, 
osteomyelitis, joint deformity, and pain and joint dysfunction. An aggressive 
surgical approach is required when a joint infection causes severe 
limb-threatening arthritis. A 58-year-old woman visited our clinic with 
increasing pain in the right ankle, which had been present for the previous 2 
months. She complained of discomfort in daily life due to deformity of the 
ankle; limping; and severe pain in the ankle even after walking a little. The 
patient reported a history of right-ankle injury while exiting a bus in her 
early 20s. Plain radiographs of the right ankle joint revealed that the medial 
malleolus was nearly absent in the right ankle joint on the anteroposterior 
view, and severe varus deformity was observed with osteoarthritic changes 
because of joint space destruction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse 
synovial thickening of the destroyed tibiotalar joint with joint effusion. 
Hybrid 99mTc white blood cell single-photon emission computed 
tomography/computed tomography showed increased uptake along the soft tissue 
around the ankle joint; uptake was generally low in the talocrural and subtalar 
joints. A two-stage operation was performed to remove the infected lesions and 
correct the deformity, thus enabling limb salvage. The patient was nearly 
asymptomatic at the 6-month follow-up, with no discomfort in her daily life and 
nearly normal ability to carry out full functional activities. She had no 
complications or recurrent symptoms at the 1-year follow-up. We have described a 
rare case of a staged limb salvage procedure in a patient with chronic septic 
arthritis sequelae. For patients with severe joint deformity because of septic 
ankle sequelae, staged arthrodesis is a reliable method to remove infected 
lesions, solve soft tissue problems, correct deformities, and maintain leg 
length.

We report a case of a 77-year-old man who presented to our shoulder department 
with a soft tissue mass on his right acromioclavicular (AC) joint. Previously 
attempted puncture aspiration had revealed serous fluid retention which recurred 
after each of several drainage attempts. Conventional radiography and MRI of the 
affected shoulder joint demonstrated a progressed cuff-tear arthropathy with an 
irreparable tear of the supraspinatus tendon, static superior migration of the 
humeral head, opening of the AC joint capsule and a superior joint-fluid 
'eruption' and accumulation called 'Geyser sign'. Given that the patient's 
cuff-tear arthropathy was very well compensated, arthroscopic rotator cuff 
debridement and open cyst excision were performed. Closure of the superior 
aspect of the AC joint capsule was performed by the aid of a collagen matrix 
with additional closure of the deltotrapezial fascia. One year postoperatively, 
no cyst recurrence was noted.

Optical imaging: new tools for arthritis.

Conventional radiography, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging are the 
current imaging modalities used for clinical evaluation of arthritis which is 
highly prevalent and a leading cause of disability. Some of these types of 
imaging are also used for monitoring disease progression and treatment response 
of arthritis. However, their disadvantages limit their utilities, such as 
ionizing radiation for radiography, CT, and nuclear imaging; suboptimal tissue 
contrast resolution for radiography, CT, ultrasound, and nuclear imaging; high 
cost for CT and MRI and nuclear imaging; and long data-acquisition time with 
ensuing patient discomfort for MRI. Recently, there have been considerable 
advances in nonionizing noninvasive optical imaging which has demonstrated 
promise for early diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic interventions and disease 
progression of arthritis. Optical based molecular imaging modalities such as 
fluorescence imaging have shown high sensitivity in detection of optical 
contrast agents and can aid early diagnosis and ongoing evaluation of chronic 
inflammatory arthritis. Optical transillumination imaging or diffuse optical 
tomography may differentiate normal joint clear synovial fluid from turbid and 
pink medium early in the inflammatory process. Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy has been used to evaluate fluid composition from joints affected by 
arthritis. Hemodynamic changes such as angiogenesis, hypervascularization, and 
hypoxia in arthritic articular tissue can potentially be observed by diffuse 
optical tomography and photoacoustic tomography. Optical measurements could also 
facilitate quantification of hemodynamic properties such as blood volume and 
oxygenation levels at early stages of inflammatory arthritis. Optical imaging 
provides methodologies which should contribute to detection of early changes and 
monitoring of progression in pathological characteristics of arthritis, with 
relatively simple instrumentation.

AIMS: There is evidence of association between bruxism and the increasingly 
common central nervous system stimulants prescribed for attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) often prescribed for depression or anxiety. However, the 
evidence is not clear on whether these medications inducing bruxism are directly 
associated with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). The aim of this work is 
to evaluate whether these medications are associated with TMD symptoms.
METHODS: Medical history and participant data were obtained for 469 patients 
from the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, Dental Registry and 
DNA Repository, dating back to 2006. The chi-square test was used to determine 
any statistically significant associations.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant associations between ADHD 
stimulant medications or SSRIs and reported TMD symptoms. However, there were 
significant differences seen between specific brands of medications and reported 
TMD symptoms. Individuals prescribed methylphenidate (Concerta) were less likely 
to report temporomandibular joint discomfort (p = 0.01). Conversely, individuals 
prescribed citalopram (Celexa) were more likely to report temporomandibular 
joint discomfort (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction may be 
influenced by the use of certain medications prescribed for depression or 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder.

Joint injection of the hip and knee regions is a useful diagnostic and 
therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection 
procedure for the greater trochanteric bursa, the knee joint, the pes anserine 
bursa, the iliotibial band, and the prepatellar bursa is reviewed. Indications 
for greater trochanteric bursa injection include acute and chronic inflammation 
associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive use, and other 
traumatic injuries to the area. For the knee joint, aspiration may be performed 
to aid in the diagnosis of an unexplained effusion and relieve discomfort caused 
by an effusion. Injection of the knee can be performed for viscosupplementation 
or corticosteroid therapy. Indications for corticosteroid injection include 
advanced osteoarthritis and other inflammatory arthritides, such as gout or 
calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. Swelling and tenderness of pes 
anserine or prepatellar bursae can be relieved with aspiration and 
corticosteroid injection. Persistent pain and disability from iliotibial band 
syndrome respond to local injection therapy. The proper technique, choice and 
quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for 
effective outcomes.

Preservation of stapedius muscle and incudo-stapedial joint during stapedotomy 
for otosclerosis is the motto of the dat. The Study was carried out in 500 
patients. In Group A (n = 140), the stapedius muscle and incudostapedial joint 
were preserved. In Group B (n = 360), the stapedius muscle was cut. One month 
after surgery in Group A patients, the Stapedius-Reflex (SR) was evoked in 75% 
and three months later in 90%. The mean Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) after 
one month of surgery in Group A was 95dB while three months after it was 
increased to 110dB. Speech discrimination score (SDS) in Group A with 80 dB 
suprathreshold is 93% and in Group B it is only 72%. This study established the 
fact that the preservation of stapedial muscle and incudo stapedial join is 
beneficial and essential, whenever possible, in the surgery for otosclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is an uncommon disease that 
usually occurs in large joints, and involvement of the subtalar joint is rare. 
The lack of comprehensive knowledge of subtalar joint PVNS could lead to 
misdiagnosis.
CASE SUMMARY: We present a 64-year-old woman who, at her first visit, complained 
of discomfort in the right ankle when she walked. Based on the physical signs 
and X-ray report, the physician failed to make the suspected diagnosis of PVNS. 
Eighteen months later, the patient returned with a complaint of a mass in her 
right lateral malleolus with intermittent blunt pain. The X-ray presented an 
osteophyte formation and soft tissue calcification at the margin of the subtalar 
joint. The laboratory tests were normal, whereas magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) showed a low-intensity area on both T1- and T2-weighted images. A 
suspected diagnosis of PVNS was made and later confirmed by postoperative 
pathology. Subsequently, the patient received radiotherapy with 32 Gy in 16 
fractions. At 6 mo postoperatively, the patient only complained of discomfort 
after walking three blocks. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society 
Ankle-Hindfoot score was 97.
CONCLUSION: MRI is necessary for the diagnosis of PVNS. Early soft tissue 
calcification and painless joint swelling should be of concern.

INTRODUCTION: Electrostimulation devices stimulate the common peroneal nerve, 
producing a calf muscle-pump action to promote venous circulation. Whether knee 
joint angle influences calf neuromuscular activity remains unclear. Our aim was 
to determine the effects of knee joint angle on lower limb neuromuscular 
activity during electrostimulation.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy, older adults underwent 60 min of electrostimulation, 
with the knee joint at three different angles (0°, 45° or 90° flexion; random 
order; 20 min each). Outcome variables included electromyography of the peroneus 
longus, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis and 
discomfort.
RESULTS: Knee angle did not influence tibialis anterior and peroneus longus 
neuromuscular activity during electrostimulation. Neuromuscular activity was 
greater in the gastrocnemius medialis (p = 0.002) and lateralis (p = 0.002) at 
90°, than 0° knee angle. Electrostimulation intensity was positively related to 
neuromuscular activity for each muscle, with a knee angle effect for the 
gastrocnemius medialis (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that during electrostimulation, knee joint angle 
influenced gastrocnemii neuromuscular activity; increased gastrocnemius medialis 
activity across all intensities (at 90°), when compared to 0° and 45° flexion; 
and did not influence peroneus longus and tibialis anterior activity. Greater 
electrostimulation-evoked gastrocnemii activity has implications for producing a 
more forceful calf muscle-pump action, potentially further improving venous 
flow.

Brucella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) primarily affect the spine and 
only rarely the knee joint in osteoarticular disease in adults. We present an 
unusual instance of brucellar knee arthritis combined with knee joint 
tuberculosis. A 59-year-old man was initially diagnosed with brucellar knee 
arthritis in the orthopedics department of our hospital, while two weeks of 
standardized treatment did not improve the joint discomfort and inflammation 
indexes. Subsequent evaluation of serum tuberculosis interferon-gamma release 
assays (TB-IGRAs) and the effectiveness of empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy 
confirmed the mixed infection of tuberculosis. This case report demonstrates 
that clinical signs and imaging for brucellar knee arthritis and knee joint 
tuberculosis are similar. Patients with both disorders are more likely to be 
misdiagnosed or have their diagnosis delayed; clinicians should be aware of this 
uncommon combination of mixed infections.

Kinesio Taping as a Therapeutic Tool for Masticatory Myofascial Pain Syndrome-An 
Insight View.

Dentistry, Jazan University, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia.

Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is thought to stem from masticatory muscle 
hypersensitivity. Masticatory myofascial pain syndrome (MMPS) is characterized 
by multiple trigger points (MTrPs), also known as hyperirritable points, in taut 
bands of affected muscles, regional muscle pain, or referred pain to nearby 
maxillofacial areas like teeth, masticatory muscles or the temporomandibular 
joint (TMJ). Muscle stiffness, reduced range of motion, muscle weakening without 
atrophy, and autonomic symptoms may accompany regional discomfort. Multiple 
treatments have been utilized to reduce trigger points and mandibular function 
restrictions. As a result of these incapacitating symptoms, MMPS can 
significantly impair many elements of quality of life. The application of 
Kinesio tape (KT) is a non-invasive method of treating dormant myofascial 
trigger points. Utilizing the body's innate capacity for self-repair, this 
technique entails taping specific regions of the skin. KT alleviates discomfort, 
decreases swelling and inflammation, enhances or suppresses motor function in 
the muscles, stimulates proprioception, promotes lymphatic drainage, stimulates 
blood flow, and expedites tissue recovery. However, studies conducted to assess 
its effects have frequently yielded contradictory results. To the best of our 
knowledge, just a few research has looked into the therapeutic effects of KT on 
MMPS. The purpose of this review is to determine the efficacy of KT as a 
therapeutic tool for regular treatment or as an adjunct to existing therapy for 
MMPS based on the evidence presented in this review. To establish KT as a 
reliable independent treatment option, additional research is necessary to 
confirm the efficacy of KT techniques and applications, specifically randomized 
clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: To improve assessment of arthritis joint pain in American Indians by 
describing how symptoms are communicated.
METHOD: In-depth interviews were conducted with American Indians who experience 
chronic joint pain (n = 56), to elicit descriptions and self-reported ratings of 
pain, disability, and beliefs associated with the pain for affected joints (n = 
326).
RESULTS: Discrete sets of specific verbal descriptions distinguished 
inflammatory arthritis (n = 20 terms) from noninflammatory arthritis (n = 22 
terms), and indicated levels of pain intensity. An additional set of 14 vague 
but commonly used verbal descriptors did not distinguish the type of joint 
disease or pain intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: Subtle pain complaints and vague verbal descriptions, such as 
"ache," "hurt," and "discomfort," may reflect severe pain symptoms, disability, 
and more serious joint disease in American Indian patients. In addition, certain 
specific sensory descriptions used by American Indians suggest inflammatory 
arthritis and may warrant further evaluation.

Heel pain is a common condition in adults that may cause significant discomfort 
and disability. A variety of soft tissue, osseous, and systemic disorders can 
cause heel pain. Narrowing the differential diagnosis begins with a history and 
physical examination of the lower extremity to pinpoint the anatomic origin of 
the heel pain. The most common cause of heel pain in adults is plantar 
fasciitis. Patients with plantar fasciitis report increased heel pain with their 
first steps in the morning or when they stand up after prolonged sitting. 
Tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity usually is apparent on examination and is 
increased with passive dorsiflexion of the toes. Tendonitis also may cause heel 
pain. Achilles tendonitis is associated with posterior heel pain. Bursae 
adjacent to the Achilles tendon insertion may become inflamed and cause pain. 
Calcaneal stress fractures are more likely to occur in athletes who participate 
in sports that require running and jumping. Patients with plantar heel pain 
accompanied by tingling, burning, or numbness may have tarsal tunnel syndrome. 
Heel pad atrophy may present with diffuse plantar heel pain, especially in 
patients who are older and obese. Less common causes of heel pain, which should 
be considered when symptoms are prolonged or unexplained, include osteomyelitis, 
bony abnormalities (such as calcaneal stress fracture), or tumor. Heel pain 
rarely is a presenting symptom in patients with systemic illnesses, but the 
latter may be a factor in persons with bilateral heel pain, pain in other 
joints, or known inflammatory arthritis conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Bisphosphonates are considered potential disease modifying 
osteoarthritis (OA) agents. The present study investigated the efficacy of 
pre-emptive, early, and delayed alendronate (ALN) treatment initiation on 
subchondral trabecular bone and cartilage in low-dose monosodium iodoacetate 
(MIA)-induced knee OA in rats.
METHODS: Male rats received pre-emptive (n = 12, day 0-end of week 2), early 
(n = 12, end of week 2-end of week 6), or delayed (n = 12, end of week 6-end of 
week 10) ALN treatment (30 μg/kg/week). Pre-emptive ALN-treated rats were 
scanned using in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) after 2 weeks and 
then sacrificed, early ALN-treated rats were scanned after 2 and 6 weeks and 
sacrificed, and the delayed ALN-treated rats were scanned after 2, 6, and 10 
weeks of OA induction and sacrificed. After sacrifice, bone histomorphometry and 
histology of the tibia and biomarker analyses were undertaken. Changes in hind 
limb weight-bearing were assessed from day -1 until day 14.
RESULTS: MIA-induced pathological features similar to progressive human OA in 
the cartilage and subchondral bone. Pre-emptive ALN treatment preserved 
subchondral trabecular bone microarchitecture, prevented bone loss, decreased 
bone turnover and joint discomfort. Pre-emptive ALN treatment had moderate 
effects on cartilage degradation. Early and delayed ALN treatments prevented 
loss of trabeculae and decreased bone turnover, but had no significant effect on 
cartilage degradation.
CONCLUSION: ALN prevented increased bone turnover and preserved the structural 
integrity of subchondral bone in experimental OA. The time point of treatment 
initiation is crucial for treating OA. Treating both the subchondral bone and 
cartilage in OA would be clinically more beneficial.

PURPOSE: Both repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) and 
transcutaneous electrical current stimulation (TES) could elicit the limb 
movements; it is still unclear how subjective sensation is changed according to 
the amount of limb movements. We investigated the pain and discomfort induced by 
newly developed rPMS and TES of peripheral nerves in the dorsal forearm.
METHODS: The subjects were 12 healthy adults. The stimulus site was the right 
dorsal forearm; thus, when stimulated, wrist dorsiflexion was induced. The rPMS 
was delivered by the new stimulator, Pathleader at 10 stimulus intensity levels, 
and TES intensity was in 1-mA increments. The duration of each stimulation was 2 
s. The analysis parameters were subjective pain and discomfort, measured by a 
numerical rating scale. The rating scale at corresponding levels of integrated 
range of movement (iROM) induced by rPMS or TES was compared. The subjective 
values were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA with the stimulus 
conditions (rPMS, TES) and the seven levels of iROM (20-140 ºs).
RESULTS: In the rPMS experiments, stimuli were administered to all subjects at 
all stimulus intensities. In the TES experiments, none of the subjects dropped 
out between 1 and 16 mA, but there were dropouts at each of the intensities as 
follows: 1 subject at 17 mA, 20 mA, 22 mA, 23 mA, 27 mA, 29 mA and 2 subjects at 
21 mA, 24 mA, 26 mA. The main effects of the stimulus conditions and iROM were 
significant for pain and discomfort. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that pain 
and discomfort in rPMS were significantly lower compared to TES when the iROM 
was above 60 ºs and 80 ºs, respectively.
CONCLUSION: New rPMS stimulator, Pathleader, caused less pain and discomfort 
than TES, but this was only evident when comparatively large joint movements 
occurred.

"It's Not My Knee": Understanding Ongoing Pain and Discomfort After Total Knee 
Replacement Through Re-Embodiment.

OBJECTIVE: Up to 20% of people who undergo total knee replacement surgery have 
ongoing pain and discomfort. The aim of this study was to understand what role 
the concepts of embodiment (of both having a body and experiencing the world 
through one's body) and incorporation (integrating something into one's body) 
might have in understanding experiences of pain and discomfort after total knee 
replacement.
METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 34 people who had received 
total knee replacement at either of 2 National Health Service hospitals in the 
UK, and who had chronic postsurgical pain (n = 34, ages 55-93 years). Data were 
audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Two main themes were identified: 1) when describing chronic 
postsurgical pain, some participants also described sensations of discomfort, 
including heaviness, numbness, pressure, and tightness associated with the 
prosthesis; 2) participants reported a lack of felt connection with and agency 
over their replaced knee, often describing it as alien or other, and lacked 
confidence in the knee.
CONCLUSION: Participants' experiences indicate that some people do not achieve 
full incorporation of the prosthesis. Our study emphasizes the importance of 
physicians treating patients as whole people and moving beyond clinical and 
procedural ideas of success. Our findings suggest that to optimize postoperative 
outcomes, rehabilitation must focus not only on strengthening the joint and 
promoting full recovery to tasks but on modifying a person's relationship to the 
new joint and managing sensations of otherness to achieve full incorporation of 
the joint or re-embodiment.

During the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, many people were 
infected, and the symptoms may persist for several weeks or months for 
recovering patients. This is also known as "long COVID" and includes symptoms 
such as fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, et cetera. The COVID-19 virus may 
trigger hyper-inflammation associated with cytokine levels in the body. COVID-19 
can trigger inflammation in the joints, which can lead to osteoarthritis (OA), 
while long-term COVID-19 symptoms may lead to joint damage and other 
inflammation problems. According to several studies, sesame has potent 
anti-inflammatory properties due to its major constituent, sesamin. This study 
examined sesamin's anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoarthritis, and anti-COVID-19 
effects. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro assays were used to determine sesamin's 
anti-inflammatory activity against the RAW264.7 and SW1353 cell lines. Sesamin 
had a dose-dependent effect (20 mg/kg) in a monoiodoacetic acid (MIA)-induced 
osteoarthritis rat model. Sesamin reduced paw swelling and joint discomfort. In 
addition, the findings indicated that sesamin suppressed the expression of iNOS 
(inducible nitric oxide synthase) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in the RAW264.7 
cell line within the concentration range of 6.25-50 μM. Furthermore, sesamin 
also had a suppressive effect on MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) expression in 
chondrocytes and the SW1353 cell line within the same concentration range of 
6.25-50 μM. To examine the anti-viral activity, an in silico analysis was 
performed to evaluate sesamin's binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and human 
ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Compared to the controls, sesamin 
exhibited strong binding affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and human ACE2. 
Furthermore, sesamin had a higher binding affinity for the ACE2 target protein. 
This study suggests that sesamin shows potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for 
drug development.

[Diagnosis of Lateral Ankle Ligament Injury in the Evaluation of Chronic Lateral 
Ankle Instability].

[Article in Korean]

Jeon JY.

Chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI) is a major complication of acute ankle 
sprain that can cause discomfort in both daily and sports activities and may 
lead to degenerative changes in the ankle joint as the long-term sequelae. The 
precise cause of CLAI remains debatable and is most probably multifactorial. 
However, identifying chronic lateral ankle ligament injury is critical in 
determining the primary etiology and formulating an appropriate treatment plan. 
This review discusses the features and effectiveness of various imaging 
techniques in diagnosing chronic lateral ankle ligament injury.

만성 외측 발목 불안정(chronic lateral ankle instability; 이하 CLAI)은 급성 발목 염좌의 주요 합병증으로 
일상생활과 스포츠 활동에 불편을 줄 수 있으며, 장기 후유증으로 발목 관절에 퇴행성 변화를 가져오기도 한다. CLAI의 정확한 원인은 여전히 
논쟁 중이며 다인자적으로 알려져 있으나, 특히 만성적인 외측 발목 인대 손상 여부를 확인하는 것이 환자의 원발 병소를 결정하고 적절한 치료 
계획을 수립하는 데 필수적이다. 본 종설에서는 CLAI에서 인대 손상을 진단하는데 이용되는 여러 검사들의 특징과 유용성에 대해 기술해 보았다.

In this paper, we have aimed to elucidate the therapeutic effect of 
intramedullary nailing (IMN) in treating comminuted proximal humeral fractures 
(CPHFs) and its influence on the recovery of shoulder joint function. For this 
purpose, 60 cases with CPHFs were selected, particularly from January 2020 to 
October 2021. In these cases, 28 cases were treated with a locking proximal 
humeral plate (LPHP) and assigned to the control (Con) group and the remaining 
32 patients were treated with IMN and included in the research (Res) group. The 
therapeutic effect, surgical indicators, total complications, visual analogue 
scale (VAS) score, and postoperative shoulder joint function score were compared 
between the two arms. We observed that compared with the Con group, the 
effective rate in the Res group was higher while the operation time, 
intraoperative blood loss, and fracture healing time were shorter, the overall 
complication rate and VAS score were lower, and the postoperative shoulder joint 
function score was higher, all with statistical significance. The above results 
indicate that IMN is effective and safe in the treatment of CPHFs, which can 
validly reduce the discomfort of patients and facilitate the recovery of 
shoulder joint function.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged neck flexion during smartphone use is known as a factor of 
neck pain and alteration of neck muscle activity. Studies on the effects of 
shoulder taping on neck discomfort and neck muscle responses while texting on a 
smartphone are still lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the effects 
of shoulder taping on neck discomfort using a numerical rating scale, and neck 
muscle activity and fatigue using a surface electromyography during a texting 
task on a touchscreen smartphone.
METHODS: Twenty-five healthy adolescents used the dominant hand to perform a 
30-minute texting task using a touchscreen smartphone at two separate times 
under one of the following two conditions: taping across the upper trapezius 
muscle and no taping. Neck discomfort, normalized root mean square, and 
normalized median frequency slopes for upper trapezius, cervical erector spinae, 
and sternocleidomastoid muscles were recorded.
RESULTS: The results revealed that shoulder taping provided significantly lower 
neck discomfort than no taping (p < 0.001). However, shoulder taping did not 
significantly alter normalized root mean square and normalized median frequency 
slope values of all muscles when compared with no taping controls.
CONCLUSION: Shoulder taping reduces neck discomfort but does not affect neck 
muscle activity and fatigue while texting on a touchscreen smartphone.

INTRODUCTION: Acromioclavicular joint cyst (AJC) is a very uncommon condition of 
the shoulder observed in elderly patients, caused by a degenerative 
acromioclavicular (AC) joint, frequently associated to a rotator cuff tendon 
tear. There are two possible cause for the cyst formation. We report two 
different cases of a AC synovial cyst, with and without rotator cuff tear.
PRESENTATION OF CASES: We report two cases, in patients aged respectively 80 and 
77 years, with a very large AJC. In one case, the cyst was associated to a 
rotator cuff tear, while in the other case, the rotator cuff did not present any 
evident lesion. Both cysts were successfully surgical excised and a distal 
clavicle resection was performed.
DISCUSSION: AJC is a rare complication observed in degenerative AC joint and in 
the majority of cases is associated to a rotator cuff tear. The diagnosis may be 
made by ultrasound and conventional radiographic examination, although MRI of 
the shoulder is generally preferred as it allows to better identify the 
condition of the rotator cuff. Generally, local aspiration of the cyst and 
corticosteroid injection fails with recurrence of the cyst and surgically 
treatment is indicated, especially in painful cases.
CONCLUSION: Painful AJC should be surgically treated by excision of the cyst 
associated to a lateral clavicle resection; when a symptomatic massive rotator 
cuff is present, a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty may be considered. 
However, in elderly patients, who have no discomfort, watchful waiting may be 
the treatment of choice.

Musculoskeletal Disorders associated with the elbow are one of the most common 
forms of work-related injuries. Exoskeletons have been proposed as an approach 
to reduce and ideally eliminate these injuries; however, exoskeletons introduce 
their own problems, especially discomfort due to joint misalignment. The 
Elbow-sideWINDER with its associated control strategy is a novel elbow 
exoskeleton to assist elbow flexion/extension during occupational tasks. This 
study describes the exoskeleton showing how this can minimize discomfort caused 
by joint misalignment, maximize assistive performance, and provide increased 
robustness and reliability in real worksites. The proposed medium-level control 
strategy can provide effective assistive torque using three control units as 
follows: an arm kinematics estimator, a load estimator, and a friction 
compensator. The combined hardware/software system of the Elbow-sideWINDER is 
tested in load-lifting tasks (2 and 7 kg). This experiment focuses on the 
reduction in the activation level of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii in 
both arms and the change in the range of motion of the elbow during the task. It 
is shown that using the Elbow-sideWINDER, the biceps brachii, responsible for 
the elbow flexion, was significantly less activated (up to 38.8% at 2 kg and 
25.7% at 7 kg, on average for both arms). For the triceps brachii, the muscle 
activation was reduced by up to 37.0% at 2 kg and 35.1% at 7 kg, on average for 
both arms. When wearing the exoskeleton, the range of motion of the elbow was 
reduced by up to 13.0° during the task, but it was within a safe range and could 
be compensated for by other joints such as the waist or knees. There are 
extremely encouraging results that provide good indicators and important clues 
for future improvement of the Elbow-sideWINDER and its control strategy.

Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare disease. It is a benign 
neoplastic process typically affecting young to middle-aged adults and most 
commonly involving the knee, hip, and shoulder joints. The symptoms include 
diffuse pain and swelling with discomfort. We report a rare case of localized 
PVNS originating at the proximal tibiofibular joint in a 39-year-old female 
patient with radiologic changes for short duration of time. The clinical 
history, plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and pathologic findings 
of the reported patient were reviewed. Complete surgical excision was performed 
and there was no evidence of recurrence after one-year follow-up.

Background A range of diseases affecting the jaw muscles and/or 
temporomandibular joint are referred to as temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). 
Nearly 80% of the general population is affected by TMDs, and 48% of those 
people have trouble opening their mouths and have painful muscles. Aim To 
compare the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 
and microcurrent nerve stimulation (MENS) for the relief of masticatory muscle 
discomfort. Methods Groups I and II were further separated into two groups of 30 
persons each (A and B), as well as subgroups C and D. Subjects in Group I 
received TENS treatment for 20 minutes at frequencies of 0-5 and 5-5 for 
subgroups A and B, and with visual analog scale (VAS) scores of 1-5 and 6-10 for 
subgroups C and D, respectively. Subjects in Group II received MENS for 20 
minutes, with subgroups C and D receiving the same frequency and VAS score as 
subgroups A and B, respectively. All individuals underwent treatment with a 
comparable frequency and length of time every day for five days. Results For 
subgroup D treated with MENS, there was a considerable reduction in pain; 
however, for subgroups A and C, there was a comparable reduction in the VAS 
score for both groups treated with MENS and TENS therapy. Conclusion Compared to 
TENS, MENS provides quicker and more effective pain relief. Paresthesia and 
tingling are two adverse effects of TENS that are not present with MENS. 
However, MENS and TENS are equally helpful at treating masticatory muscle 
discomfort that is both acute and chronic, as well as improving mouth opening.

BACKGROUND: Dislocation of the elbow joint is a relatively uncommon injury.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of various forms of treatment for acute simple 
elbow dislocations in adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register (April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March Week 5 
2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 14), PEDro (April 2011), CINAHL (April 2011), 
various trial registers, various conference proceedings and bibliographies of 
relevant articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of 
conservative and surgical treatment of dislocations of the elbow in adults. 
Excluded were trials involving dislocations with associated fractures, except 
for avulsion fractures.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias 
were independently performed by two review authors. There was no pooling of 
data.
MAIN RESULTS: Two small randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 80 
participants with simple elbow dislocations, were included. Both trials were 
methodologically flawed and potentially biased.One trial, involving 50 
participants, compared early mobilisation at three days post reduction versus 
cast immobilisation. At one year follow-up, the recovery of range of motion 
appeared better in the early mobilisation group (e.g. participants with 
incomplete recovery of extension: 1/24 versus 5/26; risk ratio 0.22, 95% 
confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72). However, the results were not statistically 
significant. There were no reports of instability or recurrence. One person in 
each group had residual pain at one year.The other trial, involving 30 
participants, compared surgical repair of the torn ligaments versus conservative 
treatment (cast immobilisation for two weeks). At final follow-up (mean 27.5 
months), there were no statistically significant differences between the two 
groups in the numbers of patients who considered their injured elbow to be 
inferior to their non-injured elbow (10/14 versus 7/14; RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.77 to 
2.66) or in other patient complaints about their elbow such as weakness, pain or 
weather-related discomfort. There were no reports of instability or recurrence. 
There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in 
range of motion of the elbow (extension, flexion, pronation, and supination) or 
grip strength at follow-up. No participants had neurological disturbances of the 
hand but two surgical group participants had recurrent dislocation of the ulnar 
nerve (no other details provided). One person in each group had radiologically 
detected myositis ossificans (bone formation within muscles following injury).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled 
trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for simple 
dislocations of the elbow in adults. Although weak and inconclusive, the 
available evidence from a trial comparing surgery versus conservative treatment 
does not suggest that the surgical repair of elbow ligaments for simple elbow 
dislocation improves long-term function. Future research should focus on 
questions relating to non-surgical treatment, such as the duration of 
immobilisation.

PURPOSE: Despite its many health benefits, moderate exercise can induce joint 
discomfort when done infrequently or too intensely even in individuals with 
healthy joints. This study was designed to evaluate whether NEM® (natural 
eggshell membrane) would reduce exercise-induced cartilage turnover or alleviate 
joint pain or stiffness, either directly following exercise or 12 hours post 
exercise, versus placebo.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty healthy, postmenopausal women were randomly assigned 
to receive either oral NEM 500 mg (n=30) or placebo (n=30) once daily for two 
consecutive weeks while performing an exercise regimen (50-100 steps per leg) on 
alternating days. The primary endpoint was any statistically significant 
reduction in exercise-induced cartilage turnover via the biomarker C-terminal 
cross-linked telopeptide of type-II collagen (CTX-II) versus placebo, evaluated 
at 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were any reductions in either 
exercise-induced joint pain or stiffness versus placebo, evaluated daily via 
participant questionnaire. The clinical assessment was performed on the per 
protocol population.
RESULTS: NEM produced a significant absolute treatment effect (TEabs) versus 
placebo for CTX-II after both 1 week (TEabs -17.2%, P=0.002) and 2 weeks of 
exercise (TEabs -9.9%, P=0.042). Immediate pain was not significantly different; 
however, rapid treatment responses were observed for immediate stiffness (Day 7) 
and recovery pain (Day 8) and recovery stiffness (Day 4). No serious adverse 
events occurred and the treatment was reported to be well tolerated by study 
participants.
CONCLUSION: NEM rapidly improved recovery from exercise-induced joint pain (Day 
8) and stiffness (Day 4) and reduced discomfort immediately following exercise 
(stiffness, Day 7). Moreover, a substantial chondroprotective effect was 
demonstrated via a decrease in the cartilage degradation biomarker CTX-II.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of type I-B triangular fibrocartilage complex 
superficial injury is always a challenge to orthopedists. The traditional 
outside-in suture method often causes a risk of nervous irritation. We designed 
a modified outside-in suture through the joint capsule to repair the Palmer I-B 
triangular fibrocartilage complex superficial injury.
METHODS: From December 2014 to December 2018, we retrospectively collected the 
medical records of 18 patients in our hospital who used the modified outside-in 
suture through the joint capsule to repair type I-B triangular fibrocartilage 
complex superficial injury. Among them, there were 12 males and 6 females, with 
an average age of 36.2 years. There were 6 cases on the left side and 12 cases 
on the right side. Record the healing time of all patients after surgery and the 
occurrence of related complications, and record the pain visual analogue scale 
(VAS), grip strength, wrist flexion and extension, radioulnar deviation and 
forearm rotation range of motion, modified Mayo wrist joint function score, and 
disability of arm-shoulder-hand (DASH) score before operation and at the last 
follow-up.
RESULTS: One patient was lost to follow-up, and a total of 17 patients received 
the final follow-up. Patients were followed up for 24 to 36 months, with an 
average of 29.6 ± 3.0 months. No wound infection, nerve damage, or irritation 
occurred after the operation. At the last follow-up, 15 cases of wrist pain 
disappeared completely, and 2 cases had mild discomfort during exercise. At the 
last follow-up, VAS decreased from 3.8 ± 0.7 points before operation to 0.8 ± 
0.7 points (P < 0.05); grip strength increased from 15.1 ± 3.1 kg before 
operation to 23.2 ± 1.5 kg (P < 0.05); wrist flexion and extension, radioulnar 
deflection, and forearm rotational mobility increased from 116.3 ± 2.2°, 37.0 ± 
3.5°, and 141.6 ± 2.2° before operation to 117.2 ± 2.5° (P < 0.05), 38.9 ± 3.0° 
(P < 0.05), and 142.4 ± 1.9° (P < 0.05), respectively; the modified Mayo wrist 
joint function score increased from 66.1 ± 3.6 points to 82.5 ± 3.9 points (P < 
0.05), of which 10 cases were excellent, 5 cases were good, 2 cases were fair, 
and the excellent and good rate was 88.2%; DASH score improved from 37.0 ± 5.7 
points preoperatively to 8.0 ± 2.5 points (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The modified outside-in suture through the joint capsule to repair 
the superficial injury of Palmer I-B triangular fibrocartilage complex has a 
good clinical effect and is worthy of clinical widespread promotion.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise 
program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal 
discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise 
program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint 
mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core 
muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to 
evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire 
was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the 
beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training 
program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine 
differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that 
trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the 
dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the 
non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, 
which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in 
the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67). In 
conclusion, MED appears to improve in office workers after a six week training 
program, which may be explained by a decrease in trapezius tone and increase in 
the left middle trapezius tone.

BACKGROUND: The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) forms a complex joint and has shown to be 
underappreciated in its involvement with lower back pain. Research efforts have 
intensified on SIJ anatomy and biomechanics because of its predisposing position 
to pain and dysfunction in individuals suffering from lower back discomfort. 
Previous work has focused on SIJ anatomy including bone and joint structure, 
innervation, as well as biomechanics and the treatment of SIJ pain. However, to 
date, no review exists describing the range of 'normal' anatomic features of the 
SIJ.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the normal appearance of the SIJ and adjacent tissues, 
as opposed to 'abnormal' conditions involving SIJ morphology. It will also 
identify key areas that require further study because of lacking information or 
disagreement.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature review.
SETTING: The research took place at the University of Otago, New Zealand. All 
published research on 'normal SIJ anatomy' available from MEDLINE, OVID, Scopus, 
Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct were included, available until 
December 2018, in English, French, and German. Subject areas included bony 
landmarks, joint type, bone morphology, ligamentous attachments, muscular and 
fascial relationships, blood supply, fatty infiltration, and morphologic 
variation.
METHODS: Articles met the selection criteria if they contained specific 
information on SIJ anatomy, including bone morphology and architecture, 
ligaments, muscle attachments, innervation, vasculature, and the presence of 
fat. Biomechanics and kinematics related keywords were used as the literature 
often couples these with the anatomy. Keywords of individual articles were named 
as 'structures of interest.'
RESULTS: A total of 88 primary and 101 secondary articles were identified in the 
time frame from 1851 to 2018. Primary articles provided quantitative data and 
detailed anatomic descriptions. Secondary articles did not focus specifically on 
the anatomy of the SIJ. Although research appeared to be in general agreement on 
bony landmarks, joint type, myofascial attachments, vasculature, and innervation 
of the SIJ, there was only part consensus on ligament attachments and cartilage 
structure. Information regarding bone density of the articulating surfaces of 
the SIJ is lacking. Despite its potential clinical significance, fatty 
infiltration within the joint lacks research to date.
LIMITATIONS: Only the given databases were used for the initial search. Keyword 
combinations used for this review may not have been inclusive of all articles 
relevant to the SIJ. Work in languages other than the ones listed or work that 
is not available via the internet may be missing.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of normal SIJ structures, including 
all neuromusculoskeletal elements related to the joint. There is a lack of 
knowledge on the SIJ ligaments warranting further investigation. Furthermore, 
there are discrepancies in relation to the nomenclature, layers, attachment 
sites, and on the topographical relationships between ligamentous tissues and 
nerves. Subsequent studies on the quantification of fat and bone density in the 
SIJ have been suggested. These could be useful radiologic parameters to assess 
the condition of the joint clinically. This review may provide insight into the 
clinical signs and abnormal biomechanical features of the joint for the purposes 
of treating SIJ pain.

BACKGROUND: Thoracic facet joint disorder is a common thoracic disorder in 
clinic, inducing pain and discomfort at the dislocated thoracic vertebrae, 
radiating to pain of the neck and back. The incidence of thoracic facet joint 
disorder is higher than the facet disorder of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae. 
Therefore, an ideal strategy to relieve thoracic facet joint disorder is 
urgently needed. In recent years, massage therapy has been increasingly accepted 
by thoracic facet joint disorder patients due to its lower costs, fewer unwanted 
side effects and safety for clinical use. In this systematic review, we aim to 
evaluate the effectiveness and safety of massage therapy for patients with 
thoracic facet joint disorder.
METHODS: We will search the following electronic databases for randomized 
controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of massage therapy in treating 
thoracic facet joint disorder: Wanfang and PubMed Database, CNKI, CENTRAL, 
CINAHL and EMBASE. Each database will be searched from inception to October 
2020. The entire process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of 
bias assessment and meta-analyses.
RESULTS: This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of massage therapy 
for patients with thoracic facet joint disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: This proposed systematic review will evaluate the existing evidence 
on the effectiveness and safety of massage therapy for patients with thoracic 
facet joint disorder.
DISSEMINATION AND ETHICS: The results of this review will be disseminated 
through peer-reviewed publication. Because all of the data used in this 
systematic review and meta-analysis has been published, this review does not 
require ethical approval. Furthermore, all data will be analyzed anonymously 
during the review process.

BACKGROUND: Root extracts of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) are known to 
possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects. An aqueous 
extract of roots plus leaves of this plant has shown to yield higher percentages 
of withanolide glycosides and, accordingly, may possess better analgesic, 
anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects than root alone extracts.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of a standardized aqueous 
extract of roots plus leaves of W. somnifera in patients with knee joint pain 
and discomfort.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients with knee joint pain and discomfort were 
randomized in a double-blind manner to W. somnifera 250 mg, W. somnifera 125 mg 
and placebo, all given twice daily. Assessment was done by Modified WOMAC, Knee 
Swelling Index (KSI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at baseline and at the end of 
4, 8, 12 weeks. Tolerability was assessed by incidence of adverse effects in 
treatment groups. Student's 't' test and ANOVA were used to compare mean change 
from baseline within and between the study groups. A p < 0.05 was considered 
significant.
RESULTS: At the end of 12 weeks, compared to baseline and placebo, significant 
reductions were observed in mean mWOMAC and KSI in W. somnifera 250 mg 
(p < 0.001), W. somnifera 125 mg (p < 0.05) groups. VAS scores for pain, 
stiffness and disability were significantly reduced in W. somnifera 250 mg 
(p < 0.001), W. somnifera 125 mg (p < 0.01) groups. W. somnifera 250 mg group 
showed earliest efficacy (at 4 weeks). All treatments were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the doses of an aqueous extract of W. somnifera produced 
significant reduction in outcome variables, with the 250 mg group showing 
significantly better response. In addition, the therapeutic response appears to 
be dose-dependent and free of any significant GI disturbances.

BACKGROUND: Conservative treatment of acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation 
is not always successful. A consequence of persistent AC joint dislocation may 
be chronic pain and discomfort in the shoulder region as well a sensation of 
constant AC joint instability and impaired shoulder function. Stabilization of 
the AC joint may reduce these sequels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to chronic AC joint dislocation, 39 patients in our 
hospital underwent coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction with autogenous 
semitendinosus and gracilis tendons between May 2005 and April 2011. We examined 
25 patients after a mean of 4.2 years. The outcomes were Constant shoulder Score 
(CS), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), pain (Visual Analog 
Scale, VAS), cross-arm test, stability of the AC joint, and complications. The 
follow-up visits included anteroposterior and axillary radiographs.
RESULTS: Mean CS was 83 in the injured shoulder and 91 in the uninjured shoulder 
(p = 0.002). Mean DASH was 14. In 14 patients, the AC joint was clinically 
stable; pain was minor. In radiographs, osteolysis of the lateral clavicle and 
tunnel widening were markedly common. Fracture of the coracoid process occurred 
in 5 patients, and 3 suffered a fracture of the clavicle; 2 had a postoperative 
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic reconstruction of CC ligaments showed a moderate 
subjective outcome at the 4-year follow-up. After surgery, almost half the AC 
joints failed to stabilize. Lateral clavicle osteolysis and tunnel widening were 
notably common complications.

BACKGROUND: Pelvic posture and kinematics influence acetabular orientation and 
are therefore expected to be involved in the pathomechanics of femoroacetabular 
impingement (FAI). This systematic review aims to determine whether FAI patients 
show pelvic postures or patterns of motion contributing to impingement or, 
conversely, develop compensatory postures and patterns of motion preventing it.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane 
Library were systematically searched to find all the studies that measured 
pelvic positional and/or kinematic data in humans (patients or cadaveric 
specimens) affected by FAI.
RESULTS: Twelve items were selected and grouped according to the main field of 
investigation. No quantitative data synthesis was allowed due to methodological 
heterogeneity. Pelvic posture and kinematics seem to play a relevant role in 
FAI. The patients, especially if symptomatic, show a paradoxical lack of pelvic 
back tilt in standing hip flexions, i.e., in squatting, that enhances 
femoroacetabular engagement. Such an aberrant pattern might depend on a lower 
pelvic incidence. On the contrary, active hip flexion in decubitus elicits a 
compensatory, more pronounced back tilt to facilitate hip flexion without 
impingement. Stair climbing shows a compensatory pattern of augmented pelvic 
axial rotation and augmented peak forward tilt to reduce painful hip motions, 
namely internal rotation and extension.
CONCLUSION: In FAI patients, pelvic posture and kinematics are sometimes an 
expression of compensatory mechanisms developed to reduce pain and discomfort, 
and sometimes an expression of paradoxical responses that further enhance the 
impingement pathomechanism.

Joint pain is a common ailment among adults worldwide. Six men and 14 women 
(aged 51 ± 10 years) with self-reported joint pain were randomly assigned, using 
a cross-over design, to a botanical ointment (Yeahhh Baby!®) or placebo, twice 
daily for 14 days. Subjects completed questionnaires regarding their joint pain 
and discomfort (eg, WOMAC and subjective pain using a visual analog scale [VAS]) 
each evening and underwent a washout period of two weeks before crossing into 
the other condition. Pain and discomfort scores improved for subjects when using 
Yeahhh Baby!® ointment from day 1 to the average of days 2-15. For certain 
measures, similar, albeit insignificant, improvements were noted when subjects 
used the placebo-demonstrating the powerful placebo effect. Specifically, with 
Yeahhh Baby!® ointment, effects were noted for WOMAC pain (P = .008), WOMAC 
physical function (P = .024), WOMAC total (P = .019), and VAS mood interference 
(P = .042). The most pronounced improvement was noted for WOMAC pain (P = .048), 
with a 25% reduction observed with Yeahhh Baby!®, with a 10% reduction noted for 
placebo. These findings indicate that, as compared to a placebo, Yeahhh Baby!® 
ointment may provide relief to individuals suffering from joint pain in their 
knees and/or hips.

INTRODUCTION: There is currently no consensus on the choice between tenotomy and 
tenodesis of the long head of the biceps tendon in rotator cuff repair. The 
Popeye sign is often seen as a drawback of tenotomy. The main objective of the 
present study was to determine the frequency and clinical impact of the Popeye 
sign.
HYPOTHESIS: The Popeye sign is rarely found clinically, and shows little 
functional impact following tenotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center non-randomized prospective study was 
conducted between February and October 2015 in all patients undergoing rotator 
cuff surgery. Patients without surgery on the long head of the biceps tendon 
were excluded. The rate of Popeye sign was assessed 6 months postoperatively. 
Tenotomy patients with and without Popeye sign were compared in terms of pain on 
visual analog scale≤3, gain in range of motion, improvement in subjective 
shoulder value, discomfort or cramps and gain in Constant score.
RESULTS: Seven of the 55 patients included (15.2%) showed postoperative Popeye 
sign. There were no differences between the groups with and without Popeye sign 
on any of the assessment criteria except for a significantly greater improvement 
in mean Constant range of motion score in the Popeye group: gain of 13.8 versus 
3.8 points; p=0.01.
DISCUSSION: The Popeye sign was relatively rarely observed. Functional impact in 
the present study was slight. Longhead of the biceps tenotomy is a justifiable 
treatment option in case of associated rotator cuff tear repair.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, prospective non-randomized.

BACKGROUND: As lumbar spinal stenosis commonly occurs between the L2 and L5 
segments, hip abductors are easily affected. However, studies regarding the gait 
pattern in these patients from the coronal plane have not yet been conducted.
PURPOSE: To determine the effects of lumbar spinal stenosis on the gait pattern 
(stride width and femorotibial angle) and hip abductor surface electromyography 
in varied stride widths compared with healthy individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study.
METHODS: Seventeen patients and 20 healthy individuals were enrolled. Each 
participant completed three gait assessments in their normal gait, adducted gait 
and abducted gait. The femorotibial angle and surface electromyography signals 
were measured. Pain scores was used to quantify the degree of discomfort in the 
gluteal area and medial side of the knee.
RESULTS: When the hip abductors' surface electromyography signals were 
normalized by quadriceps femoris, patients group showed significantly higher 
activation ratios throughout all gait patterns. Generally, surface 
electromyography signals and ratios were significantly higher during abducted 
gait compared with a normal gait. Femorotibial angle became significantly closer 
to the varus in healthy individuals during abducted gait. When femorotibial 
angle during normal gait was compared between the two groups, patients group 
exhibited slightly wider stride width and FTA significantly closer to the varus. 
Pain scores were significantly higher in the patient group and during abducted 
gait.
CONCLUSION: Wider stride widths indicated increased relative activation of the 
hip abductors, closer proximity between femorotibial angle and varus, and 
increased pain scores for discomfort. The same tendency was observed in patients 
group when compared with healthy individuals. Widening of stride width in 
patients group despite abductor weakness suggests that additional muscle 
recruitment may be needed to maintain balance. Furthermore, such a distinctive 
gait pattern exerts increased loading on the medial knee, relating to the 
escalated risk of degenerative knee osteoarthritis.

INTRODUCTION: Posterior radiocapitellar synovial plica excision is sometimes 
performed for lateral epicondylitis after debridement of the extensor carpi 
radialis brevis (ECRB) tendon. We describe a rare intra-articular abnormality of 
the posterior radiocapitellar joint diagnosed on posterior arthroscopic 
observation.
CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man presented with posterolateral pain and discomfort 
in his left elbow. A diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis was made, and 
arthroscopic debridement of the ECRB tendon was performed. Posterior 
arthroscopic examination revealed a tendon-like abnormality running 
longitudinally along the articular surface of the capitulum of the humerus. The 
abnormality was resected using a shaver, and symptoms improved postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: In patients with posterolateral pain and discomfort or catching of 
the elbow, posterior arthroscopic confirmation of the intra-articular structure 
is recommended after debridement of the ECRB tendon.

To review and synthesize the biomechanical effects of valgus knee bracing for 
patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA). Electronic databases were 
searched from their inception to May 2014. Two reviewers independently 
determined study eligibility, rated study quality and extracted data. Where 
possible, data were combined into meta-analyses and pooled estimates with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for standardized mean differences (SMD) were 
calculated. Thirty studies were included with 478 subjects tested while using a 
valgus knee brace. Various biomechanical methods suggested valgus braces can 
decrease direct measures of medial knee compressive force, indirect measures 
representing the mediolateral distribution of load across the knee, 
quadriceps/hamstring and quadriceps/gastrocnemius co-contraction ratios, and 
increase medial joint space during gait. Meta-analysis from 17 studies suggested 
a statistically significant decrease in the external knee adduction moment (KAM) 
during walking, with a moderate-to-high effect size (SMD = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39, 
0.83; P < 0.001). Meta-regression identified a near-significant association for 
the KAM effect size and duration of brace use only (β, -0.01; 95% CI: -0.03, 
0.0001; P = 0.06); with longer durations of brace use associated with smaller 
treatment effects. Minor complications were commonly reported during brace use 
and included slipping, discomfort and poor fit, blisters and skin irritation. 
Systematic review and meta-analysis suggests valgus knee braces can alter knee 
joint loads through a combination of mechanisms, with moderate-to-high effect 
sizes in biomechanical outcomes.

We reported a case of Clostridium bifermentans (C. bifermentans) infection in 
the prosthetic knee joint of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient, who 
presented with swelling, discomfort, pain, and redness in the right lower 
extremity. An uncommon yet potentially lethal human illness triggered by C. 
bifermentans. Foreign material is especially susceptible to local infection 
because of the local immunodeficiency close to the implant. Intravenous (IV) 
cefepime and IV ampicillin/sulbactam were administered to the patient. The idea 
of performing surgery to eradicate the infection was under consideration, but 
its necessity remained uncertain, and the decision to proceed with surgery had 
not been finalized.

Calcium fructoborate (CFB) at a dose of 110 mg twice per day was previously 
reported to improve knee discomfort during the first 14 days of treatment. In 
this study, 60 participants with self-reported knee discomfort were randomized 
into two groups receiving CFB or placebo. Initial levels of knee discomfort were 
evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) 
and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores at the beginning of the study and 
also at 7 and 14 days after treatment. Results showed that supplementation with 
CFB significantly improved knee discomfort in the study subjects; significant 
reductions of mean within-subject change in WOMAC and MPQ scores were observed 
for the CFB group compared to the placebo group at both 7 and 14 days after 
treatment. Estimated treatment differences for the MPQ score were -5.8 
(P=0.0009) and -8.9 (P<0.0001) at Day 7 and 14, respectively. Estimated 
differences for the WOMAC score were -5.3 (P=0.06) and -13.73 (P<0.0001) at Day 
7 and 14, respectively. Negative values indicate greater reductions in reported 
discomfort. On both Day 7 and Day 14, the trend was toward greater improvement 
in the CFB group. The placebo group did not exhibit any change in the WOMAC and 
MPQ scores. In conclusion, supplementation with 110 mg CFB twice per day was 
associated with improving knee discomfort during the 2 weeks of intake.

Management of type 3 acromioclavicular joint dislocations--current 
controversies.

Kim S, Blank A, Strauss E.

AC (acromioclavicular) joint dislocations are a common injury seen by 
physicians. Symptoms range from minor discomfort with activity to complete 
disability of the extremity. Although most orthopaedic surgeons agree on how to 
treat either mild (type 1-2) or severe (type 4-6) injuries, there is no 
consensus for treatment of type 3 injuries. This article reviews the relevant 
literature pertaining to the anatomy of the injury, evaluation of the patient, 
pertinent imaging as well as the controversial management of type 3 AC joint 
dislocations. With improvement in surgical techniques over the past 30 years, 
there have been many published studies evaluating both operative and 
non-operative care. Surgery has shown dramatic improvement in patient-rated 
outcomes; however, it is not always without complications. These risks in some 
patients may not be worth the potential surgical benefits. In type 3 AC joint 
injuries each patient and pathology must be carefully analyzed to ensure that 
the correct treatment option is chosen.

Background: Knee joint pain is the most common reason for physical disability 
which associates with age. TamaFlexTM (NXT15906F6) is a synergistic 
anti-inflammatory formulation which contains ethanol/aqueous extracts of 
Tamarindus indica seeds and ethanol extract of Curcuma longa rhizome. Methods: 
In a 90-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated 
efficacy of NXT15906F6 in relieving pain and improving joint function in 
non-arthritic adults. Ninety non-arthritic subjects who experienced knee pain 
and joint discomfort following a six-minute walk test (SMWT) and Stair climb 
test (SCT) participated in the present trial. Subjects received either 250 mg 
(n=30) or 400 mg (n=30) of NXT15906F6 or matched placebo (PL: n=30) daily for 90 
days. Improvement from baseline six-minute walk distance (SMWD) in NXT15906F6 
groups, compared with placebo (PL) was the primary outcome of the study. 
Results: At post-intervention, subjects in NXT15906F6-250 (p<0.001) and 
NXT15906F6-400 (p<0.0001) groups showed substantial improvements in mean changes 
of SMWD from baseline compared to placebo. The 250 mg and 400 mg NXT15906F6 
groups also improved average walking speed from baseline by 0.08±0.07 m/s 
(p=0.0010) and 0.11±0.08 m/s (p<0.0001), respectively. The NXT15906F6 groups 
experienced significant improvement in SMWT performances as early as 14 days. 
NXT15906F6-supplemented participants showed a consistent benefit of pain relief 
and improved musculoskeletal functions, compared to placebo. Conclusion: 
NXT15906F6 provided substantial relief from knee pain after physical activity 
and improved joint function in non-arthritic adults. Study participants did not 
show any major adverse events, and they tolerated well this novel herbal 
formulation.

PURPOSE: The increase in tablet usage allows people to perform computer work in 
non-traditional office environments. The aim of this study was to assess the 
effects of changes in tablet keyboard design on postures of the upper 
extremities and neck, discomfort, and usability under different usage positions 
during prolonged touch-typing.
METHODS: Eighteen healthy participants familiar with touch-screen devices were 
randomized into three usage positions (desk, lap, and bed) and completed six, 
60-minute typing sessions using three virtual keyboard designs (standard, wide, 
split). Electrogoniometers continuously measured the postures of the wrists, 
elbow, and neck. Body discomfort and system usability were evaluated by 
questionnaires before and immediately after each typing session.
RESULTS: Separate linear mixed effects models on various postural measures and 
subjective ratings are conducted with usage position as the between-subject 
factors, keyboard design and typing duration as the with-in subject factors were 
conducted. Using the tablet in bed led to more extended wrists but a more 
natural elbow flexion than the desk position. The angled split virtual keyboard 
significantly reduced the extent of wrist ulnar deviation than the keyboard with 
either standard or wide design. However, little difference was observed across 
the usage position and keyboard design. When the postural data were compared 
between the middle and end of typing sessions, the wrists, elbow, and neck all 
exhibited a substantially increased range of joint movements (13% to 38%). The 
discomfort rating also increased significantly over time in every upper body 
region investigated. Additionally, the split keyboard design received a higher 
usability rating in the bed position, whereas participants had more satisfactory 
experience while using the wide keyboard in the traditional desk setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged use of tablets in non-traditional office environments may 
result in awkward postures in the upper body that may expose users to greater 
risks of developing musculoskeletal symptoms. Adequate virtual keyboard designs 
show the potential to alleviate some postural effects and improve the user 
experience without changing the tablet form factors.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common focal peripheral neuropathy. Increased 
pressure in the carpal tunnel results in median nerve compression and impaired 
nerve perfusion, leading to discomfort and paresthesia in the affected hand. 
Surgical division of the transverse carpal ligament is preferred in severe cases 
of CTS and should be considered when conservative measures fail. A through 
knowledge of the normal and variant anatomy of the median nerve in the wrist is 
fundamental in avoiding complications during carpal tunnel release. This paper 
aims to briefly review the anatomic variations of the median nerve in the carpal 
tunnel and its implications in carpal tunnel surgery.

BACKGROUND: Atlantoaxial dislocation usually results in sudden death. The 
patient had never found any axial lesion before, and the atlantoaxial joint 
dislocation was caused by rotation of the neck due to discomfort of the neck. 
The patient was given surgical treatment after the rescue of respiratory and 
cardiac arrest during transportation, which was extremely rare and rarely 
reported.
METHODS: A 62-year-old male patient presented with limited cervical mobility 
after a violent rotation of the neck due to neck discomfort. X-ray and computed 
tomography (CT) scan suggested atlantoaxial dislocation. Sudden respiratory and 
cardiac arrest during transportation was immediately followed by continuous 
cranial traction and successful occipital and neck fusion operation.
RESULTS: After the successful rescue of endotracheal intubation, the patient was 
given continuous cranial traction. After the completion of CT scan, the patient 
was given occipital neck fusion, and 6 days after the surgery, the patient wore 
the skull-neck-thorax brace and walked freely.
CONCLUSION: Continuous cranial traction and posterior occipitocervical fusion 
are effective methods for treating axial pathological fracture with atlantoaxial 
dislocation.

Septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is rare, but patients with 
this diagnosis are at high risk for significant morbidity. We present a case of 
a 15-year-old man who presented with increasing trismus for 3 days. He had only 
minimal discomfort and swelling of the right cheek and temporal region, and 
pericoronitis of an impacted wisdom tooth was suspected. Under intravenous 
antibiotics, pain subsided, but trismus and a slight swelling remained. CT scan 
showed septic arthritis of the TMJ with an abscess formation penetrating into 
the epidural space. Immediate drainage and craniotomy were performed. Under 
intravenous antibiotics, the patient made a full recovery. The source of 
infection remained undetermined. To our knowledge, this is the first reported 
case of septic arthritis of the TMJ spreading into the epidural space.

During the field operation of rice combine harvester, the vibration generated by 
vibration component will only reduce mechanical reliability and yield, but also 
cause resonance in the human body, leading to a decrease in driving comfort and 
even damage to the driver's health. To study the impact of combine harvester 
vibration on driving comfort, a certain type of tracked rice combine harvester 
was selected as the research object, and vibration tests were carried out based 
on vibration source analysis in the driving cab during field harvesting 
operations. The study showed that under the influence of field road conditions 
and crop flow, the operating speed of the engine, threshing rotor, stirrer, 
cutting blade, threshing cylinder, vibration sieve and conveyor were 
fluctuating, and their rotation and reciprocating motion would produce vibration 
excitation in the driving cab. A spectrum analysis was conducted on the 
acceleration signal of the driver's cab, and it was found that vibration 
frequencies at three measuring points, namely the pedal, control lever, and 
seat, can reach up to 36.7~43.3 Hz. These frequencies can cause resonance in 
various parts of the driver's body, such as the head and lower limbs, leading to 
symptoms such as dizziness, throat discomfort, leg pain, defecation anxiety, and 
frequent urination, and even affect vision of the driver. At the same time, a 
weighted root-mean-square acceleration evaluation method was used to evaluate 
the driving comfort of the harvester. The evaluation method showed that the 
vibration at the foot pedal (Aw1 = 4.4 m/s2>2.5 m/s2) caused extreme discomfort, 
while the vibration at the seat (0.5 m/s2< Aw2 = 0.67 m/s2<1.0 m/s2) and the 
control lever (0.5 m/s2< Aw3 = 0.55 m/s2<1.0 m/s2) caused relatively less 
discomfort. This research can provide some reference for the optimization design 
of the joint harvester driver's cab.

Radiographic osteolysis after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) remains a 
challenging clinical entity, as it may not initially manifest clinically 
apparent symptoms but can lead to clinically important complications, such as 
aseptic loosening. A thorough consideration of medical history and physical 
examination is essential to rule out other causes of symptomatic TSA-namely, 
periprosthetic joint infection-as symptoms often progress to vague pain or 
discomfort due to subtle component loosening. Once confirmed, nonoperative 
treatment of osteolysis should first be pursued given the potential to avoid 
surgery-associated risks. If needed, the current surgical options include 
glenoid polyethylene revision and conversion to reverse shoulder arthroplasty. 
The current article provides a comprehensive review of the evaluation and 
management of osteolysis after TSA through an evidence-based discussion of 
current concepts.

BACKGROUND: As a complication of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), patella tendon 
disruption has been scarcely reported. Moreover, combined periprosthetic joint 
infection with patellar tendon disruption is even rare. This is a case report on 
successful treatment of a recurred periprosthetic joint infection accompanying 
the patellar tendon disruption after revision of TKA.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old woman presented with pain and exudate in the 
right knee. she had a history of two-stage revision TKA at another hospital for 
periprosthetic joint infection of right knee. With repeated incision and 
debridement, Achromobacter xylosoxidan was identified in samples collected from 
deep tissue. Therefore, two-stage revision TKA was performed. Intra-operatively, 
a complete defect of the patellar tendon was observed. Re-revision TKA was 
performed as a routine of two-stage revision of TKA for periprosthetic joint 
infection. Reconstruction of the patellar tendon defect was performed using an 
Achilles tendon-bone block allograft. Stability of allograft was confirmed at 30 
degrees of flexion, and excellent implant placement was confirmed by 
postoperative radiographs. At the final follow-up 3 years after surgery, 
evidence of infectious sign was absent, and the range of flexion up to 120 
degrees was recovered without extension lag. Normal locomotive gait was 
restored, and recreational activities previously performed were possible without 
discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Proper reconstruction of extensor mechanism was achieved by 
patellar wrapping technique using an Achilles tendon-bone block allograft.

BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a painful musculoskeletal 
condition, which is characterised by knee pain located in the anterior aspect 
(front) and retropatellar region (behind) of the knee joint. Various 
non-operative interventions are suggested for the treatment of this condition. 
Knee orthoses (knee braces, sleeves, straps or bandages) are worn over the knee 
and are thought to help reduce knee pain. They can be used in isolation or in 
addition to other treatments such as exercise or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medications.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of knee orthoses (knee 
braces, sleeves, straps or bandages) for treating PFPS.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register (11 May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015 Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 8 May 
2015), EMBASE (1980 to 2015 Week 18), SPORTDiscus (1985 to 11 May 2015), AMED 
(1985 to 8 May 2015), CINAHL (1937 to 11 May 2015), PEDro (1929 to June 2015), 
trial registries and conference proceedings.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials 
evaluating knee orthoses for treating people with PFPS. Our primary outcomes 
were pain and function.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies 
for eligibility, assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated 
mean differences (MD) or, where pooling data from different scales, standardised 
mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous 
outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs for binary outcomes. We pooled data 
using the fixed-effect model.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (one of which was quasi-randomised) that 
reported results for 368 people who had PFPS. Participants were recruited from 
health clinics in three trials and were military recruits undergoing training in 
the other two trials. Although no trials recruited participants who were 
categorised as elite or professional athletes, military training does comprise 
intensive exercise regimens. All five trials were at high risk of bias, 
including performance bias reflecting the logistical problems in these trials of 
blinding of participants and care providers. As assessed using the GRADE 
approach, the available evidence for all reported outcomes is 'very low' 
quality. This means that we are very uncertain about the results.The trials 
covered three different types of comparison: knee orthosis and exercises versus 
exercises alone; one type of orthosis versus another; and knee orthosis versus 
exercises. No trials assessed the mode of knee orthosis use, such as whether the 
orthosis was worn all day or only during physical activity. Two trials had two 
groups; two trials had three groups; and one trial had four groups.All five 
trials compared a knee orthosis (knee sleeve, knee brace, or patellar strap) 
versus a 'no treatment' control group, with all participants receiving 
exercises, either through a military training programme or a home-based exercise 
programme. There is very low quality evidence of no clinically important 
differences between the two groups in short-term (2 to 12 weeks follow-up) knee 
pain based on the visual analogue scale (0 to 10 points; higher scores mean 
worse pain): MD -0.46 favouring knee orthoses, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.24; P = 0.19; 
234 participants, 3 trials). A similar lack of clinically important difference 
was found for knee function (183 participants, 2 trials). None of the trials 
reported on quality of life measures, resource use or participant satisfaction. 
Although two trials reported on the impact on sporting or occupational 
participation, one trial (35 participants) did not provide data split by 
treatment group on the resumption of sport activity and the other reported only 
on abandonment of military training due to knee pain (both cases were allocated 
a knee orthosis). One trial (59 participants, 84 affected knees) recording only 
adverse events in the two knee orthoses (both were knee sleeves) groups, 
reported 16 knees (36% of 44 knees) had discomfort or skin abrasion.Three trials 
provided very low quality evidence on single comparisons of different types of 
knee orthoses: a knee brace versus a knee sleeve (63 participants), a patella 
strap with a knee sleeve (31 participants), and a knee sleeve with a patellar 
ring versus a knee sleeve only (44 knees). None of three trials found an 
important difference between the two types of knee orthosis in pain. One trial 
found no clinically important difference in function between a knee brace and a 
knee sleeve. None of the three trials reported on quality of life, resource use 
or participant satisfaction. One trial comparing a patella strap with a knee 
sleeve reported that both participants quitting military training due to knee 
pain were allocated a knee sleeve. One poorly reported trial found three times 
as many knees with adverse effects (discomfort or skin abrasion) in those given 
knee sleeves with a patella ring than those given knee sleeves only.One trial 
compared a knee orthosis (knee brace) with exercise (66 participants). It found 
very low quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two 
intervention groups in pain or knee function. The trial did not report on 
quality of life, impact on sporting or occupational participation, resource use, 
participant satisfaction or complications.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review has found a lack of evidence to 
inform on the use of knee orthoses for treating PFPS. There is, however, very 
low quality evidence from clinically heterogeneous trials using different types 
of knee orthoses (knee brace, sleeve and strap) that using a knee orthosis did 
not reduce knee pain or improve knee function in the short term (under three 
months) in adults who were also undergoing an exercise programme for treating 
PFPS. This points to the need for good-quality clinically-relevant research to 
inform on the use of commonly-available knee orthoses for treating PFPS.

BACKGROUND: Medial epicondyle fractures are one of the more common humerus 
fractures, but humeral medial condyle fracture (HMCF) is rare. Nonunion of 
medial humeral condyle fractures due to functional exercise is less common.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 5-year-old patient with a nonunion HMCF due to 
excessive functional exercise, who bruised the elbow 1 year ago and had no 
positive findings on all imaging studies. On this physical examination, there 
was a snapping and palpable lump in the elbow joint during movement, but the 
patient did not feel any discomfort and the range of motion of the joint was 
normal. X rays and computed tomography (CT) showed that the left HMCF was 
discontinuous, the broken ends were dislocated, and the joint alignment was 
poor. Open reduction (OR) and screw fixation was used during the operation, and 
the patient recovered well at 3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The rarity and low radiographic appearance of displaced HMCF are 
easily overlooked and can eventually lead to nonunion HMCF, especially when 
radiographically difficult to visualize before age 5 years. Therefore, 
regardless of whether there are signs or imaging abnormalities in the growth 
process of adolescents, they should be vigilant, shorten the time interval for 
re-examination, and early detection and timely treatment can avoid some 
complications caused by this.

Elastofibroma dorsi is an uncommon, benign, slow-growing soft-tissue tumour of 
uncertain aetiology. It classically presents as an ill-defined mass at the 
inferior pole of the scapula with symptoms which include swelling, discomfort, 
snapping, stiffness and occasionally pain. We report the symptoms, function and 
outcome after treatment of 21 elastofibromas in 15 patients. All were diagnosed 
by MRI and early in the series four also underwent CT-guided biopsy to confirm 
the diagnosis. In all, 18 tumours were excised and three were observed. After 
excision, the mean visual analogue score for pain decreased from 4.6 (0 to 10) 
pre-operatively to 2.4 (0 to 8) post-operatively (p = 0.04). The mean shoulder 
function, at a mean follow-up of 4.2 years (3 months to 16 years), was 78.1% (30 
to 100) using the Stanmore percentage of normal shoulder assessment scoring 
system. The mean range of forward flexion improved from 135 degrees (70 degrees 
to 180 degrees ) to 166 degrees (100 degrees to 180 degrees ) after excision (p 
= 0.005). In four patients a post-operative haematoma formed; one required 
evacuation. Three patients developed a post-operative seroma requiring needle 
aspiration and one developed a superficial infection which was treated with 
antibiotics. Our findings support previous reports suggesting that a 
pre-operative tissue diagnosis is not necessary in most cases since the lesion 
can be confidently diagnosed by MRI, when interpreted in the light of 
appropriate clinical findings. Surgical excision in symptomatic patients, is 
helpful. It has been suggested that elastofibroma is caused by a local tissue 
reaction and is not a true neoplastic process. A strong association has been 
noted between elastofibroma and repetitive use of the shoulder, which is 
supported by our findings.

Gout is a metabolic disease characterized by recurrent episodes of acute 
arthritis. Gout has been reported in many locations but is rarely localized in 
the shoulder joint.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man who visited an outpatient clinic with the 
main complaint of a right shoulder ache lasting 2 weeks came to our attention. 
The patient reports his discomfort as being of an unbearable character, 
happening largely at night and preventing him from falling asleep. In the 
previous 6 months, he had two episodes of the same ailment that lasted around 
3-5 days each and spontaneously resolved. Due to the pain's continuance without 
improvement, the patient now seeks medical assistance. Gout with right shoulder 
involvement was identified as the cause. Prednisolone 40 mg/day for 10 days, 
allopurinol 300 mg/day, and colchicine 0.5 mg/day were all prescribed for the 
patient. After 6 months of follow-up, the patient had significantly improved.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The condition of gout affecting the shoulder joint 
is quite rare. According to past medical history and clinical manifestations, 
doctors and orthopedic surgeons should take gouty shoulder arthritis into 
consideration when there is serious erosion.

BACKGROUND: Snapping fingers resulting from flexor tendon tenosynovitis at the 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, is common. However lateral band snapping 
syndrome (LPSS) in the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) are extremely rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old female was diagnosed with LPSS in the PIPJ of 
fifth finger which was confirmed by dynamic evaluation upon ultrasound. Repair 
of retinacular ligament of the extensor tendon was performed. At the six-month 
follow up, the patient had regained full ROM with no discomfort, without 
evidence of recurrence.
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of LPSS at the PIPJ is challenging. Dynamic evaluation 
of the extensor tendon over PIPJ is necessary to diagnose LBSS. Ultrasound was 
used to assess the movement of the lateral band of the extensor tendon when the 
fingers flexed and to demonstrate dynamically the snapping and subluxation of 
the lateral band, so as to facilitate confirming the diagnosis of LBSS.
CONCLUSION: Given clinical suspicion of LBSS, we recommend ultrasonography as a 
feasible tool to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with LBSS may thus benefit from 
prompt repair of the retinacular ligament without sequela.

Osteochondromas are usually extra-articular lesions originating from the 
metaphysis of long bones. Intra-articular osteochondromas may also occur, 
causing pain and discomfort and restricting the range of motion. Osteochondromas 
of the femoral neck are intra-articular lesions that are difficult to access for 
surgical resection, particularly when located posteriorly. We herein present a 
rare case of an intra-articular osteochondroma involving the posteroinferior 
aspect of the femoral neck associated with secondary synovial 
osteochondromatosis (SOC) of the hip joint in a 25-year-old woman. Determining 
the optimal treatment was difficult due to the high risk of avascular necrosis 
(AVN) following surgical excision. The patient was successfully treated with 
arthroscopic surgery and she remained in good condition at 2 years 
postoperatively, with a full range of motion of the hip joint, and without signs 
of limping, recurrence of the SOC, or AVN of the femoral head.

To assess the variability in accuracy of contrast media introduction, leakage, 
required time and patient discomfort in four different centres, each using a 
different image-guided glenohumeral injection technique. Each centre included 25 
consecutive patients. The ultrasound-guided anterior (USa) and posterior 
approach (USp), fluoroscopic-guided anterior (FLa) and posterior (FLp) approach 
were used. Number of injection attempts, effect of contrast leakage on 
diagnostic quality, and total room, radiologist and procedure times were 
measured. Pain was documented with a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score. 
Access to the joint was achieved in all patients. A successful first attempt 
significantly occurred more often with US (94%) than with fluoroscopic guidance 
(72%). Leakage of contrast medium did not cause interpretative difficulties. 
With US guidance mean room, procedure and radiologist times were significantly 
shorter (p < 0.001). The USa approach was rated with the lowest pre- and 
post-injection VAS scores. The four image-guided injection techniques are 
successful in injection of contrast material into the glenohumeral joint. 
US-guided injections and especially the anterior approach are significantly less 
time consuming, more successful on the first attempt, cause less patient 
discomfort and obviate the need for radiation and iodine contrast.

A 77-year-old woman presented with a mucous cyst on the lateral aspect of the 
interphalangeal joint of the first toe caused by contact pressure with the 
second toe from hallux valgus. She complained of discomfort and discharge from 
the left first toe for approximately 4 months. Physical examination showed the 
second toe pressing strongly against the first toe due to hallux valgus and 
discharge from the skin on the lateral aspect of the interphalangeal joint of 
the first toe. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion at the same 
level. The patient underwent a modified scarf osteotomy of the first metatarsal 
for hallux valgus to resolve the contact pressure between the toes-considered 
the cause of the mucous cyst-and resection of mucous cyst. Forefoot weight 
bearing was allowed 6 weeks after surgery. As of 1 year after surgery, she has 
had no recurrence of the cyst. The score on the Japanese Society for Surgery of 
the Foot hallux metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale improved from 59/100 
points to 92/100. This outcome suggests that hallux valgus correction should be 
considered when a mucous cyst is associated with contact pressure due to a 
hallux valgus deformity. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous 
reports of a mucous cyst caused by contact pressure between the first toe and 
second toe due to hallux valgus.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations between cumulative occupational 
physical load (COPL) and 3 definitions of knee osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were performed from 2 population-based cohorts 
(n = 327). Eligible symptomatic participants were those with pain, aching, or 
discomfort in or around the knee on most days of a month at any time in the past 
and any pain in the past 12 months. Asymptomatic participants responded "no" to 
both knee pain questions. Self-reported COPL was calculated over each 
participant's lifetime and then categorized into quarters (QCOPL). Radiographic 
OA (ROA) and symptomatic OA (SOA) were defined by Kellgren/Lawrence grade ≥2, 
with SOA also including pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) OA was defined 
using criteria by Hunter et al. Logistic regression, adjusted with population 
weights, examined the associations between QCOPL and each of ROA, SOA, and 
MRI-OA after controlling for covariates and two-way interactions.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean ± SD age of 58.5 ± 11.0 years and a mean ± SD 
body mass index of 26.3 ± 4.7 kg/m(2) . Of those, 109 (33.3%) had ROA, 102 
(31.2%) had SOA, and 131 (40.1%) had MRI-OA. Compared with QCOPL-1, increased 
odds of ROA were found for QCOPL-4 (odds ratio [OR] 3.15, 95% confidence 
interval [95% CI] 1.02-9.70) and QCOPL-3 (OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.55-11.34). 
Statistically significant relationships were found in SOA (QCOPL-4: OR 8.16, 95% 
CI 1.89-35.27; QCOPL-3: OR 5.73, 95% CI 1.36-24.12) and MRI-OA (QCOPL-4: OR 
9.54, 95% CI 2.65-34.27; QCOPL-3: OR 9.04, 95% CI 2.65-30.88; QCOPL-2: OR 7.18, 
95% CI 2.17-23.70).
CONCLUSION: Occupational activity is associated with knee OA, with dose-response 
relationships observed in SOA and MRI-OA.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) is 
highly correlated with the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). 
However, these studies failed to present a causal relationship. Thus, we aimed 
to performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate causality 
between BMI and TMDs.
METHODS: We performed a two-sample bidirectional MR analysis using large-scale 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Data were obtained from a large-scale 
BMI dataset (N = 322,154), TMDs dataset (N = 134,280). The causal effects were 
estimated with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, MR Egger, weighted 
median. Sensitivity analyses were implemented with Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger 
intercept test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analysis and the funnel plot.
RESULTS: In the forward MR analysis, a genetic prediction of low BMI was 
causally associated with a higher risk of TMDs (IVW OR: 0.575, 95% CI: 
0.415-0.798, p: 0.001). Similar results were obtained using other complementary 
methods (MR Egger OR: 0.270, 95% CI: 0.104-0.698, p: 0.009; weighted median OR: 
0.496, 95% CI: 0.298-0.826, p: 0.007). In the reverse MR results, TMDs was shown 
to have no significant effect on BMI (all p > 0.05). No pleiotropy and 
heterogeneity were detected in the bidirectional analysis (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A lower BMI might be causally associated with increased risk of 
TMDs, supporting the importance of weight control for the prevention of TMDs. 
Clinicians should pay more attention to the low-BMI patients among those seeking 
medical advice due to temporomandibular joint discomfort.

OBJECTIVES: Joint injuries frequently lead to progressive joint degeneration 
that causes articular disc derangement, joint inflammation, and osteoarthritis. 
Such arthropathies that arise after trauma are defined as post-traumatic 
arthritis (PTA). Although PTA is well recognized in knee and elbow joints, PTA 
in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has not been clearly defined. 
Interestingly, patients experiencing head and neck trauma without direct jaw 
fracture have displayed TMJ disease symptoms; however, definitive diagnosis and 
treatment options are not available. This study will analyze clinical aspects of 
PTA in TMJ and their treatment outcomes after joint arthrocentesis and lavage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with history of trauma to the head and 
neck especially without jaw fracture were retrospectively studied. Those 
patients developed TMJ disease symptoms and were diagnosed by computed 
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. To decrease TMJ discomfort, 
arthrocentesis and lavage with or without conservative therapy were applied, and 
efficacy was evaluated by amount of mouth opening and pain scale. Statistical 
differences between pre- and post-treatment values were evaluated by Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test.
RESULTS: Patient age varied widely between 20 and 80 years, and causes of trauma 
were diverse. Duration of disease onset was measured as 508 posttrauma days, and 
85% of the patients sought clinic visit within 2 years after trauma. In 
addition, 85% of the patients showed TMJ disc derangement without reduction, and 
osteoarthritis was accompanied at the traumatized side or at both sides in 40% 
of the patients. After arthrocentesis or lavage, maximal mouth opening was 
significantly increased (28-44 mm on average, P<0.001) and pain scale was 
dramatically decreased (7.8-3.5 of 10, P<0.001); however, concomitant 
conservative therapy showed no difference in treatment outcome.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study clarify the disease identity of PTA in TMJ 
and suggest early diagnosis and treatment options to manage PTA in TMJ.

Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Sacroiliac pain is one of the causes of low back pain, representing 
with discomfort and tenderness in the sacroiliac joint. Interventional 
procedures might be beneficial in cases unresponsive to medical treatments. 
Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of intra-articular corticosteroid 
injections in patients with sacroiliac pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a clinical trial performed in 2017-2018 in 
Kashani Hospital, Isfahan, on patients with low back pain and formerly diagnosed 
with sacroiliac pain. Patients were recruited based on inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Corticosteroid injections were performed for patients. Patients were 
visited within 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 months after interventions, and pain and 
disabilities of patients were assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) 
and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total number of 27 patients entered our clinical trial. We showed 
that the mean NRS score among patients before interventions was 8.01 ± 0.96. 
Assessments of disability score also indicated that the mean disability scores 
was 41.48 ± 7.48. Our data also indicated that there was a significant reducing 
trend in both NRS and disability score after interventions (P < 0.001 for both 
items).
CONCLUSION: Intra-articular steroid injection is associated with significantly 
reduced pain and disability in patients with sacroiliac pain. Previous studies 
evaluated variable methods and reported that this method has high values and 
significant advantages compared with other techniques which were in line with 
our results.

INTRODUCTION: Lipomas are the most common type of soft-tissue tumor, but 
intra-articular lipomas are very rare. Most cases occur in the knee joint. This 
is a report of intra-articular lipoma in the knee joint, 8 months after removal 
with good post-operative outcome.
CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old female who presented soft-tissue mass on her right 
knee. She felt uncomfortable but not in pain. The mass grew gradually and she 
wanted to be surgically removed. The mass was too large (5 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm) to 
be removed endoscopically, so arthrotomy was made. The mass was true lipoma 
histologically. She is living happily without recurrence after surgery.
CONCLUSION: We have described an intra-articular synovial lipoma in the knee of 
a middle-aged female. Intra-articular lipomas are very rare. The tumor in this 
case was relatively large but painless, and the chief complaint was discomfort. 
It grew gradually, so the removal was performed. At present, the patient is 
living happy without recurrence after surgery.

Goats or sheep are the preferred animal model for the preclinical evaluation of 
cartilage repair techniques due to the similarity of the goat stifle joint to 
the human knee. The medial femoral condyle of the stifle joint is the preferred 
site for the assessment of articular cartilage repair, as this is the primary 
location for this type of lesion in the human knee. Proper surgical exposure of 
the medial femoral condyle is paramount to obtain reproducible results without 
surgical error. When applying the standard human medial arthrotomy technique on 
the goat stifle joint, there are some key aspects to consider in order to 
prevent destabilization of the extensor apparatus and subsequent postoperative 
patellar dislocations with associated animal discomfort. This paper describes a 
modified surgical technique to approach the medial femoral condyle of the 
caprine stifle joint. The modified technique led to satisfactory exposure 
without postoperative incidence of patellar luxations and no long-term adverse 
effects on the joint.

Despite recent research on joint motion measurement to monitor human body 
movement, current measurement techniques and tools have significant limitations, 
including requiring large space for measurement and causing discomfort in test 
subjects wearing motion sensors. Our study aims, first, to develop carbon 
nanotube (CNT)-based textile joint motion sensors. Second, ours study aims to 
identify the most suitable CNT-based sensor structure and attachment method for 
use on a wearable platform during general exercise speeds. Lastly, we used these 
sensors on the human body, using sleeves and legs to find the most stable 
location, and we used the CNT-based sensor condition to monitor joint motions. 
We utilized our CNT-based sensor, which has proper elasticity as well as 
conductivity, and applied it to the elbow and knee joints. Based on the strain 
gauge principle, we monitored the variance of electric resistance that occurred 
when the CNT-based sensor was stretched due to limb motion. Our study tested 48 
types of sensors. These sensors were applied to the CNT using different base 
knit textiles as well as different attachment methods, layers, sensor lengths, 
and sensor widths. The four most successful sensor types, which showed superior 
efficacy over the others in joint motion measurement, were selected for further 
study. These four sensors were then used to measure the elbow and knee joint 
motions of human subjects by placing them on different locations on sleeves and 
legs. The CNT knit textile sensors best suited to measuring joint motions are 
those with a double-layered CNT knit and 5 cm long × 0.5 cm or 1 cm wide sensors 
attached to a polyester¬-based knit using a welding method. The best position 
for the sensor to more stably monitor joint motions was the "below hinge 
position" from the elbow or knee hinge joint. Our study suggests an alternative 
strategy for joint-motion measurement that could contribute to the development 
of more comfortable and human-friendly methods of human limb motion measurement.

Tuberculosis (TB) of the medial epicondyle of the humerus represents a rare 
etiology of chronic pain, swelling, and restricted mobility of the elbow joint, 
characterized by a gradual progression of the swelling. The paucity of reported 
cases in the literature attests to their infrequency. Herein, we present a case 
that was referred to our department after enduring swelling, restricted 
movement, and discomfort for a period of one year. The patient underwent a 
thorough clinical evaluation, followed by debridement, which ultimately resulted 
in the diagnosis of TB of the medial epicondyle of the humerus. In this ensuing 
case report, we comprehensively describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, 
and treatment approach employed for this uncommon manifestation of TB affecting 
the elbow joint.

BACKGROUND: Crescent fractures are a subset of lateral compression injuries 
associated with high energy trauma and are rotationally unstable. These 
fractures are rare bilaterally, and we present one such rare case of a bilateral 
crescent fracture.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old male presented with run-over injury and was 
diagnosed with bilateral crescent fracture-dislocation of the Sacroiliac joint. 
He was stabilized hemodynamically and then operated with iliosacral screws and 
reconstruction plates. The fracture united, and the patient is doing his daily 
activities without discomfort at follow up of 1 year after fracture fixation.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral pelvic crescent fractures are rare and need optimization 
and fixation for improved functional outcomes. It is necessary to evaluate 
associated injuries.

Postoperative urinary retention necessitating catheterization after major lower 
limb arthroplasty surgery adds to the patients' postoperative discomfort and 
increases the risk of urinary tract infection with potential risk of transient 
bacteraemia and seeding of infection to prosthetic joints. Preoperative 
evaluation of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms may help to identify 
at-risk patients and the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) has been 
used as a screening tool to quantify the severity of symptoms in males. A 
prospective cohort of 303 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty was 
evaluated using the IPSS. Patients were categorized into three symptom groups 
(mild, moderate and severe based on scores of 0-7, 8-18 and greater than 18, 
respectively) and four age groups (<50 years, 51-60 years, 61-70 years and 
greater than 70 years). Twenty-six patients (8.6%) developed urinary retention 
and were catheterized postoperatively; of these, 16 were male and 10 were 
female. Statistical analysis using logistic regression models showed significant 
association between severe IPSS scores (>18) and urinary retention requiring 
catheterization in both males and females with both high specificity and 
sensitivity in the test in predicting postoperative catheterization. Hence, this 
test is a valid preoperative screen in predicting postoperative catheterization.

[Purpose] Intensive training can at least partially improve finger movement 
dysfunction observed after stroke or any neurodegenerative disease. Wearable 
equipment can significantly improve patients' quality of life. However, 
long-term use of conventional training gloves containing metal can injure 
joints. In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of a novel, 
metal-free, wearable strength-building device. [Participants and Methods] We 
enrolled 20 healthy participants in whom we measured grip and pinch strength 
before and while the equipment was worn. Additionally, we investigated the 
adverse effects and discomfort experienced while participants wore the 
equipment. [Results] The grip strength was reduced by approximately 20% while 
participants wore the equipment. We did not observe any serious adverse events. 
[Conclusion] The knitting equipment described in this study resists movements 
associated with gripping the hand and acts on all fingers, and may be useful for 
rehabilitation to improve finger function during routine activities.

Background: Physical activity (PA) programs are inexpensive, non-pharmaceutical 
and universally accessible options with demonstrated efficacy in reducing 
menopausal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine the 
effectiveness of a behavioral strategy for initiating and sustaining PA with the 
hope to reduce or eliminate menopausal symptoms. Methods : Menopausal and 
perimenopausal women (n=190) were randomly assigned to intervention (n=95) and 
non-intervention (n=95) groups using a random-numbers table. The intervention 
group consisted of 18 neighborhood network subgroups, each consisting of five to 
six women known to one another. They participated in a 12-week regular PA 
program, augmented by eight interactive group education and discussion sessions. 
The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) self-report instrument was used to determine 
perceived severity of menopausal symptoms. Results: The intervention group 
showed a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of menopausal 
symptoms (P < 0.001). Those whose symptoms rated severe/very severe for hot 
flushes were reduced from 30.1% to 11.8%. Also, participants whose sleep 
problems and joint discomfort rated severe/very severe declined from 28% to 6.5% 
and joint discomfort rated severe or very severe was reduced from 52.7% to 4.4%, 
respectively. Conversely in the nonintervention group, hot flushes, sleep 
problems and joint problems got significantly worse(P < 0.05). Conclusion: 
Implementing educational program that increases awareness of PA benefits in 
combination with existing neighborhood networks that facilitate communication 
and cooperation may increase PA levels and decrease menopausal symptoms. Such 
networks offer alow-cost means of improving quality of life (QOL) for 
perimenopausal and menopausal women.

BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a common condition affecting the 
temporomandibular joint and causes pain and discomfort. However, the role of 
factors contributing to this problem is still controversial. The purpose of this 
cross-sectional study was to determine the correlation of occlusal factors and 
parafunctional habits with TMD and The determination of TMD prevalence among 
patients referring to Isfahan Dental School in 2017.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, A total of 200 patients 
between 20 and 50 years were examined and questioned based on the Research 
Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders assessment instrument. The 
association of occlusal factors (dental relationship, lateral occlusal scheme, 
horizontal differences between centric occlusion and Maximum intercuspation 
(MI), difference between MI and mandibular resting position) and parafunctional 
habits (bruxism/clenching and habits) with TMD was analyzed using Chi-square 
tests and independent sample t-test (α = 0.05). Binomial logistic regression 
analysis was performed with respect to confounding variables.
RESULTS: The prevalence of TMD in the studied sample was 58.9%. Only bruxism 
showed a significant difference between TMD and non-TMD groups (P < 0.05). Other 
parafunctional and occlusal factors did not act as influential factors for TMD.
CONCLUSION: Parafunction may play an important role in the initiation of TMD, 
although other habits and occlusal factors are considered as noninfluential 
factors. However, larger sample size and multicenter sampling are recommended 
for the future studies.

BACKGROUND: Medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRTs) can result in the 
development of osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis. Clinical experience suggests 
that symptoms such as dull pain or discomfort in the popliteal area or the calf 
area, which are sometimes misdiagnosed as sciatic nerve pain, may precede 
impending rupture. We found that bone marrow edema emanating from the meniscal 
root on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans-spreading roots sign-may indicate 
the preliminary stage of an MMPRT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
efficacy of the spreading roots sign as an MMPRT-predictor.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, we reviewed the chart data and MRI results of 
patients who had required surgery for an acute MMPRT. We grouped patients by 
whether or not they had reported the above-mentioned precursory symptoms prior 
to acute rupture (precursory symptom group/non-precursor group), and when 
possible, we examined MRI scans to identify with which events the 
appearance/disappearance of the spreading roots sign coincided. Sex, age, body 
mass index, bone mineral density, radiological parameters, and MRI parameters 
were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Data from 24 patients (precursory symptom group, n = 17 [70.8 %]; 
non-precursor group, n = 7 [29.2 %]) were included; data from 5 patients 
included MRI scans prior to acute rupture. There were no significant differences 
between precursory symptom and non-precursor groups, except for the ratio of the 
presence of the spreading roots sign (p = 0.005). The appearance of the 
spreading roots sign on MRI scans coincided with the onset of precursory 
symptoms, and its disappearance coincided with acute rupture and the appearance 
of other MRI signs typical of MMPRT (white meniscus/truncation/meniscal 
extrusion/giraffe neck signs).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the spreading roots sign can be used as a 
unique precursory sign for MMPRT.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of therapy ball seating as an 
alternative for typical chair seating in a classroom. We evaluated the effect of 
ball seating on the student's sitting discomfort and academic performance using 
Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire and problem-based learning 
scales, respectively. A sample of convenience was taken. Data was collected and 
analyzed using t-test. Subjects experienced a major discomfort at neck and a 
minor discomfort at knee joint. Results showed that there was a significant 
improvement (P ≤ 0.05) in sitting discomfort and student's performance when 
seated on therapy balls compared to typical classroom chairs. This study 
provides evidence for the effectiveness of therapy balls as a classroom seating 
for students who exhibit sitting discomfort and problem-based learning.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease 
associated with oxidative stress that causes excruciating pain, discomfort, and 
joint destruction. Ebselen (EB), a synthesized versatile organo-selenium 
compound, protects cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced injury by 
mimicking glutathione peroxidase (GPx) action. This study aimed to investigate 
the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of EB in an arthritic irradiated 
model. This goal was achieved by subjecting adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) 
rats to fractionated whole body γ-irradiation (2 Gy/fraction once per week for 3 
consecutive weeks, for a total dose of 6 Gy) and treating them with EB 
(20 mg/kg/day, p.o) or methotrexate (MTX; 0.05 mg/kg; twice/week, i.p) as a 
reference anti-RA drug. The arthritic clinical signs, oxidative stress and 
antioxidant biomarkers, inflammatory response, expression of NOD-like receptor 
protein-3 (NLRP-3) inflammasome, receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand 
(RANKL), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), apoptotic indicators (caspase 1 and caspase 
3), cartilage integrity marker (collagen-II), and histopathological examination 
of ankle joints were assessed. EB notably improved the severity of arthritic 
clinical signs, alleviated joint histopathological lesions, modulated oxidative 
stress and inflammation in serum and synovium, as well as reduced NLRP-3, RANKL, 
and caspase3 expression while boosting collagen-II expression in the ankle 
joints of arthritic and arthritic irradiated rats with comparable potency to 
MTX. Our findings suggest that EB, through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
properties, has anti-arthritic and radioprotective properties in an arthritic 
irradiated model.

We present the case of a 40-year-old man who suffered an isolated proximal 
tibiofibular dislocation of the left knee after a trauma during a soccer game. 
Physical examination and radiographic imaging revealed an anterolateral 
dislocation of the proximal fibula. The diagnosis was confirmed by MRI. The 
treatment choice was open reduction and internal fixation under direct 
visualisation using flexible and permanent internal fixation. Postoperative 
treatment includes knee immobilisation during the first week, and partial weight 
was allowed for 2 weeks progressing to full weight bearing over 4 weeks. The 
patient started a gradual and progressive physical therapy programme with range 
of motion exercises, muscle strengthening and gait training. Full knee range of 
motion was achieved after 4 weeks. No complaint of pain or hardware discomfort 
was reported, and the patient is back to daily life and sports activities after 
6 months of surgical treatment.

University (Ganzhou People's Hospital), Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China.

RATIONALE: Chordoma is a relatively rare tumor that accounts for 1% to 4% of all 
malignant bone tumors, with an annual incidence of <0.1 per 100,000 people. 
Although chordoma is aligned with the axis of the spine and most commonly 
develops in the sacrum, to the best of our knowledge, giant sacrococcygeal 
chordoma is extremely rare.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 61-year-old Chinese man presented with a massive dorsal 
sacral mass. The patient's primary complaint was that, during the last two 
months, the mass had been increasing in size and his right lower extremity was 
uncomfortable while he was sitting, although the discomfort was relieved when he 
was standing.
DIAGNOSES: Based on the imaging findings, we suspected that the sacrococcygeal 
mass was a chordoma, and a postoperative pathological examination confirmed the 
diagnosis of a sacral chordoma.
INTERVENTION: The patient underwent extensive open surgery to achieve complete 
resection of the sacrococcygeal mass. An occlusion balloon catheter was used in 
the abdominal aorta to minimize intraoperative bleeding and maintain a clear 
surgical field.
OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged without complications at 27 days after 
surgery. The 3-month follow-up revealed that the patient had recovered well, the 
discomfort in his right lower extremity while standing had completely resolved 
and that there was no evidence of recurrence.
LESSONS: The development of chordoma is not associated with clear symptoms, 
although early diagnosis and treatment are needed to prevent invasion of the 
nearby tissues and organs. Therefore, we believe that surgical treatment of 
sacral chordoma is effective, although care must be taken to completely remove 
all residual tumor tissue and reduce the risk of recurrence. Besides, This 
report adds to our limited understanding of the rare giant sacrococcygeal 
chordoma.

PURPOSE: We present the Aberdeen Weight-Bearing Test (Knee), an objective test 
specific for anterior knee discomfort assessed via load bearing. We assess its 
validity by performing it on normal subjects with no knee symptoms and subjects 
who had undergone anterograde tibial nailing.
METHODS: Two scales are placed parallel on the floor with the dials concealed 
from the subject. The subject then kneels with one knee on each scale. The 
weight through each knee is recorded at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s. The proportion 
of total body weight on each leg at each timepoint is calculated, and a ratio 
calculated from the values. A value of 1 equates to equal weight on each leg. 
The test was performed on 53 normal subjects and 38 subjects who had undergone 
tibial nailing.
RESULTS: In the normal group, no significant difference in mean ratio of weight 
distribution (left:right) was seen at any timepoint (mean ratio 
range = 0.98-0.99, p value range = 0.18-0.64). In the tibial nail group, a 
difference was observed in mean ratio of weight distribution (injured:uninjured) 
favouring the uninjured leg, reaching significance at 0, 15, 30, and 45 s (mean 
ratio range = 0.88-0.94, p value range = 0.01-0.02). At 60 s, the mean ratio was 
0.93 (p = 0.09).
CONCLUSION: The Aberdeen Weight-Bearing Test (Knee) is an objective, easily 
reproducible, specific test for anterior knee discomfort. It produces different 
results in individuals who have undergone anterograde tibial nailing compared to 
individuals with no knee symptoms.

In 2010-2011, a waterborne outbreak of the parasite, Cryptosporidium hominis, 
affected approximately 27,000 inhabitants in the city of Östersund, Sweden. 
Previous research suggested that post-infectious symptoms, such as 
gastrointestinal symptoms and joint pain, could persist for up to 2 years after 
the initial infection. In this study, we investigated whether the parasite 
caused post-infectious sequelae for up to 5 years after the outbreak. 
Prospective cohort study. A randomly selected cohort of individuals residing in 
Östersund at the time of the outbreak was sent a postal questionnaire in 2011. 
Responders were sent a follow-up questionnaire in 2016 and completed items on 
whether they experienced a list of symptoms. We examined whether outbreak cases 
were more likely than non-cases to report post-infectious symptoms 5 years 
later. We analysed data using logistic regression and calculated odds ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals. The analysis included 626 individuals. Among the 
262 individuals infected during the outbreak, 56.5% reported symptoms at 
follow-up. Compared to non-cases, outbreak cases were more likely to report 
watery diarrhoea, diarrhoea, swollen joints, abdominal pain, bloating, joint 
discomfort, acid indigestion, alternating bowel habits, joint pain, ocular pain, 
nausea, and fatigue at the follow-up, after adjusting for age and sex. Our 
findings suggested that cryptosporidiosis was mainly associated with 
gastrointestinal- and joint-related post-infectious symptoms for up to 5 years 
after the infection.

As the rapidly evolving Covid-19 pandemic spread and became a global concern and 
the study of the disease's features became possible, its signs and symptoms were 
elucidated in many studies around the world. In addition to other fairly typical 
symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath, the 
Covid-19 pandemic has several neurological symptoms that have been noted and 
documented, including headaches, muscle, and joint discomfort, loss of taste and 
smell, as well as generalized body aches. However, there were a few unusual 
symptoms that were noted, one of which we will focus on in this report, namely, 
tooth pain. The Covid-19 virus has caused tooth pain and discomfort in two 
Lebanese patients. The reported pain is not related to any local aggression; 
therefore, it is likely a neurological consequence of the viral infection by the 
SARS-Cov-2 virus.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of an 
antioxidant/anti-inflammatory supplement containing standardized lemon verbena 
(Aloysia triphylla, Lippia citriodora) extract and fish oil omega-3 fatty acid 
in a human pilot trial as an alternative treatment for joint management.
METHODS AND DESIGN: First, antioxidant activity of the supplement was determined 
through an oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. In a randomized, 
double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, 45 subjects with pain discomfort 
received the nutritional supplement or placebo for 9 weeks. Western Ontario 
MacMaster (WOMAC) and Lequesne's questionnaires, which are disease-specific 
measurements validated to measure joint dysfunction and pain, were administered 
and evaluated once per week in the placebo and intervention groups.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain and stiffness symptoms, and joint function were 
determined once per week through recording their respective WOMAC and Lequesne's 
scores in the placebo and intervention groups. Statistically significant 
differences were determined at every measurement point between the two groups.
RESULTS: Lemon verbena extract showed strong antioxidant properties as measured 
by the ORAC assay. The nutritional supplement containing standardized lemon 
verbena extract (14% verbascoside, w/w) and fish oil omega-3 fatty acid reduced 
symptoms of pain and stiffness significantly, and improved physical function as 
shown by WOMAC and Lequesne's scores after 9 weeks of treatment. WOMAC and 
Lequesne's total scores decreased 53% and 78%, respectively, at the end of the 
study compared to initial conditions. Onset of the effect was observed at the 
third and fourth weeks, when statistically significant differences were 
detected, compared to placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study reveals that supplementation with lemon verbena 
combined with omega-3 fatty acids may be considered for further investigation as 
a complementary and alternative treatment for improving joint status in subjects 
with joint discomfort.

Uvular necrosis is a rare post-procedural complication thought to be caused by 
mechanical compression of the uvula during endotracheal intubation. We described 
the day-to-day progression of uvular necrosis after right shoulder 
acromioclavicular (AC) joint reconstruction. We present a case of a 22-year-old 
male who visited the emergency department after sustaining a right shoulder 
trauma. Diagnosis of a type V AC dislocation with total coracoclavicular 
ligament tear was established. On day one, after endotracheal intubation for the 
right shoulder AC joint reconstruction, the patient complained of severe throat 
pain that progressed to odynophagia, dysphagia, and choking. Examination 
revealed an erythematous uvula with well-demarcated necrotic tissue. He was 
managed conservatively with acetaminophen and ice chips. Day-to-day symptom 
progression description may guide physicians in managing postoperative uvular 
necrosis.

Examination and intervention for sinus tarsi syndrome.

Helgeson K(1).

Author information:
(1)Idaho State University, Pocatello, Idaho.

Athletes with persistent anterolateral ankle discomfort may have developed sinus 
tarsi syndrome (STS). Sinus tarsi syndrome develops from excessive motions of 
the subtalar joint that results in subtalar joint synovitis and infiltration of 
fibrotic tissue into the sinus tarsi space. Physical therapists treating 
athletes with ankle conditions should examine the talocrural and subtalar joints 
for signs of hypermobility as injuries can affect both of these important 
articulations of the lower extremity. Localized ankle discomfort to the sinus 
tarsi space and feelings of instability with pronation and supination movements 
of the subtalar joint will help identify STS. Intervention for this condition 
will focus on enhancing subtalar joint stability and function of the lower 
extremities. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to discuss the 
etiologies and signs of STS and describe the components of an intervention plan 
appropriate for athletes with STS.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Nontyphoidal Salmonella infection can lead to 
gastroenteritis, enteric fever, and bacteremia. However, joint infections due to 
this bacterium are rare, and usually associated with immunosuppressive 
disorders.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old girl, with a recent history of acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) presented with bacteremia, and bilateral hip pain 
after COVID-19 symptoms. Clinical presentation, laboratory features and imaging 
showed bilateral nontyphoidal Salmonella septic arthritis. We administered 
antibiotics, based on antibiotics susceptibility pattern of the isolated 
Salmonella.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The case is presented because reports of bilateral hip 
joint infection due to nontyphoidal Salmonella are rare especially after 
COVID-19. When the patient presents with joint discomfort, the clinician should 
think infection especially in immunocompromised hosts.
CONCLUSION: It illustrates successful management of septic arthritis requires 
prompt clinical diagnosis, microorganism identification, administration of 
appropriate systemic antibiotics and hip joint surgery.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic lumbosacral instability is a rare but potentially 
devastating injury. These injuries are frequently associated with neurologic 
injury and often result in long-term disability. Despite their severity, 
radiographic findings can be subtle, and multiple reports exist in which these 
injuries were not recognized on initial imaging. Transverse process fractures, 
high-energy mechanisms, and other injury features have been suggested as 
indications for advanced imaging, which has a high degree of sensitivity in 
detecting unstable injuries.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old man presented to our level I trauma center 
after being ejected in a rollover motor vehicle collision. He sustained multiple 
injuries, including multiple lumbar transverse process fractures and a 
unilateral superior articular facet fracture of S1.
PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Initial supine computed tomography (CT) images showed no 
displacement of the fracture and no listhesis or instability. Subsequent upright 
imaging in a brace, however, demonstrated significant displacement of the 
fracture with dislocation of the contralateral L5-S1 facet joint and significant 
anterolisthesis. The patient underwent open posterior reduction and 
stabilization of L4-S1 followed by L5-S1 anterior lumbar interbody fusion. The 
patient demonstrated excellent alignment on postoperative imaging. At 3 months 
postoperatively, he had returned to work, was ambulating without assistance, and 
reported minimal back discomfort and no lower extremity pain, numbness, or 
weakness.
CONCLUSION: This case serves as a warning that supine CT imaging alone may not 
be sufficient to rule out unstable lumbar spine injuries, such as traumatic 
L5-S1 instability, and that upright radiographs in these potentially unstable 
injuries may represent a hazard to patients. Fractures involving the pedicle, 
pars, or facet joints as well as multiple transverse process fractures and/or a 
high-energy mechanism of injury should all raise suspicion of instability and 
warrant additional imaging.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This article provides guidance on approaching treatment for 
patients with potential traumatic lumbosacral instability.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged sitting at work can lead to adverse health outcomes. The 
health risk of office workers is an increasing concern for the society and 
industry, with prolonged sitting work becoming more prevalent.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the variation in muscle activities during 
prolonged sitting work and found out when and how to take a break to mitigate 
the risk of muscle symptoms.
METHODS: A preliminary survey was conducted to find out the prevalence of muscle 
discomfort in sedentary work. Firstly, a 2-h sedentary computer work was 
designed based on the preliminary study to investigate the variation in muscle 
activities. Twenty-four participants took part in the electromyography (EMG) 
measurement study. The EMG variations in the trapezius muscle and latissimus 
dorsi were investigated. Then the intervention time was determined based on the 
EMG measurement study. Secondly, 48 participants were divided into six groups to 
compare the effectiveness of every break type (passive break, active break of 
changing their posture, and stand and stretch their body with 5 or 10 mins). 
Finally, data consisting of EMG amplitudes and spectra and subjective assessment 
of discomfort were analyzed.
RESULTS: In the EMG experiment, results from the joint analysis of the spectral 
and amplitude method showed muscle fatigue after about 40 mins of sedentary 
work. In the intervention experiment, the results showed that standing and 
stretching for 5 mins was the most effective break type, and this type of break 
could keep the muscles' state at a recovery level for about 30-45 mins.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers the possibility of being applied to office 
workers and provides preliminary data support and theoretical exploration for a 
follow-up early muscle fatigue detection system.

Recurrence of Primary Synovial Chondromatosis (Reichel's Syndrome) in the Ankle 
Joint following Surgical Excision.

Primary synovial chondromatosis, or Reichel's syndrome, is a rare benign tumour 
arising from the synovial lining of a joint. We present the case of a 
25-year-old male with Reichel's syndrome of the ankle, with subsequent 
recurrence following open retrieval of loose bodies. The initial presentation 
was of lateral malleolus discomfort which limited moderately strenuous exercise. 
Clinical examination showed a mild effusion and pain on extremes of movement. 
Imaging confirmed the presence of multiple loose bodies within the anterior and 
anterolateral recesses of the ankle. Open removal of 27 loose bodies from the 
joint was performed, with good postoperative recovery. He represented with pain 
9 months later, with imaging of the ankle showing reaccumulation of loose bodies 
to a lesser extent. A trial of conservative management was opted for. Reichel's 
syndrome confined to the ankle is an exceedingly rare diagnosis, with few cases 
reported in the literature. This case saw the recurrence of the disease in a 
short time period despite successful surgery in the first instance. Management 
options to treat recurrence include repeat retrieval of foreign bodies, 
synovectomy, radiotherapy, or arthrodesis. While the prognosis is favourable, a 
low risk of malignant potential warrants adequate patient follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Acromioclavicular joint dislocation is a shoulder joint injury 
common in the clinical setting and is generally surgically treated with 
clavicular hook plate technique with confirmed curative effect. However, 
symptoms such as shoulder abduction limitation, shoulder discomfort and joint 
pain postoperatively may occur in some patients. Therefore, this study aimed to 
explore whether the existing clavicular hook plate can be reasonably selected to 
reduce the incidence of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) and provide a 
reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with SIS admitted from March 2018 to June 2020 
were selected as the experimental group and asymptomatic patients 
postoperatively, as the control group. The hook end depth and acromial height of 
the hook plate used in patients were recorded, and the difference between them 
was calculated.
RESULTS: The difference between the hook plate depth and acromial height was 
7.500±1.912 mm and 6.563±1.537 mm in the experimental and control groups, 
respectively, with statistically significant difference (t=3.021, P=0.006). A 
difference of >0.6 mm as a grouping index is required to perform a single factor 
analysis, with statistically significant difference (t=3.908, P=0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of SIS after placing the clavicular hook plate may 
be related to the difference between its depth and the acromial height. A 
difference of >6 mm may be a factor affecting the occurrence of SIS. Pre-imaging 
measurement of the acromial height can provide suggestions for selecting the 
type of hook plate intraoperatively.

OBJECTIVE: The benefit of the use of some intraoral devices in arthrogenous 
temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients is still unknown. This study assessed 
the effectiveness of the partial use of intraoral devices and counseling in the 
management of patients with disc displacement with reduction (DDWR) and 
arthralgia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 DDWR and arthralgia patients were randomly 
divided into three groups: group I (n=20) wore anterior repositioning occlusal 
splints (ARS); group II (n=20) wore the Nociceptive Trigeminal Inhibition 
Clenching Suppression System devices (NTI-tss); and group III (n=20) only 
received counseling for behavioral changes and self-care (the control group). 
The first two groups also received counseling. Follow-ups were performed after 2 
weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months. In these sessions, patients were evaluated by means 
of a visual analogue scale, pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ), maximum range of motion and TMJ sounds. Possible 
adverse effects were also recorded, such as discomfort while using the device 
and occlusal changes. The results were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey's and Fisher 
Exact Test, with a significance level of 5%.
RESULTS: Groups I and II showed improvement in pain intensity at the first 
follow-up. This progress was recorded only after 3 months in Group III. Group II 
showed an increased in joint sounds frequency. The PPT values, mandibular range 
of motion and the number of occlusal contacts did not change significantly.
CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of intraoral devices (partial time) plus 
behavioral modifications seems to produce a more rapid pain improvement in 
patients with painful DDWR. The use of NTI-tss could increase TMJ sounds. 
Although intraoral devices with additional counseling should be considered for 
the management of painful DDWR, dentists should be aware of the possible side 
effects of the intraoral device's design.

BACKGROUND: For manual wheelchair users, overuse of the upper limbs can cause 
upper limb musculoskeletal disorders, which can lead to a loss of autonomy. The 
main objective of this study was to quantify the risk level of musculoskeletal 
disorders of different slope propulsions in manual wheelchair users using fuzzy 
logic.
METHODS: In total, 17 spinal cord injury participants were recruited. Each 
participant completed six passages on a motorized treadmill, the inclination of 
which varied between (0° to 4.8°). A motion capture system associated with 
instrumented wheels of a wheelchair was used. Using a biomechanical model of the 
upper limb and the fuzzy logic method, an Articular Discomfort Index (ADI) was 
developed.
RESULTS: We observed an increase in articular discomfort during propulsion on a 
slope with increasing discomfort at the shoulder, elbow and wrist, due to an 
increase in kinetics. There was a kinetically significant change in the kinetic 
global ADI (22 to 25%) and no change in the kinematic. The ADI increased from 14 
to 36% during slope propulsion for each joint.
CONCLUSION: The quantification of the level of discomfort helps us to highlight 
the situations with the most high-risk exposures and to identify the parameters 
responsible for this discomfort.

Disorders of temporomandibular joint (TMDs) are characterised by a variety of 
symptoms, including discomfort in the orofacial region, muscle tenderness, 
restricted jaw motion and noise at the joint. Additional neurological symptoms 
such as headaches, vertigo, heaviness, and altered vision may also coexist with 
TMDs. Because prostaglandin production is a critical mediator of inflammatory 
reaction and is inhibited by corticosteroids, they have anti-inflammatory 
effects. Platelet rich plasma popularly considered as PRP is a concentration of 
platelets and related growth factors that may have therapeutic effects by 
attracting, promoting, and differentiating cells as well as redesigning tissue. 
64 joints totaling 40 individuals with temporomandibular joint problems were 
split into two categories (Category A and Category B). PRP was applied to 
category A's (36 joints of 20 patients) joints, while Group B's joints received 
hydrocortisone combined with local anaesthetic (28 joints of 20 patients). 
Patients were evaluated for tenderness, , maximum inter incisal opening (MIO) 
and clicking sound at TMJ prior to and following treatment at intervals of one 
week, one month and 6 months of the first week and third month. When there was 
comparison of outcomes in study participants receiving injections of platelet 
rich plasma and study participants receiving injections of hydrocortisone with 
local anesthetic then it was found that although both type of study participants 
got reduction in pain, increased opening of mouth and reduction in clicking 
sound however the difference between two groups was not significant 
statistically. There was no statistically significant difference between 
injections of platelet rich plasma and hydrocortisone with local anesthetic 
solution regarding outcomes in disorders of temporomandibular joint, however the 
results were slightly better in study participants receiving platelet rich 
plasma injections. This study demonstrated that while treating patients with TMJ 
issues, local anaesthesia combined with hydrocortisone as well as 
intra-articular injection of PRP help in reduction in pain, increase mouth 
opening, and minimize joint sound. Additionally, it was discovered that 
intra-articular injection of PRP was more successful in treating patients in 
this trial than local anaesthetic combined with hydrocortisone.

Sodium hyaluronate (SH) is a high molecular-weight polysaccharide composed of 
repeating polymeric disaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and 
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. SH is present in every connective tissue and organ, with 
synovial fluid having the highest concentration of SH in the body. The 
effectiveness of oral SH on gonarthrosis is known; although, its influence on 
the knees of healthy individuals is not. However, as severe diseases may require 
surgery, it is better to take care of healthy knees before the onset of 
gonarthrosis. Therefore, the present study investigated the functionality of SH 
on the knee of healthy individuals. The present study was a randomized 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which healthy adults (mean age: 
Placebo group, 61.50±1.59; SH group, 58.50±1.81), rated as grade ≤1 based on the 
Kellgren-Lawrence classification, were administered 111 mg/day SH for 12 weeks. 
The evaluation of visual analog scales were performed to assess the discomfort 
in the knees of the participants and were conducted at baseline, and then 6 and 
12 weeks after the start of SH ingestion. Additionally, a locomotive syndrome 
risk test quantifying the mobility of the participants, a one-leg standing time 
with eyes open test evaluating the strength of the leg muscle as well as the 
ability to balance by measuring the time to stand on one leg and a blood test 
(interleukin-10, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, γ-glutamyl 
transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and C-reactive protein) were 
performed at baseline and then 12 weeks after the start of SH ingestion. A 
significant suppression of knee symptoms were demonstrated in the SH group 
compared with the placebo group in terms of the total visual analog scale scores 
for pain, stiffness and discomfort for the 31 healthy adult subjects. 
Significant suppression of symptoms was also demonstrated in the placebo group 
in terms of discomfort in the knees when descending stairs and pain in the knees 
after walking for a longer distance or duration than normal. No significant 
differences between the two groups were demonstrated in the locomotive syndrome 
risk test, one-leg standing time with eyes open test and the blood test. The 
results of the present study suggest the possibility that oral SH may help to 
maintain a healthy condition of the knees. The study protocol was registered 
with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry 
in advance (registration no. UMIN000045980, November 4, 2021).

Few standards and guidelines to prevent health problems have been associated 
with tablet use. We estimated the effects of posture and tablet tilt angle on 
muscle activity and posture in healthy young adults. Seventeen healthy young 
adults (age: 20.5 ± 3 years) performed a cognitive task using a tablet in two 
posture (sitting and standing) and tablet tilt angle (0 degrees and 45 deg) 
conditions. Segment and joint kinematics were evaluated using 16 inertial 
measurement unit sensors. Neck, trunk, and upper limb electromyography (EMG) 
activities were monitored using 12 EMG sensors. Perceived discomfort, 
kinematics, and EMG activities were compared between conditions using the 
Friedman test. The perceived discomfort in the standing-0 deg condition was 
significantly higher than in the remaining three conditions. Standing posture 
and tablet inclination significantly reduced the sagittal segment and joint 
angles of the spine, compared with sitting and flat tablet conditions. 
Similarly, standing posture and tablet inclination significantly reduced EMG 
activities of the dorsal neck, upper, and lower trunk muscles, while increasing 
EMG activity of shoulder flexors. Standing posture and tablet inclination 
reduced the sagittal flexion angle, and dorsal neck, upper, and lower trunk 
muscle activities, while potentially increasing the muscle activity of arm 
flexors.

Osteoarthrosis is the most common form of knee arthritis, characterized by pain 
and discomfort from primarily articular cartilage wear. Traditionally in its end 
stage, it has been treated with total knee arthroplasty, a permanent process 
with a life span of ten to fifteen years and challenges with revision. With an 
increasing longevity and epidemic of obesity that the population is facing, 
naturally, we are seeing more and more patients with osteoarthrosis at a younger 
age. This makes it imperative to extend the life of the native knee by 
conservative measures, injections of steroid, hyaluronic acid, or biologicals 
and finally a slew of surgical alternatives ranging from joint realignment to 
partial and total joint replacement. Besides the clinical presentation, 
decisions are made based on joint alignment, extent and degree of cartilage wear 
and the status of the subchondral bone. Imaging plays an invaluable role in 
surgical decision making. In this article, we will discuss how imaging is used 
in our practice during decision making for the management of the young 
osteoarthritic knee.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effectiveness of atlantoaxial joint release through 
anterior retrophayngeal approach and staged posterior reduction fixation and 
fusion for irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (IAAD).
METHODS: Fifteen patients with IAAD (9 males, 6 females), aged 14-53 years 
(mean, 31.4 years) were included in the study. The disease duration was 3 months 
to 17 years (mean, 5.7 years). IAAD was attributed to trauma in 13 cases, and 2 
cases were caused by congenital odontoid disconnection. Preoperative imaging 
examination showed atlantoaxial dislocation and could not be reset automatically 
in functional position. The preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 
3-7 (mean, 4.1), and the preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) 
score was 10-17 (mean, 13.8). All patients received atlantoaxial joint release 
through anterior retrophayngeal approach and staged posterior fixation and 
fusion.
RESULTS: Anatomical reduction was achieved in all 15 patients, and the alignment 
of atlantoaxial joints was restored. After operation, the neck pain and 
neurological symptom were partially or fully improved in all patients, without 
deterioration of neurological function. One patient developed pharyngeal 
discomfort and cough after one-stage operation, 4 patients developed pharyngeal 
discomfort and foreign body sensation after operation, and 2 patients developed 
pin-path lipstick swelling during skull traction. All patients were cured by 
symptomatic treatment. No pulmonary infection, pressure ulcers, venous 
thrombosis, and incision infection was found during the treatment. All 15 
patients were followed up 24-36 months, with an average of 28.6 months. Bony 
fusion was achieved in all patients, and the fusion time was 3-5 months, with an 
average of 3.6 months. At last follow-up, the VAS score was 0-2 (mean, 0.5) and 
the JOA score was 13-17 (mean, 15.9). There was no dislocation, recurrence, or 
other abnormal sign in the cervical X-ray films and three-dimensional CT.
CONCLUSION: Anatomical reduction can be achieved by atlantoaxial joint release 
through anterior retrophayngeal approach and staged posterior fixation and 
fusion for treating IAAD. It is an optional procedure for IAAD.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of tibolone and transdermal 
estrogen in treating menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with an intact 
uterus.
METHODS: Overall, 26 women consumed tibolone orally and 31 women received 
transdermal estrogen gel mixed with progestogen. The menopause rating scale 
(MRS) was used to assess their menopausal symptoms at their first outpatient 
visit and 6 months later.
RESULTS: The transdermal estrogen group showed significant improvements in more 
items of the MRS questionnaire. There was a favorable change in body weight in 
the transdermal estrogen group compared with that in the tibolone group. 
Depressive mood, irritability, physical and mental exhaustion, sexual and 
bladder problems, and joint and muscular discomfort improved only in the 
transdermal estrogen group, whereas heart discomfort and vaginal dryness 
improved only in the tibolone group. Nevertheless, the intergroup differences in 
each item were insignificant after adjusting for body mass index and 
hypertension, which differed before treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the therapeutic options improved menopausal symptoms within 6 
months of use. However, transdermal estrogen appeared to be more effective in 
preventing weight gain in menopausal women than tibolone.

A new methodology for objective evaluation of discomfort in whole-body vibration 
(WBV) is introduced in this work. The proposed objective discomfort 
characterizes discomfort based on the relative motion between adjacent segments 
of the human body from neutral positions. It peaks when the joints reach their 
limits. The objective discomfort has been tested on five subjects in the 
fore-aft direction using discrete sinusoidal frequencies of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 
3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16 Hz. Each frequency file 
runs for 15 s with a 3 s resting period as a reference for discomfort 
comparison. All files run at a constant acceleration of 0.7 m/s(2). The subjects 
were tested with back support and without back support, and their subjective 
discomfort was reported based on the Borg CR-10 scale. The proposed objective 
discomfort has shown significant correlation with the subjective discomfort. The 
objective discomfort has also been tested on five subjects under multiple-axis 
random WBV with three common industrial seating configurations (seat-mounted 
control, floor-mounted control, and steering wheel), and has shown promising 
results.

Debridement versus re-attachment of acetabular labral tears: A review of the 
literature and quantitative analysis.

We have reviewed the current literature to compare the results of surgery aimed 
to repair or debride a damaged acetabular labrum. We identified 28 studies to be 
included in the review containing a total of 1631 hips in 1609 patients. Of 
these studies 12 reported a mean rate of good results of 82% (from 67% to 100%) 
for labral debridement. Of the 16 studies that reported a combination of 
debridement and re-attachment, five reported a comparative outcome for the two 
methods, four reported better results with re-attachment and one study did not 
find any significant difference in outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of the 
studies it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis or draw accurate 
conclusions. Confounding factors in the studies include selection bias, use of 
historical controls and high rates of loss of follow-up. It seems logical to 
repair an unstable tear in a good quality labrum with good potential to heal in 
order potentially to preserve its physiological function. A degenerative labrum 
on the other hand may be the source of discomfort and its preservation may 
result in persistent pain and the added risk of failure of re-attachment. The 
results of the present study do not support routine refixation for all labral 
tears.

Hyper immunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease 
often presents during infancy. The disease is caused by an abnormal gene that 
codes for mevalonate kinase (MVK). This results in recurrent fever episodes and 
gastrointestinal discomfort (including diarrhea, joint pain, and oral sores). 
High fever is the most common symptom, occurring every few weeks to months. 
Patients may also have other findings, including lymphadenopathy and arthralgia. 
In this report, we discuss a rare diagnosis of HIDS is an adult and discuss our 
case in the context of existing literature. Given the nonspecific symptoms and 
the fact that it is often diagnosed in childhood, HIDS can be a challenging but 
essential diagnosis in adults with persistent, cyclical fevers.

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is an extremely rare endocrinal 
disorder with a prevalence of 37 per 100,000. Herein we presented a case of a 
30-year-old male who came with symptoms of muscle weakness, carpopedal spasms 
and limitation of movement which gradually progressed over 8 years.
CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old male patient presented in an outpatient department of 
a tertiary care centre with a complaint of severe pain in both hip joints. He 
had generalized muscle weakness, facial discomfort, recurrent episodes of 
carpopedal spasms and crampy abdominal pains. On clinical examination, the 
patient had Chvostek sign and Trousseau sign. Biochemical tests revealed 
hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypomagnesemia with low plasma parathyroid 
hormone level. X-ray of the pelvis and spine revealed spondylarthropathic 
changes of long-standing hypoparathyroidism. Computed Tomography of the brain 
revealed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. The patient was treated with 
intravenous calcium gluconate, magnesium and oral vitamin D3. On follow-up the 
patient showed improvement of muscle weakness and carpopedal spasm with 
near-normal biochemical parameters. However, there was no improvement in 
symptoms related to spondyloarthropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder with 
clinic and biochemical features of hypocalcemia. Long- standing 
hypoparathyroidism can cause spondyloarthropathic changes closely resembling 
ankylosing spondylitis and DISH. Skeletal changes of long-standing 
hypoparathyroidism are irreversible. If left untreated, life-threatening 
complications like cardiac arrhythmias and broncholaryngospasm may occur.

Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (PLS) is a rare disorder characterized by palmar 
plantar hyperkeratosis and rapidly progressive periodontitis with loss of 
deciduous and permanent dentition at an early age. It is reported to occur in 1 
to 4 individuals per million people. This case report presents highlighting 
features of the rare PLS in a 17-year old male who complained of discomfort 
while mastication and it was accompanied with symmetrical, sharply demarcated 
erythematous plaques involving the skin of the palms and soles, which extended 
to the finger joints, elbows, and knees. Along with the rough and dry skin, 
hyperhidrosis of lesion with a foul odor and transverse grooving of nails were 
noted. The past dental history revealed normal eruption of deciduous teeth 
followed by pre-mature mobility and shedding in 4-6 months. Permanent teeth also 
showed normal eruption and early shedding in the next 4-5 years. Complete 
edentulous maxillary and mandibular arches led to a decrease in alveolar bone 
and facial heights. There was no similar disorder in the patient's family but 
family history revealed the consanguineous marriage of the patient's parents.

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the oral 
administration of Ajuga decumbens extract (ADE) supplement to individuals with 
knee discomfort associated with physical activity. A randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study was conducted using 48 subjects. The subjects were 
randomly allocated to an ADE diet group (oral administration of ADE-containing 
diet, n=24) or a placebo group (n=24), and the intervention was conducted for 12 
weeks. A total of 22 subjects in the placebo group and 22 subjects in the ADE 
diet group were assessed to be eligible for assessment of the efficacy of 
supplement. Knee function was assessed by changes in the scores of the Japanese 
Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) questionnaire and the scores of the Japan 
Orthopedic Association (JOA) criteria, as well as by analyzing the levels of 
type II collagen synthesis and degradation biomarkers (procollagen II C-terminal 
propeptide, cross-linked C-telopeptide of type II collagen, collagen type II 
cleavage and matrix metalloproteinase-13). Outcomes were measured at the 
baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks from the start of administration. Subscale II 
(joint flexion/stiffness) of the JOA criteria was markedly improved in the ADE 
diet group compared with the placebo group at 8 and 12 weeks during the 
intervention. Furthermore, in the subgroup analyses using subjects with mild 
knee discomfort, subscale II (pain/stiffness) and IV (general activities) scores 
of JKOM were significantly improved (P<0.05) and total JKOM score was markedly 
improved in the ADE diet group compared with the placebo group at week 8 of the 
intervention. No adverse effects were identified for the administration of ADE. 
In conclusion, these observations suggest that the administration of an 
ADE-containing diet is safe and improves joint function (flexion and stiffness) 
and general activity in subjects with mild knee discomfort. Therefore, ADE could 
be a promising candidate as a functional food that is beneficial to joint 
health.

BACKGROUND: Condylar osteophytes, a remodeling form of temporomandibular joint 
osteoarthritis (TMJ OA), mainly manifest as marginal angular outgrowths of the 
condyle. Previous researchers have advocated surgical removal of condylar 
osteophytes. Reports on the effect of occlusal splint on TMJ OA patients' joints 
have mostly focused on treatment with this splint, which can reduce the 
absorption of the affected condyle and promote repair and regeneration. However, 
the effect of the splint on the dissolution of condylar osteophytes has not yet 
been reported.
CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old female patient suffered from occlusal discomfort 
with left facial pain for 2 years. Cone beam computed tomography showed a rare 
osteophyte on top of her left condyle. She was finally diagnosed with TMJ OA. 
The patient refused surgical treatment and received conservative treatment with 
a muscle balance occlusal splint. The pain experienced by the patient on the 
left side of her face was relieved, and her chewing ability recovered after 
treatment. The osteophyte dissolved, and the condylar cortex remained stable 
during long-term follow-up observations.
CONCLUSION: The muscle balance occlusal splint could be a noninvasive means of 
treating condylar osteophytes in TMJ OA patients.

INTRODUCTION: First metatarsophalangeal (MTP1) joint arthrodesis, described as a 
safe and effective procedure, has complications that may require surgical 
revision. These complications are rarely studied. The aim of this study was to 
determine the incidence and outcomes of revision surgery after MT1 arthrodesis.
HYPOTHESIS: The incidence of surgical revision after MTP1 arthrodesis is not 
insignificant; however, the outcomes are satisfactory.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study between January 
2014 and December 2015, 190 forefoot revisions in patients who had previously 
undergone MTP1 arthrodesis were included by 8 surgeons. There were no exclusion 
criteria and all patients had at least 1 year of follow-up. Over the same 
period, 958 primary MTP1 arthrodesis procedures were performed.
RESULTS: The mean time to revision was 4.6±10.9 years. At a mean follow-up of 
20.5±7.4 months, 158 cases were available for analysis in 135 women and 20 men 
who had a mean age of 67.1±10.5 years. These revision procedures were carried 
out because of discomfort related to the hardware at the arthrodesis site (n=86, 
54%), nonunion (n=22, 14%), malunion (n=13, 8%) metatarsalgia or claw toe (n=18, 
11%) and first interphalangeal (IP1) joint disorders (n=13, 8%). The mean 
postoperative scores were 75±13.9 for the AOFAS and 65±19.6 for the SF36 total. 
In the nonunion cases, removal of the hardware led to better outcomes than 
repeating the arthrodesis procedure. Osteotomy in the malunion cases healed 
successfully. In the cases of IP1 osteoarthritis, secondary arthrodesis or 
arthroplasty led to good outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Relative to published results of primary MTP1 arthrodesis, the 
outcomes in our series of revision MTP1 arthrodesis surgery cases are 
practically equivalent, thus considered acceptable.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, Retrospective study.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a pathology that is characterized by progressive erosion 
of articular cartilage. In this context, medicinal plants have become relevant 
tools regarding their potential role in the prevention and treatment of OA, 
being safe and effective. The aim of this work was investigate the therapeutic 
efficacy of the ethyl acetate fraction of Bixa orellana leaves (BoEA) and 
ellagic acid (ElAc) for the therapeutic treatment of OA induced by monosodium 
iodoacetate (MIA) in rats. The plant material was extracted via maceration with 
70 % hydroalcoholic solvent (BoHE). The ethyl acetate (BoEA) fraction was by 
solvents in increasing order of polarity. The ElAc was identified and isolated 
in BoEA using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) and analytical 
curve. The OA was induced using MIA in the right knee at the knee joint. Doses 
of BoEA and ElAc were administered daily (every 24 h, orally) at concentrations 
of 50, 100 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, for 28 days after induced OA. We 
evaluated the animals through clinical and radiological examinations every 7 
days and, on the 29th day, the animals were euthanized, the joints being removed 
for histopathological analysis and the serum for cytokine analysis. BoEA and 
ElAc compounds reduced inflammation and nociception in OA and were as effective 
as indomethacin in clinical parameters of joint discomfort and allodynia in 
rats, in addition to showing improvements in radiological and histopathological 
images, acting on the progress of cartilage deterioration, proving properties 
related to anti-inflammatory and analgesic processes, being important allies for 
new therapeutic interventions for the treatment of OA.

BACKGROUND: The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of 
different operating table heights on the quality of laryngeal view and the 
discomfort of the anaesthetist during enodotracheal intubation.
METHODS: Eight anaesthetists participated, to each of whom 20 patients were 
allocated. Before induction of anaesthesia, the height of the operating table 
was adjusted to place the patient's forehead at one of four landmarks on the 
anaesthetist's body (the order being determined by block randomization with 
eight blocks): umbilicus (Group U), lowest rib margin (Group R), xiphoid process 
(Group X), and nipple (Group N). Next, the anaesthetist began the laryngoscopy 
and evaluated the grade of laryngeal view. For this 'initial posture', the 
anaesthetist was not allowed to adjust his or her posture (flexion or extension 
of the neck, lower back, knee, and ankle). This laryngeal view was then 
re-graded after these constraints were relaxed. At each posture, the 
anaesthetist's joint movements and discomfort during mask ventilation or 
intubation were evaluated.
RESULTS: The laryngeal view before postural changes was better in Group N than 
in Group U (P=0.003). The objective and subjective measurements of neck or lower 
back flexion during intubation were higher in Group U than in Groups X and N 
(P<0.01 for each). The improvement of laryngeal view resulting from postural 
changes correlated with the anaesthetist's discomfort score before the postural 
change (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher operating tables (at the xiphoid process and nipple level of 
the anaesthetist) can provide better laryngeal views with less discomfort during 
tracheal intubation. TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: NCT01649973 (clinicaltrials.gov).

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is characterized by 
inflammation of joints and cartilage degradation leading to disability, 
discomfort, severe pain, inflammation, and stiffness of the joint. It has been 
shown that adenosine, a purine nucleoside composed of adenine attached to 
ribofuranose, is enzymatically produced by the human synovium. However, the 
functional significance of adenosine signaling in homeostasis and pathology of 
synovial joints remains unclear. Adenosine acts through four cell surface 
receptors, i.e., A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, and here, we have systematically analyzed 
mice with a deficiency for A3 receptor as well as pharmacological modulations of 
this receptor with specific analogs. The data show that adenosine receptor 
signaling plays an essential role in downregulating catabolic mechanisms 
resulting in prevention of cartilage degeneration. Ablation of A3 resulted in 
development of OA in aged mice. Mechanistically, A3 signaling inhibited cellular 
catabolic processes in chondrocytes including downregulation of 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), an enzyme that promotes 
matrix degradation and inflammation, as well as Runt-related transcription 
factor 2 (RUNX2). Additionally, selective A3 agonists protected chondrocytes 
from cell apoptosis caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines or hypo-osmotic stress. 
These novel data illuminate the protective role of A3, which is mediated via 
inhibition of intracellular CaMKII kinase and RUNX2 transcription factor, the 
two major pro-catabolic regulators in articular cartilage.
KEY MESSAGES: Adenosine receptor A3 (A3) knockout results in progressive loss of 
articular cartilage in vivo. Ablation of A3 results in activation of matrix 
degradation and cartilage hypertrophy. A3 agonists downregulate RUNX2 and CaMKII 
expression in osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes. A3 prevents articular 
cartilage matrix degradation induced by inflammation and osmotic fluctuations. 
A3 agonist inhibits proteolytic activity of cartilage-degrading enzymes.

Tablet Keyboard Configuration Affects Performance, Discomfort and Task 
Difficulty for Thumb Typing in a Two-Handed Grip.

When holding a tablet computer with two hands, the touch keyboard configuration 
imposes postural constraints on the user because of the need to simultaneously 
hold the device and type with the thumbs. Designers have provided users with 
several possible keyboard configurations (device orientation, keyboard layout 
and location). However, potential differences in performance, usability and 
postures among these configurations have not been explored. We hypothesize that 
(1) the narrower standard keyboard layout in the portrait orientation leads to 
lower self-reported discomfort and less reach than the landscape orientation; 
(2) a split keyboard layout results in better overall outcomes compared to the 
standard layout; and (3) the conventional bottom keyboard location leads to the 
best outcomes overall compared to other locations. A repeated measures 
laboratory experiment of 12 tablet owners measured typing speed, discomfort, 
task difficulty, and thumb/wrist joint postures using an active marker system 
during typing tasks for different combinations of device orientation (portrait 
and landscape), keyboard layout (standard and split), and keyboard location 
(bottom, middle, top). The narrower standard keyboard with the device in the 
portrait orientation was associated with less discomfort (least squares mean 
(and S.E.) 2.9±0.6) than the landscape orientation (4.5±0.7). Additionally, the 
split keyboard decreased the amount of reaching required by the thumb in the 
landscape orientation as defined by a reduced range of motion and less MCP 
extension, which may have led to reduced discomfort (2.7±0.6) compared to the 
standard layout (4.5±0.7). However, typing speed was greater for the standard 
layout (127±5 char./min.) compared to the split layout (113±4 char./min.) 
regardless of device orientation and keyboard location. Usage guidelines and 
designers can incorporate these findings to optimize keyboard design parameters 
and form factors that promote user performance and usability for thumb 
interaction.

PURPOSE: Scapholunate dissociation is a common and significant injury to the 
wrist. Radiographs are important in the diagnosis of this injury and in the 
planning of treatment. The tangential radiograph view was described almost 
40 years ago as a method for accurately measuring scapholunate gaps. The hand is 
positioned on a 20° foam rubber block and the thumb on the cassette, which 
positions the scaphoid and lunate articular surfaces parallel, without patient 
discomfort or effort. The goal of this study was to review this method with more 
recent data and in a larger group of patients.
METHODS: Radiographs of 31 patients who had scapholunate interosseous ligament 
tears and surgical repair over a 9 year period were retrospectively evaluated. 
Each of the four authors independently measured scapholunate gaps for 
posteroanterior and tangential views.
RESULTS: The tangential view gaps were significantly greater than the 
posteroanterior gaps overall. Similar results were found for borderline cases 
where the posteroanterior gap was less than 3 mm. Every tangential view gap 
measurement was greater than its respective posteroanterior gap with good 
inter-rater reliability.
CONCLUSION: The tangential view is a reliable radiographic method to identify 
scapholunate gaps. It should be obtained when there is clinical concern for 
scapholunate dissociation, especially in patients with borderline 
posteroanterior gaps.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of 
high-intensity static stretching on flexibility and strength in the hamstrings.
METHODS: Fourteen healthy males (20.8 ± 0.6 years, 170.7 ± 6.5 cm, 66.4 ± 9.9 
kg) underwent high-intensity static stretching for three different durations 
(10, 15, and 20 seconds). The intensity of static stretching was set at the 
maximum point of discomfort. To examine the change in flexibility and strength, 
range of motion, peak passive torque, relative passive torque, muscle-tendon 
unit stiffness, peak torque of isokinetic knee flexion, and knee angle at peak 
torque of isokinetic knee flexion were measured. To evaluate a time course of 
pain, a numerical rating scale was described.
RESULTS: Range of motion (P < 0.01), peak passive torque (P < 0.01), and knee 
angle at peak torque were increased at all interventions. Relative passive 
torque (P < 0.01) and muscle-tendon unit stiffness (P < 0.01) were decreased at 
all interventions. Peak torque decreased after 10 seconds of stretching (P < 
0.05). Numerical rating scale during stretching was 8-9 levels in all 
interventions, the pain disappeared immediately after the post-measurements 
(median = 0).
CONCLUSION: The results suggested that muscle-tendon unit stiffness decreased 
regardless of duration of high-intensity static stretching. However, peak torque 
of isokinetic knee flexion decreased after 10 seconds of high-intensity static 
stretching, though it was no change after for more than 15 seconds of 
stretching.

Introduction Lipoma arborescens is a rare condition of the synovial lining. It 
is particularly uncommon in the bicipitoradial bursae of the elbow. Case Report 
A 68-year-old woman presented with a 5-month history of anterior elbow pain and 
swelling causing discomfort. Radiography demonstrated reactive changes of radial 
tuberosity and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed lipoma arborescens of the 
bicipitoradial bursa with distal biceps tendinopathy. A bicipital bursa 
bursectomy and lipoma excision was performed. Gross pathology and histology was 
consistent with lipoma arborescens. Three months postoperatively, our patient 
had full range of motion and good strength. Conclusions To our knowledge, this 
is the first published case report of lipoma arborescens affecting the elbow. 
Recognising the differential diagnoses of anterior elbow pain and the 
characteristic imaging is essential for accurate diagnosis.

Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue that lines the ends of bones in 
diarthrodial joints, serves as support, acts as a shock absorber, and 
facilitates joint's motion. It is formed by chondrocytes immersed in a dense 
extracellular matrix (principally composed of aggrecan linked to hyaluronic acid 
long chains). Damage to this tissue is usually associated with traumatic 
injuries or age-associated processes that often lead to discomfort, pain and 
disability in our aging society. Currently, there are few surgical alternatives 
to treat cartilage damage: the most commonly used is the microfracture 
procedure, but others include limited grafting or alternative chondrocyte 
implantation techniques, however, none of them completely restore a fully 
functional cartilage. Here we present the development of hydrogels based on 
hyaluronic acid and chitosan loaded with chondroitin sulfate by a new strategy 
of synthesis using biodegradable di-isocyanates to obtain an interpenetrated 
network of chitosan and hyaluronic acid for cartilage repair. These scaffolds 
act as delivery systems for the chondroitin sulfate and present mucoadhesive 
properties, which stabilizes the clot of microfracture procedures and promotes 
superficial chondrocyte differentiation favoring a true articular cellular 
colonization of the cartilage. This double feature potentially improves the 
microfracture technique and it will allow the development of next-generation 
therapies against articular cartilage damage.

BACKGROUND: Cervical facet joint disease is a common source of neck pain and its 
prevalence increases with aging. Conservative multimodal management options 
(e.g., strengthening of neck muscles, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medications, massage, and thermal modalities) often fail to relieve pain. 
Cervical medial branch nerve (CMBN) radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN) is an 
effective minimally invasive technique for treating chronic neck pain secondary 
to facet joint disease. An end-on approach for this procedure has been proposed 
that may be technically easier and require less time while reducing 
post-procedural discomfort. The protocol presented here is for a study that aims 
to compare the efficacy of a new end-on approach using multi-tined cannulae, 
against the conventional parallel technique that employs straight cannulae for 
RFN of the CMBN in patients with chronic neck pain due to cervical facet joint 
disease.
METHODS: A multicentre randomized, non-inferior, active comparator-controlled 
trial will be conducted with two parallel groups and blinding of participants 
and outcome assessor. The study will include 72 adults with chronic neck pain 
secondary to facet joint disease who are candidates for RFA of the CMBN. 
Participants will be randomized to either the conventional parallel or the 
end-on approach in a 1:1 ratio. The intensity of pain and pain-related domains 
(function, quality of life, sleep, adverse effects of the interventions, 
analgesic intake) will be measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the 
procedure.
DISCUSSION: Neck pain secondary to cervical facet joint disease is prevalent and 
RFA of the CMBN is a validated treatment for relieving it. The conventional 
parallel technique can be technically challenging, and it can be associated with 
adverse effects while the newer end-on approach has the potential of being a 
simpler technique with less adverse effects. This trial will be the first 
non-inferiority study to compare the clinical efficacy of the end-on approach 
against the conventional parallel approach for RFN of CMBN in patients with 
chronic neck pain due to cervical facet joint disease.

Kushtia-7003, Bangladesh. shahed.rajib@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: There are few menopausal study data available in South East Asia 
especially in Bangladesh. This study was conducted in a well populated town 
named Kushtia, which is located in the western part of Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to document the menopausal-related symptoms 
among middle age women of Kushtia region of Bangladesh.
METHODS: By using modified MRS (Menopause Rating Scale) questionnaire, 509 women 
aged 40-70 years were interviewed to document symptoms commonly associated with 
menopause.
FINDINGS: The mean age of menopause was 51.14 years. The most prevalent symptoms 
reported include, feeling tired (92.90%); headache (88.80%); joint and muscular 
discomfort (76.20%); physical and mental exhaustion (60.90%) and sleeplessness 
(54.40%) which are followed by depressive mood (37.30%); irritability (36%); 
dryness of vagina (36%); hot flushes and sweating (35.80%); anxiety (34.20%). 
However, noted less frequent symptoms were sexual problem (31.20%); cardiac 
discomfort (19.10%) and bladder problem (12.80%).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of menopausal symptoms found in this study 
correspond to other studies on Asian women however the prevalence of classical 
menopausal symptoms of hot flushes and sweating were lower compared to studies 
on Caucasian women.

BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the proximal humerus is essential for 
anatomical reconstruction of the glenohumeral joint during prosthetic 
replacement. The neck-shaft angle is critical for correct calcar screw 
positioning when fixing a proximal humeral fracture with a locking plate. It's 
essential for exact implant placement and treatment of any soft-tissue or bone 
pathology. Improper implants cause discomfort and post-operative complications, 
therefore understanding the humeral neck shaft angle is fundamental in the 
design and manufacturing of prostheses. This study looked into the necessity 
regional data of the humeral neck shaft angle (NSA) and its importance in 
shoulder prosthesis manufacturing.
METHOD: This cross-sectional investigation was conducted on 300 dry cadaveric 
humeri of unknown gender and age that were free of damage or deformity. The 
Goniometer was used to measure the neck shaft angle. The data was analysed using 
SPSS software. The standard deviation and mean were calculated. The statistical 
difference between the right and left humeri was assessed using the students' t' 
test.
OBSERVATIONS: The NSA of the humerus was 131.265.82° on average. The NSA mean 
values were substantially higher on the right side. A statistically significant 
difference between the right and left humeri was revealed by a P value of 0.001.
CONCLUSION: Success of the shoulder arthroplasty demands anatomical 
reconstruction of the normal neck-shaft angle of the humerus. Racial variations 
in the morphometry of the neck-shaft angle needs to be considered in prosthesis 
design.

[Between perception and reality: towards an assessment of socio-territorial 
discomfort in L'Aquila (Central Italy) after the earthquak].

OBJECTIVES: to consider perceptions and narratives of the inhabitants of 
L'Aquila about their context of life, in order to point out what kind of 
relationship is present in L'Aquila, between the territory and its inhabitants 
after the earthquake; to evaluate how and where symptomatic attitudes about a 
widespread discomfort in social interactions have been generalized.
DESIGN: since 2010, the joint work by the research team of the "Cartolab" 
laboratory and pedagogy area (Department of Human Studies, University of 
L'Aquila) has developed and applied a participatory research methodology. This 
methodology is both an inquiry used by experts to increase the participation of 
people who experience the everyday life in L'Aquila, and a tool to draw moral, 
ethical and political considerations in order to activate change in social and 
political dynamics at the urban scale. During 2013, the methodology of 
Participatory- Participating Research Action (PPRA) was implemented through 
cycles of territorial meetings involving citizens and municipal administrators. 
These meetings have been promoted and organized with the Office of Participation 
of the Municipality of L'Aquila.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the PPRA aimed to assess: 1. the social, political and 
economic quality of the territory evaluated by people involved in the survey, 
with reference to life conditions, living context, and future projections of 
self and of the territory; 2. the perception of the security. Through a 
qualitative/quantitative approach, the data collected through questionnaire and 
public meetings have involved 309 young (16-30 years old) and 227 adults (31-85 
years old) for the first aspect, and 314 citizens (16-80 years old) for the 
second aspect, respectively.
RESULTS: the results highlight a socioterritorial discomfort emerging in 
L'Aquila for a relevant part of the population. This discomfort is shaped by a 
negative rating on life conditions and context: adults provide poor quality 
evaluations about the present and cannot figure out some kind of vision for the 
future. From the point of view of young people, even though the spatial 
projection into the present appears more objective and pondered over real data, 
the projection into the future turns out even more pessimistic then the adults' 
one. Finally, the discomfort is shaped by a deterioration in the state of 
coexistence; and a high perception of insecurity, especially among those who 
live in the new residential earthquake- proofing complex called CASE.
CONCLUSIONS: the quality of the relationship inhabitantterritory has important 
consequences about the comfort of the population in the present and in the 
future. Such relationship may have an influence on individual and collective 
behaviours. Therefore, territorial and local governments are required to provide 
for measures preventing such discomfort. This implies to bring attention on 
topics that target individuals such as fear, loneliness, alcohol abuse, as well 
as communities, such as vandalism of public goods and spaces.

Aim: The goal of the present study was to analyze if the duration of pacifier 
use influenced the stomatognathic system in children that did not present any 
other parafunctional habits. Study design: Transversal cohort study. Material 
and Method: To collect data, a questionnaire was used and answered by the 
mothers of 90 children aged three to seven years old. Results: The children were 
divided into three groups: did not use pacifier; used pacifier until 2 years 
old; and used pacifier for more than 2 years. Greater prevalence of pain or 
discomfort in the stomatognathic system was observed among the children who had 
not used pacifier and the children who had used it for more than 2 years. The 
prevalence was smaller among the children who used pacifier until 2 years of 
age. Conclusion: Thus, it is concluded that pacifier is important to induce 
children to perform suction movements, preparing them to the introduction of 
solid foods. However, if used for a prolonged period of time, it may damage the 
joint and consequently the child's quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of counselling program versus counselling 
program plus jaw exercises to reduce pain and click in patients with 
temporomandibular joint disc displacement with reduction (DDWR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups: instructions for 
temporomandibular disorders (TMD) plus jaw exercises (test, n = 34), only TMD 
instructions (control, n = 34). Pain was analyzed by palpation (RDC/TMD). It was 
investigated if the click caused discomfort. Both groups were evaluated at 
baseline, 24 h, 7 days, and 30 days' post treatment.
RESULTS: The click was present in 85.7% (n = 60). In 30-day evaluation, there 
was a statistically significant difference between groups in the right median 
temporal muscle (p = 0.041); and there was a statistically significant 
difference in treatment self-perception (p = 0.002) and click's discomfort 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The exercise with recommendations showed better results, resolution 
of the click, and self-perception of the treatment effectiveness.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study presents therapeutic approaches that are easy to 
perform and that can be monitored remotely. In view of the current stage of the 
global pandemic, these treatment options become even more valid and useful.

INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular joints (TMJs) play a very significant function 
in the activity of the locomotor system of the masticatory system. But they are 
often a source of pain, myopathy, myoarthropathy, and malfunction of their 
surrounding or internal structures. The treatment of a patient's discomfort 
associated with masticatory system dysfunctions strongly depends on their cause. 
Aim of the Study. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of 
selected physical factors: LED light therapy with electromagnetic field and 
cryotherapy for the level of pain, in the treatment of patients suffering from 
temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 60 patients of both genders with 
diagnosed TMD in a clinical trial. The participants were randomly divided into 
two groups. Each group consisted of 30 people and was subjected to separate 
therapies in which LED light therapy with electromagnetic field (MLT) and 
cryotherapy (CT) were applied.
RESULTS: Having assessed the results of the author's own research in terms of 
analgesic activity, determined on the VAS scale during the daily routine 
activity of the mandible and its individual movements, in general, each of the 
studied groups demonstrated a considerable decrease in the level of the 
patients' perception of pain (<0.001). Having compared both the therapeutic 
methods used, a greater reduction in the level of perceived pain was achieved 
with MLT (p=0.002). The type of therapy used turned out to be the only 
significant factor for the magnitude of this reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions based on the results of our own research indicate that 
the selected methods of treatment demonstrate an analgesic effect in terms of 
the overall discomfort in the course of TMD, and that they may be an alternative 
pain relief thereby reducing the patient's intake of painkillers.

The geyser sign is the flow of arthrographic contrast or joint fluid from the 
glenohumeral joint across the acromioclavicular joint (AC) and occurs when fluid 
erupts from the superior aspect of the AC joint during arthrography. The cyst's 
pathogenesis is linked to a rotator cuff tear and an increase in the amount of 
fluid in the cyst. This fluid escapes through a one-way valve created by a 
defect in the AC joint capsule. The cysts, which are typically painless and rest 
over the AC joint, cause discomfort. We present a case of a 65-year-old female 
with a left shoulder mass. The patient presented to the outpatient department 
with a history of left shoulder mass for six months. She reported an increase in 
size with no constitutional symptoms. She was treated with surgical excision. 
Although rotator cuff tears and AC joint deterioration are rather common in 
medical practice, cystic swelling over the AC joint is a relatively uncommon 
symptom. Less than 50 cases have been reported to date. AC joint cyst is a 
mechanical consequence of a progressive and severe rotator cuff tear that can be 
misinterpreted as a tumor in older people. Imaging, particularly magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), should be used to rule out malignancy and make a 
precise diagnosis, including recognizing the "Geyser sign" if it is present.

INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs) are caused by several 
factors such as anatomical, neuromuscular and psychological alterations. A 
relationship has been established between TMJDs and postural alterations, a type 
of anatomical alteration. An anterior position of the head requires 
hyperactivity of the posterior neck region and shoulder muscles to prevent the 
head from falling forward. This compensatory muscular function may cause 
fatigue, discomfort and trigger point activation. To our knowledge, a method for 
assessing human postural attitude in more than one plane has not been reported. 
Thus, the aim of this study was to design a methodology to measure the external 
human postural attitude in frontal and sagittal planes, with proper validity and 
reliability analyses.
METHODS: The variable postures of 78 subjects (36 men, 42 women; age 18-24 
years) were evaluated. The postural attitudes of the subjects were measured in 
the frontal and sagittal planes, using an acromiopelvimeter, grid panel and Fox 
plane.
RESULTS: The method we designed for measuring postural attitudes had adequate 
reliability and validity, both qualitatively and quantitatively, based on 
Cohen's Kappa coefficient (> 0.87) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 
0.824, > 80%).
CONCLUSION: This method exhibits adequate metrical properties and can therefore 
be used in further research on the association of human body posture with 
skeletal types and TMJDs.

BACKGROUND: Several quality-of-life studies in patients awaiting major joint 
replacement have focused on the outcomes of surgery. Interest in examining 
patients on the elective waiting list has increased since the beginning of 2000. 
We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients waiting for total 
hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement in three Finnish hospitals, and compared 
patients' HRQoL with that of population controls.
METHODS: A total of 133 patients awaiting major joint replacement due to 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee joint were prospectively followed from 
the time the patient was placed on the waiting list to hospital admission. A 
sample of controls matched by age, gender, housing and home municipality was 
drawn from the computerised population register. HRQoL was measured by the 
generic 15D instrument. Differences between patients and the population controls 
were tested by the independent samples t-test and between the measurement points 
by the paired samples t-test. A linear regression model was used to explain the 
variance in the 15D score at admission.
RESULTS: At baseline, 15D scores were significantly different between patients 
and the population controls. Compared with the population controls, patients 
were worse off on the dimensions of moving (P < 0.001), sleeping (P < 0.001), 
sexual activity (P < 0.001), vitality (P < 0.001), usual activities (P < 0.001) 
and discomfort and symptoms (P < 0.001). Further, psychological 
factors--depression (P < 0.001) and distress (P = 0.004)--were worse among 
patients than population controls. The patients showed statistically 
significantly improved average scores at admission on the dimensions of moving 
(P = 0.026), sleeping (P = 0.004) and discomfort and symptoms (P = 0.041), but 
not in the overall 15D score compared with the baseline. In patients, 15D score 
at baseline (P < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.020) had an independent 
effect on patients' 15D score at hospital admission.
CONCLUSION: Although patients' HRQoL did not deteriorate while waiting, a 
consistently worse HRQoL was observed in patients waiting for major joint 
replacement compared with population controls.

Exerting a constant load would likely improve orthosis effectiveness in treating 
knee lateral deviations during childhood and early adolescence. Shape memory 
alloys are potential candidates for such applications due to their so called 
pseudoelastic effect. The present study aims to quantitatively define the 
applicable mechanical loads, in order to reduce treatment duration while 
avoiding tissular damage and patient discomfort. This is essential for 
performing a more efficient design of correction devices. We use a 
patient-specific finite elements model of a pediatric knee to determine safe 
loading levels. The achievable correction rates are estimated using a stochastic 
three-dimensional growth model. Results are compared against those obtained for 
a mechanical stimulus decreasing in proportion to the achieved correction, 
emulating the behavior of conventional orthoses. A constant flexor moment of 
1.1 Nm is estimated to change femorotibial angle at a rate of 
(7.4 ± 4.6) deg/year (mean ± std). This rate is similar to the achieved by more 
invasive growth modulation methods, and represents an improvement in the order 
of 25% in the necessary time for reducing deformities of (10 ± 5) deg by half, 
as compared with conventional orthoses.

As previous reports have highlighted that temporomandibular joint dysfunction 
syndrome can occur during scuba diving due to the use of a diving mouthpiece, 74 
divers of varied experience (62 male, 12 female) were asked to evaluate the 
efficiency of the mouthpiece for the ease of grip, insertion into the mouth, 
clearing of water, air sharing, comfort and overall efficiency. They also 
recorded the level of muscle and joint discomfort experienced during diving and 
non-diving activities. The results indicate that temporomandibular joint 
problems unrelated to diving are compounded by the use of a diving mouthpiece. 
The diver's assessment of muscle tension and comfort while using the mouthpiece 
was found to be a good predictor of whether temporomandibular dysfunction would 
occur and the assessment scores have been used in a formula to aid selection of 
a mouthpiece.

BACKGROUND: Demographic and epidemiological transitions have increased the life 
expectancy of middle aged women, resulting in higher burden of morbidities 
related to menopausal symptoms and also effect the quality of life (QOL).
OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and its effect on QOL 
among rural middle aged women (40-60 years) of Haryana, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in 
400 middle aged women (40-60 years) from April 2018 to March 2019 by random 
sampling technique. The menopause rating scale was used to assess the prevalence 
of menopausal symptoms and the QOL and data were collected for sociodemographic 
factors, relevant menstrual history and other variables.
RESULTS: Prevalence of menopausal symptoms was found to be 87.7%. Majority of 
the study subjects had anxiety (80%), followed by physical and mental exhaustion 
(71.5%), sleep problem (61.2%), irritability (60.7%), Joint and muscular 
discomfort (56%) and heart problems (54%). The most classical symptom of 
menopause i.e., hot flushes were reported in 36.7%. The mean age of menopause 
was 47.53 standard deviation 4.5 years. Statistical significant difference was 
seen for the mean score of few symptoms i.e., hot flushes, sweating (P < 0.003) 
and joint and muscular discomfort (P < 0.014) between post and peri-menopausal 
groups. The QOL was impaired in 70.2% of study subjects. The psychological 
symptoms attributed 70.8% to the poor QOL.
CONCLUSION: To improve the QOL and to decrease the menopausal symptoms in these 
women, a holistic approach in the form of lifestyle and behavioral modification 
are required.

The primary purpose of our study was to assess the influence of modulating 
sensory input with either transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or 
self-massage with therapy balls on the maximal range of motion (ROM) about the 
ankle joint when stretching the calf muscles. We also investigated the influence 
of these two conditions on the force capacity and force control of plantar 
flexor muscles. Twenty healthy adults (25 ± 3 yr) performed three sessions of 
ankle plantar flexor stretching (three stretches of 30 s each): stretching alone 
(SS), stretching with concurrent TENS (TENS), and stretching after self-massage 
using therapy balls (SM). TENS was applied for 60 s prior to and during each 
stretch, and SM was performed for 60 s prior to each of the three stretches. 
Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque and force steadiness at 20% MVC were 
recorded before and at 15 min after the final stretch. Ankle dorsiflexion ROM 
was assessed before, after, and at 5, 10, and 15 min after the last stretch. The 
increase in ROM was greater after SM (24%) than after SS (13%) and TENS (9%; 
p < .001). Maximal discomfort level (0-10 VAS) during stretching was similar for 
all conditions. MVC torque increased after SM only (p < .001, Cohen's D = 1.5): 
SM, 16%; SS, -1%; TENS, -3%. Force steadiness did not change. The sensory fibres 
that contribute to stretch tolerance were engaged by self-massage but not by 
TENS, resulting in greater increases in flexibility and MVC torque after 
self-massage.

Acromioclavicular joint dislocations often occur in athletic, young patients 
after blunt force to the shoulder. Several static and dynamic operative 
procedures with or without primary ligament replacement have been described. 
Between February 2003 and March 2009 we treated 313 patients suffering from 
Rockwood III-V lesions of the AC joint with an AC-hook plate. 225 (72 %) of 
these patients could be followed up. Mean operation time was 42 minutes in the 
conventional group and 47 minutes in the minimal invasive group. The 
postoperative pain on a scale from 1 to 10 (VAS-scale) was rated 2.7 in the 
conventional group and 2.2 in the minimal invasive group. Taft score showed very 
good and good results in 189 patients (84%). Constant score showed an average of 
92.4 of 100 possible points with 89 % excellent and good results and 11 % 
satisfying results. All patients had some degree of pain or discomfort with the 
hook-plate in place. These symptoms were relieved after removal of the plate. 
The overall complication rate was 10.6 %. There were 6 superficial soft tissue 
infections, 1 fracture of the acromion, 7 redislocations after removal of the 
hook-plate. We observed 4 broken hooks which could be removed at the time of 
plate removal, 4 seromas and 2 cases of lateral clavicle bone infection, which 
required early removal of the plate. We can conclude that clavicle hook plate is 
a convenient device for the surgical treatment of Rockwood Grade III-V 
dislocations, giving good mid-term results with a low overall complication rate 
compared to the literature. Early functional therapy is possible and can avoid 
limitations in postoperative shoulder function.

INTRODUCTION: The principal objective of the present study was to compare rates 
of postoperative discomfort after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
reconstruction between inpatient (In) and outpatient (Out) management.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: A single-surgeon non-randomized prospective comparative 
study included patients undergoing primary surgery for isolated ACL tear by 
short hamstring graft in 2012-13. The Out group comprised patients eligible for 
and consenting to outpatient surgery and the In group, those not eligible or not 
consenting. The principal assessment criterion was onset of at least 1 symptom 
of postoperative discomfort (SPD): anxiety, nausea and vomiting, malaise, 
vertigo or stomach pain, between postoperative days 0 and 3. Secondary 
assessment criteria were difficulty in getting to sleep, getting up during the 
night, regular walking or going out, number of episodes of knee pain and waking 
because of pain. All criteria were assessed on-line by the patient.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients filled out the questionnaire, 70 
in the Out group and 63 in the In group; 42 females, 91 males; mean age, 30±9 
years. Between D0 and D3, the proportion of patients with ≥l SPD was comparable 
between groups (Out 37% vs In 41%, P=0.62). Out-group patients had significantly 
less difficulty sleeping the first postoperative night (P=0.01), got up 
significantly more often during the first night after surgery (P<0.0001), more 
often walked regularly on day 1 (P=0.03), and were significantly less often 
woken by pain during the first night (P=0.003). Risk factors for SPD were female 
gender (OR=4.8±1.9) and postoperative complications (OR=3.8±2.5).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction on an outpatient basis did 
not show more symptoms of postoperative discomfort than those managed as 
conventional inpatients.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are conditions that are caused 
and/or aggravated by work. The most important reason behind work-related 
musculoskeletal disorder is abnormal and/or stressful position of joints while 
working. Physiotherapists are very much prone to develop work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders, especially while treating neurologically challenged 
patients. Postural assessment is a key to identify a person at risk of 
developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Proper assessment of some of 
the areas like neck, spine, upper and lower extremities is the key to get risk 
factor analysis. REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) is a tool which can be used 
on field to quantify areas of the body which are more likely to develop 
work-related musculoskeletal disorders.
AIMS: To find out risk of MSDs among physiotherapists treating neurologically 
challenged patients.
STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: At neuro-paediatric department of SBB College of 
Physiotherapy, an observational pilot study was conducted.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Photographs of the participants were captured with their 
consent through smart phone camera during treatment of different patients both 
adult and paediatric. Selected postures were analysed and quantified based on 
the REBA sheet.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis was done based on areas at higher 
risk for MSDs according to REBA sheet.
RESULTS: More than 50% of participants were at moderate to high risk of 
developing MSDs.
CONCLUSION: Physiotherapists working with neurological patients were found to be 
at high to medium risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. There is a 
need to assess MSD risk in detail in all physiotherapists.

Musculoskeletal disorders are common conditions involving joints, muscles, 
nerves, ligaments and tendons. These disorders affect normal activities and 
cause discomfort. These discomforts are managed by different types of 
interventions, including exercise, acupuncture, soft tissue release and manual 
therapy, as conservative modes of management. Soft tissue release, including 
active release technique, fascial abrasion, and myo-fascial release are 
considered effective for musculoskeletal function improvement. Advanced 
technology-improved and instrument-assisted techniques are being used nowadays. 
These instruments are sensitive in the localisation, specification and 
facilitation of the target area with the help of mechanical pressure applied on 
tissue with movement of specific muscle. Prognosis varies with good outcomes 
using fewer sessions than the others. But it needs proper localisation of the 
muscle involved and special training. The advantage considered is that 
musculoskeletal disorders can also be prevented in practitioners as well.

OBJECTIVES: The prevalence and appearance of sesamoid bones in the foot vary 
considerably among different populations and ethnic groups. We sought to 
evaluate the prevalence and distribution patterns of foot sesamoid bones among 
Omani patients referred for radiological investigation.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among patients who had been referred 
for foot X-ray from January to December 2018. We used the chi-square test to 
determine the gender and age influence on the prevalence of sesamoid bones, and 
the Spearman's correlation coefﬁcient to assess the coincidence of speciﬁc 
distributions of sesamoid bones at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints.
RESULTS: A total of 774 foot radiographs composed of 442 right foot radiographs 
and 332 left foot radiographs were reviewed for the presence of sesamoid bones 
at MTP and interphalangeal (IP) joints of the foot. We observed a high 
prevalence rate of sesamoid bones at the fifth MTP joint (13.7%), and first IP 
of the great toe (9.9%). There were nine distinctive patterns of sesamoid bones. 
The coincidence of sesamoid bones at two or more MTP joints was 14.6%, with a 
high prevalence rate at first and fifth MTP joints (10.3%). Moreover, the 
prevalence rate of sesamoid bones increased with increasing age at the fifth MTP 
joint.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of sesamoid bones in the foot is considerably high 
in Omani subjects and needs further prospective studies. Meanwhile, our findings 
could be helpful for clinicians to consider ailments of sesamoid bones during 
differential diagnosis in Omani patients who present with foot pain and 
discomfort.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: No deformity of the forefoot occurs more frequently than 
hallux valgus (HV), which is considered to be medial deviation of the first 
metatarsal and lateral deviation and rotation of the hallux, either with or 
without medial soft tissue enlargement of the metatarsal head. The HV deformity 
can lead to painful motion of the joint or difficulty in daily joint activity 
that often requires surgical correction. The aims of this study were to 
investigate the levels of foot pain and quality of life of patients with HV 
before and after surgery. Our study is focusing on imagistic investigations in 
HV, clinical aspects, specific treatment, foot pain levels, quality of life and 
general health before and after surgery.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our research was conducted in the period 
2010-2015. We recruited 56 patients, 35 women and 21 men, age range 20 to 76 
years, mean age 44.4 years, with HV (radiographic HV angle 25-40 and >40). We 
applied Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for the foot pain and the Euro Quality of 
Life - five dimensions health questionnaire (EQ-5D).
RESULTS: The results show statistically significant differences concerning the 
foot pain levels in VAS and also pain/discomfort, mobility and 
anxiety÷depression in the EQ-5D subscale in HV before and after surgery. The 
results prove high improvement of the scores of foot pain, discomfort, mobility 
and anxiety÷depression after surgery. Concerning the participation in usual 
activities and the self-care, the obtained results were not statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research was a proof that the surgery in HV represents a 
fruitful pathway of intervention and care and shows a high rate of success, 
favorable outcomes and improvement in quality of life of the patients.

Three-dimensional video services delivered through wireless communication 
channels have to deal with numerous challenges due to the limitations of both 
the transmission channel's bandwidth and receiving devices. Adverse channel 
conditions, delays, or jitters can result in bit errors and packet losses, which 
can alter the appearance of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) video. Due to the perception 
of dissimilar patterns by the two human eyes, they can not be fused into a 
stable composite pattern in the brain and hence try to dominate by suppressing 
each other. Thus, a psychovisual sensation that is called binocular rivalry 
occurs. As a result, undetectable changes causing irritating flickering effects 
are seen, leading to visual discomforts such as eye strain, headache, nausea, 
and weariness. This study addresses the observer's quality of experience (QoE) 
by analyzing the binocular rivalry impact on the macroblock (MB) losses in a 
frame and its error propagation due to predictive frame encoding in stereoscopic 
video transmission systems. To simulate the processing of experimental videos, 
the Joint Test Model (JM) reference software has been used as it is recommended 
by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Existing error concealing 
techniques were then applied to the contiguous lost MBs for a variety of 
transmission impairments. In order to validate the authenticity of the simulated 
packet loss environment, several objective evaluations were carried out. 
Standard numbers of subjects were then engaged in the subjective testing of 
common 3D video sequences. The results were then statistically examined using a 
standard Student's t-test, allowing the impact of binocular rivalry to be 
compared to that of a non-rivalry error condition. The major goal is to assure 
error-free video communication by minimizing the negative impacts of binocular 
rivalry and boosting the ability to efficiently integrate 3D video material to 
improve viewers' overall QoE.

Introduction: Strontium ranelate (SrRan) has the potential to interfere in the 
progression of osteoarthritis (OA), multifactorial disease associated with 
mechanical problems and articular inflammatory changes. Objectives: This study 
aimed to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic use of SrRan on 
clinical parameters of pain, the inflammatory process, and degradation of the 
articular cartilage. Methods: This was an experimental study, using a model of 
knee OA induced by intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate. Thirty Wistar 
rats were divided into five groups and treated as indicated: control, without 
intervention; prophylactic, received SrRan at a daily oral dose of 250 mg/kg for 
28 days before OA induction; SrRan treatments, administered 250 or 500 mg/kg/day 
for 28 days after the induction; and model control, received saline solution 
after the induction. Behavioral tests (joint incapacity, mechanical 
hyperalgesia, tactile sensitivity, and forced ambulation), histological 
evaluation of articular cartilage, and determination of inflammatory cytokines 
in the synovial fluid (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, 
and interferon [INF]-γ) were performed. Results: Both prophylactic and 
therapeutic treatments improved the articular discomfort. A prophylactic dose of 
500 mg/kg/day also improved mechanical hyperalgesia and the same dose was 
beneficial on tactile sensitivity. SrRan did not improve ambulation. Levels of 
IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in SrRan-treated groups with OA were not 
significantly different compared with those in the normal control animals. The 
histopathological evaluation showed less articular damage in the SrRan-treated 
and control groups compared to the saline-treated group. Conclusion: The 
prophylactic and therapeutic administration of SrRan was associated with 
improved behavioral patterns of pain, especially joint discomfort. SrRan 
administration mitigated histological changes in the articular cartilage and 
reduced the inflammatory process, which beneficially reduced the progression of 
OA in the experimental model studied.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease 
that primarily affects joints with some extraarticular involvement. If 
inappropriately treated, it usually results in persistent joint pain, 
irreversible deformities, and functional disability, leading to poor quality of 
life. Our objective was to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
related factors in patients with RA.
METHODS: Four hundred sixty-four patients from the Rheumatoid Arthritis 
registries of Siriraj and Phramongkutklao teaching hospitals were enrolled. 
Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data related to disease activity, and 
functional status were collected. HRQoL was assessed using the Thai version of 
EuroQol five dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) and EQ global health visual 
analogue scale (EQ VAS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to 
identify factors related to HRQoL.
RESULTS: Eighty-five percent were female with a mean age ± SD of 
59.15 ± 11.43 years and a mean disease duration ± SD of 11.53 ± 8.3 years. The 
mean educational level ± SD was 9.42 ± 5.21 years. Almost half were unemployed 
or retired (47%). They had moderate disease activity (mean cumulative 
DAS28 ± SD, 3.5 ± 0.8) and mild functional impairment (mean HAQ ± SD, 
0.70 ± 0.68). The mean EQ-5D ± SD (0-1) was 0.87 ± 0.13 and mean EQ VAS ± SD 
(0-10) was 7.94 ± 1.7. Based on the EQ-5D domain, 49% reported that they had no 
problem with mobility, 83% had no difficulties with self-care, 65% had no 
difficulties with usual activity, 30% had no pain or discomfort, and 61% had no 
depression or anxiety. The relationship between problems of each dimension in 
EQ-5D significantly increased according to severity of RA assessed by the 
Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) 
(p <  0.01). In multivariate analyses, high cumulative disease activity, 
functional disability, depression, and anxiety were negatively associated with 
EQ-5D (adjusted R 2 0.38, p <  0.001) and EQ VAS (adjusted R 2 0.19, 
p <  0.001).
CONCLUSION: Disease severity and psychological disturbance have a negative 
impact on quality of life in patients with RA. These factors should be 
considered in management of RA patients to improve the standard of care.

BACKGROUND: Inadvertent intravascular injection of local anesthetics can lead to 
false negative results following a lumbar medial branch block (MBB) performed to 
diagnose facet joint origin pain. A previous study demonstrated that the type of 
needle could affect the incidence of intravascular injection rates.
OBJECTIVES: The primary endpoint of this study was to compare the incidence of 
intravascular injection during lumbar MBB between the Quincke and Touhy needles. 
The secondary endpoint of this study was to compare the injection time, 
radiation dose, and patient discomfort during lumbar MBB between the needle 
types.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial.
SETTING: An interventional pain management practice in South Korea.
METHODS: The incidence of intravascular uptake of contrast medium was compared 
using the Touhy and Quincke needles under real-time fluoroscopy during lumbar 
MBB. Injection time, radiation dose, and patient discomfort during lumbar MBB 
were also compared.
RESULTS: The incidence of intravascular injection was 21.8% (21/102) in the 
Touhy needle group and 21.2% (22/99) in the Quincke needle group. The odds ratio 
for the association between the needle types and intravascular injection was 
1.1. The injection time, radiation dose, and patient discomfort during lumbar 
MBB were similar between the Touhy and Quincke needle groups.
LIMITATIONS: This study was performed from L2 to L4 MBB of the unilateral lumbar 
region. Although the type of needle assigned to the patient was randomized, 3 
needles, which are used for 3 levels of MBB, were identical.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence rate of intravascular injection during lumbar 
MBB was nearly 20% under real-time fluoroscopy for both types of needle. Use of 
the Touhy needle did not reduce the intravascular injection rate nor the 
injection time, radiation dose, and patient discomfort.

A 64-year-old lady with a background of rheumatoid arthritis presented to the 
foot and ankle clinic with lump underneath the sole of her foot causing 
significant discomfort. Examination revealed she had a swelling of the first and 
the second metatarsophalangeal joints. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 
abnormal soft tissue thickening between the second and the third metatarsal and 
a single large encapsulating indeterminate soft tissue mass with a peripheral 
inflammatory rim. The appearance was suggestive of a malignant sarcoma rather 
than a rheumatoid nodule or rheumatoid tenosynovitis. The patient was referred 
to the regional sarcoma unit where the scans were reviewed, and a sarcoma was 
ruled out. The patient then underwent excision of the indeterminate soft tissue 
mass. Histology revealed granulomatous infiltration suggestive of a rheumatoid 
nodule. This has not been described previously in the literature.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we present our experiences with local injections of 
triamcinolone and prilocaine in patients diagnosed with Tietze syndrome.
METHODS: Between January 2016 and January 2019, a total of 28 patients (12 
males, 16 females; median age: 33 years; range, 21 to 51 years) who were 
diagnosed with TS in our clinic were retrospectively analyzed. Triamcinolone 
hexacetonide and prilocaine hydrochloride were injected into painful joints. At 
first week, pain sensation of the patients was recorded using the Pain Rating 
Scale developed by the British Pain Society. Pain was also assessed at one, two, 
and three weeks after injections qualitatively and based on physical 
examination.
RESULTS: At one week, the pain severity before the local injection treatment was 
above average the pain-related discomfort rates, and the response was quite 
favorable after the treatment (p=0.005 and p=0.001, respectively). A 
statistically significant rating was observed for treatment response and success 
(p=0.003). Totally 75% of the patients experienced more than 70% reduction in 
pain level after the injection.
CONCLUSION: Our treatment approach involving injection of a mixture of steroid 
and a local anesthetic provides a rapid relief from pain, irrespective of age, 
sex, or employment status in patients diagnosed with Tietze syndrome.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the performance of a new multi-degree-of-freedom 
articulating laparoscopic instrument, ArtiSential, and compared it with that of 
a straight-shaped instrument and the da Vinci surgical system, in renal surgery 
using porcine model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine female Yorkshire pigs were equally divided into 
three groups. The three groups were compared at each surgical step in terms of 
objective and subjective parameters.
RESULTS: The median operative times for renal pedicle clamping and ureter 
dissection were significantly shorter in ArtiSential group than robotic group 
(1.3 min vs. 4.7 min, p=0.002; 8.1 min vs. 11.1 min, p=0.015). The median 
operative time for bladder repair was significantly longer in ArtiSential group 
than robotic and straight-shaped groups (17.9 min vs. 5.5 min, p=0.002; 17.9 min 
vs. 9.3 min, p=0.026). There were no significant differences among groups in 
terms of blood loss or intraoperative complications. ArtiSential device was less 
useable for renorrhaphy (p=0.009) and bladder repair (p=0.002) compared to the 
robotic system. ArtiSential group was less accurate than robotic group in terms 
of tumor resection, renorrhaphy, and bladder repair. During ureter dissection, 
bladder cuff excision, and bladder repair, the surgeon experienced greater wrist 
discomfort but lesser back discomfort in ArtiSential group than robotic group.
CONCLUSIONS: For most steps, ArtiSential performed as well as robotic and 
straight-shaped instruments. The development of specialized surgical techniques 
for ArtiSential will maximize the advantages of these instruments.

College, Karachi, PAK.

Open de-gloving hand injuries with exposed tendons and bones require coverage by 
a flap. Conventionally used groin or abdominal flaps are cumbersome to patients 
due to extensive dressing and prolonged passive positioning of the hand until 
pedicle division. Superficial circumflex iliac artery (SCIA) flap is evolved 
from a traditional groin flap, and because of its thinness, pliability, and 
concealed donor site, it is an ideal option for single-stage reconstruction of 
traumatic hand defects avoiding discomforting passive hand position, joint 
stiffness, and unexpected flap avulsion which were associated with traditional 
groin flap. All patients with exposed bones or tendons due to traumatic hand 
injuries who opted for free flap coverage during the year 2018 to 2020 were 
enrolled in our study. After initial debridement, the wound was covered with a 
free SCIA flap. Duration of hospital stay, days out of work, the number of 
dressings required, postoperative complications, and any secondary procedures 
for flap readjustment were noted till six months postoperatively. A total of 
eight patients were included in the study. The mechanism of injury was road 
traffic accidents in a single patient and occupational injury in eight patients. 
The average duration of hospital stay was six days after reconstructive surgery. 
The average number of dressings a patient had was 18, and only two patients 
required flap thinning. Only one patient had a postoperative infection which was 
managed with dressings and antibiotics. One patient had peripheral flap 
necrosis. We had zero flap re-exploration. Therefore, we conclude that hand 
defects coverage with SCIA flap leads to a smaller number of working days lost 
and rarely requires secondary procedures.

BACKGROUND: AO clavicular hook plates have been widely used for treating 
acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation and distal clavicle fractures. Many 
complications have been reported, and many patients have complained about the 
discomfort of the plate. However, no study on the impact of clavicular hook 
plates in AC joint 3D printing models has been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the matching performance of hook plates with different 
hook depths when they were implanted in 3D printing models of normal Chinese AC 
joints and to propose a further design to achieve a better match.
METHODS: AO clavicular hook plates with two different hook depths of 15 mm and 
18 mm were implanted in 3D printing models of forty Chinese normal AC joints. 
The angle between the distal clavicle and plate (CPA) and the drop between 
acromion and distal clavicle (ACD) of normal AC joints with and without plates 
were measured.
RESULTS: Mismatch was found when the hook plates were implanted, with an average 
CPA of 18.8 ± 5.1° with the 15-mm hook plate and 10.2 ± 4.9° with the 18-mm hook 
plate. To eliminate the CPA, the ACD decreased by 6.3 ± 1.1 mm with the 15-mm 
hook plate and 2.9 ± 0.9 mm with the 18-mm hook plate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that AO clavicular hook plates with different 
hook depths were very likely to result in over-reduction of the AC joint. It is 
necessary to bend the hook angle to fit the patient's AC joint to achieve 
accurate reduction.

Surgical management of pivot-shift phenomenon in a dog.

Knight RC, Thomson DG, Danielski A.

CASE DESCRIPTION A 6.8-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever-Poodle mix was 
evaluated because of continued left pelvic limb lameness unresponsive to 
conservative management 1 year after undergoing tibial plateau leveling 
osteotomy (TPLO). CLINICAL FINDINGS A jerking lateral movement of the left 
stifle joint was detected during walking. Orthopedic examination revealed a 
pivot-shift phenomenon (PSP). Palpation elicited no signs of discomfort over the 
TPLO plate or caudomedial aspect of the stifle joint. Radiography revealed 
complete bone fusion at the osteotomy site and only mild joint effusion. 
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Arthrotomy was performed at the medial aspect of the 
stifle joint, revealing no meniscal tears. The previously applied plate was 
removed, and an extracapsular, synthetic, ligament-like biomaterial was placed 
to counteract internal tibial rotation, thereby eliminating the PSP. Six weeks 
later, lameness had improved considerably with no evidence of PSP; 8 weeks after 
surgery, the dog was assessed for sudden-onset lameness in the right pelvic 
limb. Cranial cruciate ligament rupture was suspected, and TPLO was performed. 
The PSP was identified intraoperatively, so an extracapsular implant was placed. 
Six weeks later, the dog had only mild lameness and no evidence of PSP in either 
pelvic limb. In a follow-up telephone conversation 1 year later, the owner 
reported no obvious lameness or gait abnormalities. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of an 
extracapsular implant effectively eliminated the PSP following TPLO in the dog 
of this report and can be considered as an intra- or postoperative option for 
dogs with PSP that responds poorly to conservative management.

BACKGROUND: One of the potential side effects with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) 
includes painful cutaneous dysesthesias and increased pain due to neuritis or 
neurogenic inflammation. This pain may require the prescription of opioids or 
non-opioid analgesics to control post-procedural pain and discomfort.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to compare post-procedural pain scores and 
post-procedural oral analgesic use in patients receiving continuous thermal 
radiofrequency ablation versus patients receiving pulsed dose radiofrequency 
immediately followed by continuous thermal radiofrequency ablation for 
zygopophaseal joint disease.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled 
trial. Patients who met all the inclusion criteria and were not subject to any 
of the exclusion criteria were required to have two positive diagnostic medial 
branch blocks prior to undergoing randomization, intervention, and analysis.
SETTING: University hospital.
METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive 
thermal radiofrequency ablation alone (standard group) or pulsed dose 
radiofrequency (PDRF) immediately followed by thermal radiofrequency ablation 
(investigational group), all of which were performed by a single Board Certified 
Pain Medicine physician. Post-procedural pain levels between the two groups were 
assessed using the numerical pain Scale (NPS), and patients were contacted by 
phone on post-procedural days 1 and 2 in the morning and afternoon regarding the 
amount of oral analgesic medications used in the first 48 hours following the 
procedure.
RESULTS: Patients who received pulsed dose radiofrequency followed by continuous 
radiofrequency neurotomy reported statistically significantly lower 
post-procedural pain scores in the first 24 hours compared to patients who 
received thermal radiofrequency neurotomy alone. These patients also used less 
oral analgesic medication in the post-procedural period.
LIMITATIONS: These interventions were carried out by one board accredited pain 
physician at one center. The procedures were exclusively performed using one 
model of radiofrequency generator, at one setting for the PDRF and RFA. The 
difference in the number of levels of ablation was not considered in the 
analysis of the results.
CONCLUSION: Treating patients with pulsed dose radiofrequency prior to 
continuous thermal radiofrequency ablation can provide patients with less 
post-procedural pain during the first 24 hours and also reduce analgesic 
requirements. Furthermore, the addition of PDRF to standard thermal RFA did not 
prolong the time of standard thermal radiofrequency ablation procedures, as it 
was performed during the typically allotted time for local anesthetic action.

Carvil, PA, Attias, J, Evetts, SN, Waldie, JM, and Green, DA. The effect of the 
gravity loading countermeasure skinsuit upon movement and strength. J Strength 
Cond Res 31(1): 154-161, 2017-Effective countermeasures against musculoskeletal 
deconditioning induced by microgravity and disuse are required. A simple 
alternative to provision of artificial gravity by centrifugation is compressive 
axial loading. The Russian "Pingvin" suit was the first wearable suit to apply 
this concept using bungee cords tethered around the shoulders and feet. However, 
poor loading characteristics and severe thermal and movement discomfort were 
reported. The gravity loading countermeasure skinsuit (GLCS) uses a 
bidirectional weave to generate staged axial loading from shoulders to feet, 
better mimicking how Earth's gravity induces progressive loading head to foot. 
The Mk III GLCS's loading was evaluated and tolerability assessed during maximal 
joint motion, ambulation, and selected strength exercises. Eight subjects (5 
male and 3 female; 28 ± 3 years; 179 ± 0.1 cm and 74.8 ± 2.9 kg), having given 
written informed consent, had an Mk III GLCS individually tailored. Axial 
loading imparted, body height, joint range of motion (ROM), ambulation, and 
strength tests (12 repetition maximum) were performed in the GLCS and gym 
attire, with subjective (rating of perceived exertion, thermal comfort, movement 
discomfort and body control) ratings recorded throughout. Gravity loading 
countermeasure skinsuit provided significant axial loading when standing but 
significantly reduced knee (-13°), spinal (-28°) and shoulder flexion/extension 
ROM (-34°/-13°), in addition to Sit and Reach (-12.8 cm). No thermal issues were 
reported but there was an increase in subjective discomfort. Gravity loading 
countermeasure skinsuit did not significantly impede strength exercise, with the 
exception of shoulder press. The GLCS (Mk III) demonstrates potential as a 
countermeasure by providing tolerable, static axial loading. Furthermore, it may 
serve as an elasticlike strength exercise adjunct, which may have utility as a 
rehabilitation modality after further design refinement.

Background: Cystic lesions of the carpal bones are rare entities that are 
infrequently reported in the literature. Scaphoid intraosseous cystic lesions 
represent a rare subset of carpal bone cysts. This review aims to summarize the 
available evidence on the evaluation and treatment of scaphoid cystic lesions to 
help guide clinical management. Methods: Systematic electronic searches were 
performed using PubMed, Ovid, and Embase databases. Studies included were graded 
for their risk of bias. Pooled descriptive statistics were performed on 
incidence, etiology, physical exam findings, treatment, and follow-up. Results: 
A total of 38 patients representing 41 scaphoid cystic lesions were pooled from 
27 articles. Patients presented with wrist pain without fracture (n = 27), 
pathological fracture (n = 9), swelling only (n = 1), or were asymptomatic (n = 
4). Cystic lesions of the scaphoid were initially revealed on imaging with 
radiographs alone (n = 22), radiographs in combination with computed tomography 
(CT) (n = 10) or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 6), CT alone (n = 1), or using 
all 3 modalities (n = 2). Intraosseous ganglia were identified most frequently 
(n = 31), followed by "bone cyst-like pathological change" (n = 3), unicameral 
bone cysts (n = 2), aneurysmal bone cysts (n = 2), primary hydatid cysts (n = 
2), and cystic like changes post fall (n = 1). Treatment modalities included 
curettage and bone graft (n = 39) or below-elbow cast (n = 2). On follow-up 
(average of 21.3 months; n = 40), all patients improved clinically after 
treatment and were found to have full wrist range of motion without pain (n = 
31), slightly reduced grip strength (n = 3), limited range of motion (n = 2), or 
persistent mild discomfort (n = 2). Conclusions: Scaphoid cystic lesions are 
most commonly intraosseous ganglia, but can include other etiologies as well. 
The main presenting symptom is radial wrist pain that usually resolves after 
treatment. The presence of intracarpal cystic lesions should be considered in 
the differential diagnosis of wrist pain.

BACKGROUND: Purpose of this study was to modify the stethoscope which can 
auscultate the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sounds more precisely than 
conventional stethoscope, and fabrication of stethoscope compatible software 
which analyses the auscultated sound and gives documentary evidence of that 
analysis in the form of graph.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The conventional stethoscope was modified by attaching a 
custom made soundscope with a recording device which can be placed in external 
auditory meatus (EAM) for auscultation of TMJ sounds. When this small and smooth 
end of custom made soundscope of modified stethoscope is placed in EAM & 
connected with specially developed software it records the TMJ sounds & analyzes 
them in form of graph.
RESULTS: Fabrication of modified stethoscope with software records the 
auscultated sound as a sound wave in form of graph and analyses this sound wave 
graph to give graphic evidence of prominent intensity at prominent frequency as 
spectrum analysis graph, and duration of that sound as a sound length graph.
CONCLUSION: The use of modified stethoscope with software increases the accuracy 
of auscultation of TMJ sounds without any patient's discomfort and helps in 
diagnosis of TMJ disorders. The modified stethoscope with software for 
auscultation of TMJ sounds results in more precise auscultation & analysis of 
TMJ for sounds even of low intensity & frequency. How to cite the article: Dagar

Pillar pain represents one of the most common complications of classic open 
carpal tunnel release (CTR). This complication causes a sense of discomfort 
worse than the compression syndrome itself. We, herein, introduce a new 
treatment method for CTR through a mini-incision, which allows subcutaneously 
cutting the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) and releasing the median nerve 
without neurovascular complications. This mini-incision approach can allow the 
direct visualization and preservation of the thenar motor branch in those rare 
cases where it has an aberrant origin. For the past 10 years, we have 
consecutively performed this technique in the surgical treatment of 318 patients 
with the diagnosis of primary CTS, without developing any neurovascular and 
tendon injuries as well as pillar pain.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the morphologies of congenital C2-3 synostosis in 25 
patients.
METHODS: Radiographs of 11 males and 14 females aged 5 to 74 years with 
congenital C2-3 synostosis were reviewed. All cases were found incidentally on 
radiographs when presenting with neck/shoulder discomfort/pain.
RESULTS: 13 of the patients had spondylosis in 21 segments: C1-2 (n=1) and C3-4 
(n=1), C4-5 (n=7), C5-6 (n=9), and C6-7 (n=3). Of whom 12 had normal sagittal 
alignment and one had kyphotic synostosis (who developed compensatory 
hyperlordosis of the caudal mobile segments and subsequent spondylosis at C3-4 
and C5 retrolisthesis). The remaining 12 patients had no spondylosis and had 
normal sagittal alignment, but had other associated pathologies including disc 
herniation at C3-4, C1 ring hypoplasia, and calcification of the nuchal 
ligament.
CONCLUSION: Normally aligned congenital synostosis of C2-3 is rarely associated 
with a junctional problem, whereas a kyphotic synostosis is associated with a 
caudal junctional problem. Spondylosis developing after age 40 years is not 
associated with C2-3 synostosis.

Complex diseases are often reported along with disease-related traits (DRT). 
Sometimes investigators consider both disease and DRT phenotypes separately and 
sometimes they consider individuals as affected if they have either the disease 
or the DRT, or both. We propose instead to consider the joint distribution of 
the disease and the DRT and do a linkage analysis assuming a pleiotropic model. 
We evaluated our results through analysis of the simulated datasets provided by 
Genetic Analysis Workshop 14. We first conducted univariate linkage analysis of 
the simulated disease, Kofendrerd Personality Disorder and one of its simulated 
associated traits, phenotype b (fear/discomfort with strangers). Subsequently, 
we considered the bivariate phenotype, which combined the information on 
Kofendrerd Personality Disorder and fear/discomfort with strangers. We developed 
a program to perform bivariate linkage analysis using an extension to the 
Elston-Stewart peeling method of likelihood calculation. Using this program we 
considered the microsatellites within 30 cM of the gene pleiotropic for this 
simulated disease and DRT. Based on 100 simulations of 300 families we observed 
excellent power to detect linkage within 10 cM of the disease locus using the 
DRT and the bivariate trait.

The Indian Ocean chikungunya epidemic re-emerged in Thailand in August 2008. 
Forty-five adults with laboratory-confirmed chikungunya in Songkhla province, 
Thailand were clinically assessed and serially bled throughout the acute and 
convalescent phase of the disease. Patient symptoms, antibody responses, and 
viral kinetics were evaluated using observational assessments, polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), and serological assays. All subjects experienced joint pain with 
42 (93%) involving multiple joints; the interphalangeal most commonly affected 
in 91% of the subjects. The mean duration of joint pain was 5.8 days, 11 (25%) 
experiencing discomfort through the duration of the study. Rash was observed in 
37 (82%) subjects a mean 3.5 days post onset of symptoms. Patents were positive 
by PCR for a mean of 5.9 days with sustained peak viral load through Day 5. The 
IgM antibodies appeared on Day 4 and peaked at Day 7 and IgG antibodies first 
appeared at Day 5 and rose steadily through Day 24.

The use of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been 
continuously increasing over the last decades. However, cuff-based devices may 
cause discomfort, particularly at night, leading to potentially 
non-representative blood pressure (BP) values. We investigated the feasibility 
of a cuff-less BP monitoring solution in 67 subjects undergoing conventional 
24-h ABPM. A watch-like optical sensor was attached at the upper arm or wrist at 
the contralateral side of the cuff. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) values 
were estimated from the measured optical signals by pulse wave analysis. Average 
24-h, daytime and nighttime BP values were compared between the conventional 
monitor and the cuff-less sensor. The differences between both methods-expressed 
as mean ± standard deviation (95% limits of agreement)-were of - 1.8 ± 6.2 mmHg 
(- 13.9, 10.3) on SBP and - 2.3 ± 5.4 mmHg (- 13.0, 8.3) on DBP for 24-h 
averages, of - 1.5 ± 6.6 mmHg (- 14.4, 11.4) on SBP and - 1.8 ± 5.9 mmHg 
(- 13.4, 9.9) on DBP for daytime averages, and of 0.4 ± 7.5 mmHg (- 14.4, 15.1) 
on SBP and - 1.3 ± 6.8 mmHg (- 14.7, 12.0) on DBP for nighttime averages. These 
results encouragingly suggest that cuff-less 24-h ABPM may soon become a 
clinical possibility.

Introduction: Robotic exoskeletons are emerging technologies that have 
demonstrated their effectiveness in assisting with Activities of Daily Living. 
However, kinematic disparities between human and robotic joints can result in 
misalignment between humans and exoskeletons, leading to discomfort and 
potential user injuries. Methods: In this paper, we present an ergonomic knee 
exoskeleton based on a dual four-bar linkage mechanism powered by hydraulic 
artificial muscles for stair ascent assistance. The device comprises two 
asymmetric four-bar linkage mechanisms on the medial and lateral sides to 
accommodate the internal rotation of the knee and address the kinematic 
discrepancies between these sides. A genetic algorithm was employed to optimize 
the parameters of the four-bar linkage mechanism to minimize misalignment 
between human and exoskeleton knee joints. The proposed device was evaluated 
through two experiments. The first experiment measured the reduction in 
undesired load due to misalignment, while the second experiment evaluated the 
device's effectiveness in assisting stair ascent in a healthy subject. Results: 
The experimental results indicate that the proposed device has a significantly 
reduced undesired load compared to the traditional revolute joint, decreasing 
from 14.15 N and 18.32 N to 1.88 N and 1.07 N on the medial and lateral sides, 
respectively. Moreover, a substantial reduction in muscle activities during 
stair ascent was observed, with a 55.94% reduction in surface electromyography 
signal. Discussion: The reduced undesired load of the proposed dual four-bar 
linkage mechanism highlights the importance of the adopted asymmetrical design 
for reduced misalignment and increased comfort. Moreover, the proposed device 
was effective at reducing the effort required during stair ascent.

BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is an endemic systemic infectious disease, the most 
common complication is bone and joint involvement. Sacroiliac joint infections 
and spinal joint infections commonly affect adults, but ankle infections are 
extremely rare. We report a case of recurrent ankle arthritis caused by Brucella 
melitensis (B. melitensis).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old Chinese male presented to a local hospital with 
right ankle pain and limited mobility 23 months ago and underwent a synovectomy 
of the ankle. Specimen culture revealed brucellosis infection in sheep. The 
patient came to the department of Orthopaedics of our hospital 18 months ago 
because his symptoms did not improve. The patient's blood culture of bacteria 
was negative, the serum Rose-Bengal Plate Agglutination Test was positive, and 
his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels 
were significantly elevated. Joint synovial fluid of right ankle was extracted 
by joint aspiration and sent to the laboratory for real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (Real-time-PCR) examination, the results showed that there was B. 
melitensis in the synovial fluid. We concluded that the patient had recurrent 
Brucella ankle arthritis and was treated with doxycycline (0.1 g po bid), 
rifampicin (0.6 g po qd) and cefotaxime-sulbactam (2.25 g ivgtt q8h) for six 
weeks during hospitalization. When the patient was discharged, the symptoms were 
mostly relieved and the inflammatory indicators returned to normal. At 
following-up 18 months later, the patient had no discomfort in the right ankle 
and all inflammatory markers were normal.
CONCLUSION: Brucella ankle arthritis is a rare but serious complication of adult 
brucellosis. Clinical manifestations and imaging examinations revealed no 
obvious specificity. In order to prevent ankle deformities, the dead bone of the 
ankle should be removed and the joint space cleaned and antibiotic therapy 
should be administered.

BACKGROUND: Synovial hemangioma of the knee is a rare benign tumor. Very rarely, 
the growth of bone is affected by long-term neglect of an intra-articular tumor. 
Our patient had not only various clinical symptoms but also dysplasia of the 
femoral bone. In this report, we aimed to raise awareness to prevent various 
disorders arising from an unnoticed or untreated hemangioma occurring within the 
knee joint.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 41-year-old Japanese man who had had 
occasional discomfort in the right knee since elementary school. Although he had 
undergone radiography at several hospitals since childhood, no issues were 
reported; subsequently, he consulted our hospital. We performed magnetic 
resonance imaging and discovered a mass. The mass was homogeneous with low 
intensity on T1-weighted sequences and high intensity on T2-weighted sequences 
adjacent to the medial femoral condyle. The shape of the medial femoral condyle 
presented with a concavity in axial images, with irregular margins from the 
patellofemoral joint to the medial femoral condyle. Moreover, by using magnetic 
resonance angiography, we discovered a second mass. We decided to perform open 
surgery to achieve complete excision. Histological examination indicated a 
synovial hemangioma involving a cavernous hemangioma and irregular arteriovenous 
connections originating from the subsynovial tissue. The patient became 
asymptomatic after surgery, with no recurrence for more than 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Synovial hemangioma is rare and difficult to diagnose in outpatient 
examinations because radiography has a limited diagnostic capacity. Magnetic 
resonance imaging and angiography are very useful. Nontreatment of 
intra-articular hemangiomas may lead to dysplasia of the bone and various 
clinical symptoms. Early complete excision may be instituted to reduce these 
risks of hemarthrosis.

BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a condition encompassing 
clinical symptoms of the temporomandibular joint, masseter muscle, and 
surrounding structures. Hominis placental pharmacopuncture (HPP), consisting of 
human placental extract, has been reported as effective for treating chronic 
musculoskeletal disorders, but a lack of well-designed randomised controlled 
trial s (RCTs) mean there is insufficient evidence to prove the efficacy of HPP.
METHODS: This study is a two-arm parallel, assessor-blinded, multi-centre, 
randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 82 chronic TMD patients from rwo 
Korean Medicine hospitals in Axis 1, Group I according to RDC/TMD diagnostic 
criteria, and randomly allocate 41 patients each to an HPP group and a physical 
therapy (PT) group. Treatment will be administered in 10 rounds, after which 
there will be four follow-up visits 6, 9, 13, and 25 weeks from baseline. The 
primary end point is 6 weeks after baseline, and the primary outcome is the 
difference in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for temporomandibular pain 
between baseline and week 6. Secondary outcomes will be Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS) scores for temporomandibular pain and discomfort, temporomandibular joint 
range of motion, the Korean version of Beck's Depression Index-II (K-BDI-II), 
Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS), Patient Global Impression of Change 
(PGIC) scores, and quality of life. Using data on adverse events and 
cost-effectiveness in the two groups, we will perform a safety assessment and a 
cost-effectiveness analysis (economic assessment).
DISCUSSION: This study will assess the efficacy and safety of HPP for chronic 
TMD compared with PT. This RCT will provide evidence for the efficacy, safety, 
and economics of HPP.

Individuals with patellofemoral pain (PFP) experience discomfort during various 
functional activities. Long-term pain is a common consequence of PFP, yet little 
is known about daily pain variability. Our study consisted of 25 individuals 
with PFP who completed the Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) and recorded their 
daily pain over 10 days. Pain was evaluated using 2 measures of intensity 
(baseline pain, 10-day average pain) and 2 measures of variability (mean square 
of successive differences, probability of acute change). Associations between 
AKPS and the 4 pain measures were calculated with Pearson correlations. We 
calculated a linear regression to examine the amount of variance in the AKPS 
explained by the 4 pain measures. Greater mean square of successive differences 
values were moderately associated with lesser AKPS scores (r = -0.648, P < 
.001). Mean square of successive differences and 10-day averaged pain were the 
strongest predictors of AKPS (R2 = 0.565, P < .001). Pain variability provided a 
unique perspective on the pain experience and predicted patient-oriented 
function in individuals with PFP.

RATIONALE: Hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) is an autosomal dominant disease 
that causes multiple exostoses throughout the body. It usually occurs around the 
metaphysis of the long bones, and when it involves the hip, symptoms arise due 
to deformity and the mass effect. If the lesion does not involve the joint or is 
not associated with arthritis, symptoms can be relieved by surgical excision of 
the osteochondroma. However, if secondary osteoarthritis (OA) or subluxation of 
the joint has progressed, joint replacement arthroplasty should be considered.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old woman with HME visited our outpatient department 
with severe right hip pain. She complained of difficulty walking and severe 
discomfort during activities of daily living. She was short in stature and had a 
family history of HME.
DIAGNOSIS: A physical examination revealed limited motion in the hip joint and a 
limb length discrepancy. Plain radiography and a computed tomography scan 
revealed huge osteochondromas on bilateral proximal femurs and advanced OA with 
subluxation of the right hip joint.
INTERVENTIONS: Cementless total hip arthroplasty of the right hip joint via the 
modified posterolateral approach was done.
OUTCOMES: The patient showed good clinical scores and functional improvement at 
the 2-year follow-up.
LESSONS: Total hip arthroplasty for an anatomically deformed joint is 
technically difficult, and there are many factors to consider that can make 
surgeons reluctant to use this modality. However, with careful preparation, 
arthroplasty is a good surgical option for symptomatic and functional recovery 
in HME patients with hip joint involvement.

INTRODUCTION: Osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) is considered to be one of the 
main causes for pain, discomfort and morbidity in the pediatric elbow joint. Few 
treatment options, such as microfracture or autologous transplantation, of 
osteochondral bone grafts have been described to address advanced OCD. The aim 
of this retrospective case series is to present preliminary clinical and 
radiologic findings following advanced stage OCD repair using a novel 
combination of a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold with autologous iliac crest bone 
grafting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five adolescents, who underwent treatment of OCD (grade 3 
or 4 according to Nelson) using a combination technique of defect debridement, 
transplantation of cancellous iliac crest bone and application of a HYALOFAST® 
membrane (Anika Therapeutics S.r.L., Italy), were re-assessed using clinical and 
radiologic examinations (defect diameter, depth, sclerosis, congruency, 
fragmentation, dissection, radiolucency, growth plate status; MRI) after a 
minimum of 2 years (mean, 34 months; range, 24-45) postoperatively. Dedicated 
outcome scores (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS], Pediatric Outcome Data Collection 
Instrument [PODCI], Mayo Elbow Performance Score [MEPS], and Timmerman-Andrews 
Score [TIMM] were collected.
RESULTS: All patients reported a NRS score of 0. The mean total TIMM, MEPS and 
PODCI (Global Functioning Scale) scores were 189 (range 165-200), 94 (range, 
70-100), and 92 (range 83-98; normative score 47; range 35-55), respectively, 
indicating good to excellent clinical outcomes. The radiographic analysis showed 
overall improvements with regard to OCD width and depth reduction 
(35%, - 27-100%; 52%, 4-100%), but full resolution in only 2 of 5 cases. Elbow 
motion improved slightly after surgery. No complications were noted.
CONCLUSION: This study showed promising clinical short- to mid-term results in 
adolescent patients with advanced OCD using a novel surgical treatment 
combination. Radiographic results showed partial healing; hence, residual 
changes should be monitored over a longer period.

INTRODUCTION: This work aimed to develop a novel multipurpose device for guided 
knee flexion-extension, both passively using a motorized pneumatic system and 
actively (muscle-driven) with the joint unloaded or loaded during dynamic MRI. 
Secondary objectives were to characterize the participant experience during 
device use, and present preliminary dynamic MRI data to demonstrate the 
different device capabilities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-reported outcomes were used to characterize the pain, 
physical exertion and discomfort levels experienced by 10 healthy male 
participants during four different active knee motion and loading protocols 
using the novel device. Knee angular data were recorded during the protocols to 
determine the maximum knee range of motion achievable. Dynamic MRI was acquired 
for three healthy volunteers during passive, unloaded knee motion using 2D 
Cartesian TSE, 2D radial GRE and 3D UTE sequences; and during active, unloaded 
and loaded knee motion using 2D radial GRE imaging. Because of the different MRI 
sequences used, spatial resolution was inherently lower for active knee motion 
than for passive motion acquisitions.
RESULTS: Depending on the protocol, some participants reported slight pain, mild 
discomfort and varying levels of physical exertion. On average, participants 
achieved ∼40° of knee flexion; loaded conditions can create knee moments up to 
27Nm. High quality imaging data were obtained during different motion and 
loading conditions. Dynamic 3D data allowed to retrospectively extract 
arbitrarily oriented slices.
CONCLUSION: A novel multipurpose device for guided, physiologically relevant 
knee motion and loading during dynamic MRI was developed. Device use was well 
tolerated and suitable for acquiring high quality images during different motion 
and loading conditions. Different bone positions between loaded and unloaded 
conditions were likely due to out-of-plane motion, particularly because image 
registration was not performed. Ultimately, this device could be used to advance 
our understanding of physiological and pathological joint mechanics.

A 12-year-old girl presented with a history of cervical mass, and one week of 
throat discomfort and dyspnea. Five years ago, the patient was diagnosed as 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism; she received antithyroid drug 
treatment, but the result was not satisfactory. B-ultrasonic showed that the 
size of thyroid gland was 8.1 cm×3.2 cm in the left and 8.2 cm×4.8 cm in the 
right. After iodine 131 combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, 
throat discomfort and recumbent breathing difficulties disappeared, and 
B-ultrasonic showed that the size of thyroid reduced to 2.3 cm×1.7 cm (left) and 
2.8 cm×2.0 cm (right). No recurrence was observed during the two and a half 
years of follow-up.

Neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder is a rare disorder characterized by 
joint degeneration, and is associated with loss of sensory innervation. 
Syringomyelia is a disease in which fluid-containing cavities (syrinxes) form 
within the spinal cord. Here, we report a case of neuropathic arthropathy of the 
shoulder secondary to syringomyelia in a 40-year-old woman. X-rays of the left 
shoulder revealed damage to bone and joint architecture. Blood tests indicated 
vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Magnetic resonance 
imaging of the cervical spine showed a large syrinx from the second cervical 
spine to the second dorsal spine. Although neuropathic arthropathy is uncommon, 
it should be considered in cases of unexplained pain, discomfort, or limited 
range of motion of the affected joint. Symptoms related to the affected joint 
may precede or overshadow neurological deficits. Appropriate radiological 
examinations and diagnoses are imperative to prevent misdiagnosis or undetected 
bone and joint disorders.

Pain is recognized as one of the main symptoms in knee osteoarthritis and is the 
main reason why patients seek medical attention. Scoparia dulcis has been 
popularly used to relieve discomfort caused by various painful conditions. The 
objective of the study is to evaluate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect 
of the crude extract of S. dulcis, in an experimental model of osteoarthritis. 
The experiment was performed with Wistar rats divided into 4 groups with 5 
animals each: healthy, saline, crude extract, and meloxicam groups. Knee 
osteoarthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of sodium 
mono-iodoacetate. First, clinical parameters of pain were assessed at days 0, 5, 
10, 15, and 20 after induction. Second, the potential cyclooxygenase inhibition 
was evaluated, and the cytokines of the synovial fluid were quantified. An in 
silico test and Molecular Docking tests were performed. A histopathological 
evaluation was made on articular cartilage with safranin O staining. The results 
showed that a 15-day treatment with crude extract reduced edema, spontaneous 
pain, peripheral nociceptive activity, and proinflammatory cytokines in the 
synovial fluid. The highest inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 in the crude extract 
occurred at 50 µg/mL. The crude extract of S. dulcis presents therapeutic 
potential for the treatment of osteoarthritis due to its anti-inflammatory and 
anti-nociceptive action.

OBJECTIVES: In 2010-2011, a large waterborne outbreak of Cryptosporidium hominis 
affected the city of Östersund in Sweden. Previous findings had suggested that 
gastrointestinal symptoms can persist for up to 11 months after the initial 
infection. Here we investigated whether the parasite could cause sequelae in 
infected individuals up to 28 months after the outbreak. We compared cases 
linked to the outbreak and the previous follow-up study with non-cases regarding 
symptoms present up to 28 months after the initial infection. We investigated 
whether cases were more likely to report a list of symptoms at follow-up 
compared to non-cases, calculating odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 
obtained through logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 559 individuals (215 cases) were included in the study. 
Forty-eight percent of the outbreak cases reported symptoms at follow-up. 
Compared to non-cases, cases were more likely to report watery diarrhea, 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, headache, or joint 
stiffness/pain/discomfort at follow-up after adjusting for age and sex. Our 
findings suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms and joint pain can persist 
several years after the initial Cryptosporidium infection and should be regarded 
as a potential cause of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms or joint pain in 
people who have had this infection.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Chronic terminal extensor tendon injury produces 
mallet deformity and secondary swan neck deformity. It can be found in neglect 
cases and in a failed cases after conservative treatment or primary surgical 
repair. Surgery is considered in cases with extensor lag of more than 30° and 
functional deficit. Reconstruction of the spiral oblique retinacular ligament 
(SORL) has been reported in literatures to correct swan neck deformity by a 
dynamic mechanical basis.
CASE PRESENTATION: Three cases of chronic mallet finger associated with swan 
neck deformity were treated by the modified technique of SORL reconstruction. 
Range of motion (ROM) of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and proximal 
interphalangeal (PIP) joints were measured along with the complications. The 
clinical outcome was reported using the Crawford's criteria.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: All patients had an average age of 34 years (20-54). 
Average time to surgery was 16.67 months (2-24) and average of DIP extension lag 
was 66.67°. All patient gave excellent Crawford criteria at the latest follow up 
(average 15.3 months). The average PIP joint ROM were -1.60 (00 to -50) of 
extension and 1100 (1000-1200) of flexion for the PIP joint and -1.60 (00 to 
-50) of extension and 83.330 (800-850) of flexion for the DIP joint.
CONCLUSION: We present our technique to manage chronic mallet injury which only 
utilized two skin incisions and one button at the distal phalanx to minimize 
risk of skin necrosis and patient discomfort. This procedure can be considered 
as one of the options for the treatment of chronic mallet finger deformity 
associated with swan neck deformity.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and clinical 
outcomes of microendoscopic dorsal laminectomy for multi-level cervical 
intervertebral disc protrusions in dogs. Eight client-owned dogs diagnosed with 
multi-level cervical intervertebral disc protrusions using computed tomography 
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this retrospective 
case series. Microendoscopic dorsal laminectomies (MEL) were performed with an 
integrated endoscopic system to the cranial and caudal vertebrae of the affected 
intervertebral joints. Pre- and post-operative neurological status, operation 
time, intra-operative complications, and postoperative complications were 
reviewed. Post-operative CT images were obtained to measure the dimensions of 
laminectomy and compared to those of planned laminectomy. Full endoscopic 
procedures were feasible in 7 dogs (87.5%) and the laminectomy dimensions were 
in agreement with pre-operative planning. In all dogs, major intra- and 
postoperative complications did not occur. Conversion to open surgery was 
required in one case. Short-term postoperative clinical deterioration was found 
in two dogs. Long-term clinical outcomes were good and comparable to those 
reported in previous studies of open dorsal laminectomies. MEL is a promising 
minimally invasive approach to multi-level cervical dorsal laminectomy for 
intervertebral disc protrusions. This technique may improve postoperative 
discomfort compared to the open approach. Further studies are needed to directly 
compare outcomes between these two approaches.

PURPOSE: Purpose of the study was to report the outcomes after radial head 
excision in children and adolescents in addition with a review of the current 
literature.
METHODS: We report a series of five children and adolescents, who had undergone 
a post-traumatic radial head excision. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms 
of elbow/wrist range of motion, stability, deformity and discomforts or 
restrictions at two follow-up points. Radiographic changes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Patient's age at time of the radial head excision averaged 14.6 
(13-16) years. Mean time from the injury to the radial head excision was 3.6 
(0-9) years. Follow-up I averaged 4.4 (1-8) years and follow-up II 8.5 
(7-10) years. At follow-up I, patients showed an average elbow range of motion 
of 0-10-120° Ext/Flex and 90-0-80° Pro/Sup. Two patients reported discomfort or 
pain at the elbow. Four (80%) patients had a symptomatic wrist with pain or 
crepitation at the distal radio ulnar joint. In three (60%) of them, an ulna 
plus at the wrist was present. Two patients required ulna shortening and 
autograft stabilization of the interosseous membrane. At final follow-up, all 
patients reported full functioning with daily activities. Restrictions were 
present with sport activities.
CONCLUSION: Functional results at the elbow joint might be improved and pain 
syndromes lessen due to the radial head excision. Problems at the wrist are 
likely secondary to the procedure. A critical analysis of other options should 
be performed ahead of the procedure and a careless application should be avoided 
by all means.

AIMS: To investigate the prevalence, pain catastrophizing and other predictive 
factors and clinical course of persistent pain/discomfort associated with teeth 
displaying periapical healing following nonsurgical root canal treatment 
(NSRCT).
METHODOLOGY: One hundred and ninety-eight patients (264 teeth) who had NSRCT 
were reviewed at 5-14 months, postoperatively. Teeth with persistent 
post-treatment pain or discomfort, plus evidence of periapical healing were 
further monitored 0.5, 4 and 10 years later. Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) 
and Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) were completed. 
Predictive factors were investigated using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Twenty-four per cent (60/249) of teeth displaying periapical healing at 
first review were associated with persistent pain or discomfort. Fifty-five 
teeth monitored 6-7 months later were associated with reduction in pain (17/30) 
or discomfort (7/25). Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of eight teeth with 
persistent symptoms and complete periapical healing (by conventional 
radiographs) revealed distinct, small apical radiolucencies (n = 3) or root apex 
fenestration through the buccal plate (n = 2). History of chronic pain 
(headache, temporo-mandibular joint, masticatory muscle, neck, shoulder or back 
pain; P = 0.005), preoperative pain (P = 0.04), responsive pulp (P = 0.009), 
tooth crack (P = 0.05) and small periapical radiolucency (P = 0.005) were 
significant predictive factors. The PCS revealed 16 patients (22 teeth) were 
catastrophizers (PCS ≥ 30), but this had no influence on post-treatment symptoms 
(P = 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent pain or discomfort associated with teeth showing 
periapical healing at the first review after NSRCT, decreased in intensity in 
most cases over the following 6 months. Longer-term follow-up revealed 
spontaneous improvement or symptom resolution in the majority of those with 
confirmed radiographic the absence of periapical disease. Five predictive 
factors (history of chronic pain, teeth with responsive pulps, association with 
pain, diagnosis of tooth crack before treatment and diameter of preoperative 
radiolucency) were identified.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early effectiveness of a new minimally invasive plate 
in the treatment of varus-type ankle arthritis.
METHODS: A clinical data of 15 patients with varus-type ankle arthritis who met 
the selection criteria between March 2021 and October 2021 were retrospectively 
analyzed. All the patients were treated with medial open-wedge supramalleolar 
osteotomy and fibular osteotomy. The osteotomies were fixed with the new 
minimally invasive plate. There were 7 males and 8 females with an average age 
of 49.8 years (range, 16-71 years). The causes of ankle arthritis included 
post-fracture deformity in 1 case, sprain in 8 cases, and acquired clubfoot in 1 
case; and 5 cases were without obvious factors. The disease duration ranged from 
1 to 12 years, with an average of 4.1 years. Comparisons were made between 
pre-operation and the last follow-up in the Takakura staging, the American 
Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, foot function 
index (FFI), visual analogue scale (VAS) score, tibial anterior surface angle 
(TAS), tibial lateral surface angle (TLS), and talar tilt (TT).
RESULTS: All incisions healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 
7-18 months (mean, 12.8 months). At last follow-up, the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot 
score, FFI, VAS score, and Takakura staging significantly improved when compared 
with the preoperative ones ( P<0.05). X-ray films showed that the osteotomy 
healed at 3 months after operation. At last follow-up, TAS significantly 
increased and TT decreased when compared with the preoperative ones ( P<0.05), 
and the difference in TLS between pre- and post-operation was not significant ( 
P>0.05). Complications included 1 case of intraoperative screw breakage and 2 
cases of nerve injury of the affected foot. None of the patients complained of 
significant discomfort at the plate placement during follow-up, and no loosening 
of the internal fixator occurred. Eleven patients were very satisfied with the 
effeectiveness, while 4 were relatively satisfied.
CONCLUSION: The new minimally invasive plate for the varus-type ankle arthritis 
has good early effectiveness in relieving ankle pain, correcting deformity, 
improving limb alignment and ankle function, and reducing the incidence of 
postoperative incisional complications.

Preservation of anatomical components in rhinoplasty has gained increasing 
popularity over recent years. Given that elevation of the soft tissue envelope 
in a continuous subperiochondrial-subperiosteal dissection preserves soft 
tissues, vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, this procedure may result in faster 
healing time and less swelling and scarring. However, the technique requires a 
learning phase and can be challenging to perform because it typically requires 
meticulous dissection under surgical loupes. The dissection may thus be 
time-consuming and a burden for surgeons, especially in secondary rhinoplasty 
cases. Further, the potential risk of musculoskeletal discomfort and injury to 
the surgeon should not be overlooked; consideration for surgical ergonomics is 
needed to prevent injuries and enhance surgical performance. To address these 
issues, we propose the use of a surgical microscope for 
subperiochondrial-subperiosteal dissection in preservation rhinoplasty. A 
microscope enables clear visualization of the surgical field and allows surgeons 
to make precise and delicate manipulation maneuvers. Moreover, it may also 
enable surgeons to maintain an ideal ergonomic posture and neutral positioning 
of their joints, thereby reducing physical strain. A surgical microscope may 
thus be a useful tool for subperiochondrial-subperiosteal dissection by 
providing clear visualization of the surgical field and improved surgical 
ergonomics for surgeons.

Hip replacement surgery has gone through tremendous evolution since the first 
procedure in 1840. In the past five decades the advances that have been made in 
technology, advanced and smart materials innovations, surgical techniques, 
robotic surgery and methods of fixations and sterilization, facilitated hip 
implants that undergo multiple design revolutions seeking the least problematic 
implants and a longer survivorship. Hip surgery has become a solution for many 
in need of hip joint remedy and replacement across the globe. Nevertheless, 
there are still long-term problems that are essential to search and resolve to 
find the optimum implant. This paper reviews several recent patents on hip 
replacement surgery. The patents present various designs of prostheses, 
different materials as well as methods of fixation. Each of the patents presents 
a new design as a solution to different issues ranging from the longevity of the 
hip prostheses to discomfort and inconvenience experienced by patients in the 
long-term.

INTRODUCTION: Primary subacute pyogenic osteomyelitis, or Brodie's abscess was 
initially documented by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1832. We present a case report 
with a 6-months follow-up period, demonstrating the successful diagnosis and 
surgical treatment of a focal lesion of the proximal metaphysis of the right 
humerus in a 21-years-old female. The pathology of hematologic osteomyelitis and 
its role in the development of a subacute abscess along with a review of 
literature and an in detail description of the pathogenesis of Brodie's abscess 
is discussed and submitted.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 21- years -old healthy female with a history of fall 
sustaining injury to the right shoulder one 1 year back followed by which she 
presented to the outpatient clinic with a swelling over her right shoulder. The 
patient was managed conservatively with analgesics and was relieved of pain over 
a course of one 1 week of medications, the patient now presents with pain and 
swelling in the right shoulder joint on and off since the episode of fall one 1 
year back, which had increased over a period of past one 1 week. A week before 
the most recent presentation she started experiencing some discomfort and pain 
in her right shoulder. No recent trauma was reported. A mild swelling appeared 
over the proximal part of the humerus. There were no constitutional symptoms of 
fever or any illness reported. On examination, there was noted a painful 
restriction of ROM at the right shoulder joint with no rotator cuff injury. 
Laboratory investigations were suggestive of raised inflammatory markers. 
Radiograph of the right shoulder taken in the true antero-posterior view with 
the shoulder in the neutral rotation was suggestive of an oval lucency with 
surrounding sclerosis in the proximal metaphyseal region of the humerus. 
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the right shoulder joint showed features 
consistent with Brodie's abscess in the proximal metaphyseal region of the 
humerus. Surgical debridement of the abscess was planned. The right shoulder of 
the patient was immobilized by a universal shoulder immobilizer for 3 days post 
-operatively and then Pphysiotherapy for shoulder range of movements was 
started. Infectious parameters decreased and there were no complications in the 
postoperative period. Regular follow follow-up for two 2 weeks showed clinical 
improvement. At 6 months follow- up, the patient had made full recovery with 
radiographic improvement.
CONCLUSION: Brodie's abscess was first described by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1832. 
Primary hematogenous subacute osteomyelitis is rarely seen in the proximal 
metaphysis of the humerus. With appropriate surgical debridement and aggressive 
antibiotic cover, a near 100% success rate is observed in the treatment of 
Brodie's abscess with no residual deformities in the affected bones or 
restrictions in the range of movements in the neighboring joints.

The ankle joint is a complex joint that bears the human body's weight throughout 
daily activities. Unimalleolar, bimalleolar, and trimalleolar fractures are the 
three subgroups that make up the category of ankle fractures. Determining the 
risk-benefit tradeoffs between non-operative and surgical therapy still requires 
a thorough initial examination of the fracture pattern, soft tissue condition, 
and patient characteristics. Ankle fractures that are stable and well-aligned 
respond well to conservative therapy. Open reduction and internal fixation is 
the current gold standard of treatment for displaced and unstable fracture 
patterns, with historical data revealing good to outstanding outcomes for the 
majority of these patients. We present a case of a 19-year-old female sustaining 
a Pott's fracture following a road traffic accident. The overall treatment 
technique used included the overload principle, task-specific training, and an 
impairment-based strategy. The patient's impairments with regard to the range of 
motion, strength, edema, discomfort, wound healing, and functional limitations 
were handled by the therapist using exercises, manual therapy, and compressive 
cryotherapy. A clinically significant rehabilitation protocol for treating 
Pott's fracture is established in this case report.

The implantation of joint prostheses, especially for the hip and knee, is 
becoming increasingly common. This provides a significant reduction in 
discomfort and an immeasurable improvement in patient mobility. Reviews of the 
worldwide literature indicate that 1 to 5% of these prostheses become infected, 
although it is important to remember that as the number of operations performed 
to implant these prosthesis increases, so will the number of cases of this type 
of infection. Gram-positive bacteria predominate in contaminations of joint 
prostheses, in particular Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. 
Infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and fungi such as Candida sp have 
been reported with increased frequency throughout the world. Infections of joint 
prostheses present characteristic signs that can be divided into acute 
manifestations (severe pain, high fever, toxemia, heat, redness and wound 
secretions) and chronic manifestations (progressive pain, cutaneous fistula 
formation and pus drainage, without fever). The definitive diagnosis of the 
infection should be made through cultures to isolate the microorganism, using 
material collected from joint fluid puncture, surgical wound secretions, and 
surgical debridement. It is essential to cover for methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, given the epidemiological importance of this agent in 
these infections. The total duration of antibiotic therapy ranges from six weeks 
to six months, and this treatment should be adjusted as needed, based on the 
results from culturing.

Background and Objectives: This study investigated the effects of prolonged 
sitting on trunk muscular fatigue and discomfort in participants with and 
without chronic lower back pain (LBP). Material and Methods: This study included 
15 patients with LBP and 15 healthy controls. All participants were instructed 
to sit on a height-adjustable chair with their knee and hip joints bent at 90° 
for 30 min, in slumped sitting postures. Surface electromyography was used to 
assess the median frequency of the internal obliques (IO)/transversus abdominis 
(TrA) and multifidus (MF) muscles. Perceived discomfort was measured using a 
Borg category ratio-scale. Median frequency of the trunk muscles and perceived 
discomfort after 30 min of sitting were compared with baseline. Result: There 
were no significant differences within the group and between both groups in the 
median frequency of bilateral IO and MF muscles. The LBP group showed 
significantly greater perceived discomfort after prolonged sitting, as compared 
to the control group. Conclusions: Prolonged sitting with slumped posture could 
increase the risk of experiencing lower back discomfort.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the depth and distribution of sensory discomfort 
in idiopathic restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS) and RLS 
concurrent with other leg conditions, specifically peripheral neuropathy, 
sciatica, leg cramps, and arthritis.
METHODS: RLS subjects (n = 122) were divided into 71 idiopathic RLS and 51 
RLS-C, or Comorbid, groups. All subjects were examined by an RLS expert, 
answered standardized RLS questionnaires, and received a body diagram to draw 
the location and depth of their symptoms.
RESULTS: Age was 63.04 ± 12.84 years, with 77 females and 45 males. All patients 
had lower limb involvement and 43/122 (35.25%) also had upper limb involvement. 
Of the 122 subjects, 42.62% felt that the RLS discomfort was only deep, 9.84% 
felt that the discomfort was only superficial, and 47.54% felt both superficial 
and deep discomfort. There were no defining characteristics in depth or 
distribution of RLS sensations that differentiated those patients with 
idiopathic RLS from those patients with RLS associated with other comorbid leg 
conditions. The sensation of arthritis was felt almost exclusively in the joints 
and not in the four quadrants of the leg, whereas the exact opposite was true of 
RLS sensations.
CONCLUSIONS: Depth and distribution cannot be used as a discriminative mechanism 
to separate out idiopathic RLS from RLS comorbid with other leg conditions. 
Although seen in clinical practice, the total absence of patients with 
non-painful RLS only in the joints in the current study attests to the rarity of 
this presentation and raises the possibility of misdiagnosis under these 
circumstances. We recommend that such patients not be admitted to genetic or 
epidemiological studies.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported that in partial knee arthroplasty smooth 
transitions to the remaining native parts of the knee are important. However, in 
mobile-bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) it is mandatory to create an 
anterior osteochondral notch adjacent to the femoral component to get clearance 
for the anterior lip of the bearing in full knee extension. This notch is, 
however, part of the femoral trochlea. It was the aim of the study to test for a 
potential association between a) an obligatory anterior notch in mobile-bearing 
UKA located at the margin of the medial aspect of the femoral trochlea and b) 
postoperative patellofemoral joint (PFJ) bone remodelling and discomfort.
METHODS: In patients who underwent routine mobile-bearing UKA (11 male, 13 
female; 64.5 years / IQR 14) the following parameters were prospectively 
determined i) size of the surgically created anterior notch, ii) knee score 
sensitive to PFJ disorders, iii) bone remodelling in the PFJ (radiotracer uptake 
in SPECT-CT).
RESULTS: Notch size was not correlated with radiotracer uptake at the PFJ. 
Similarly, no significant correlations were observed between radiotracer uptake 
(patella or trochleocondylar junction) and knee scores (KOOS or Kujala Score). 
Significant positive correlations were found between notch size and knee scores.
CONCLUSIONS: From the findings made in our study it is concluded that a larger 
size of the anterior notch in mobile-bearing medial Oxford UKA is not associated 
with increased osteochondral remodelling processes at the patella or the 
trochleocondylar junction. Neither is a larger sized notch associated with worse 
clinical PFJ outcome. Surprisingly, a larger notch was even associated with 
superior clinical outcome. The exact mechanism for this contraintuitive finding 
remains unclear but may be the basis for future research.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of a 10-week gait modification program in 
people with medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (OA), and to assess changes 
in clinical and biomechanical outcomes.
DESIGN: Fifteen people with medial knee OA completed 10 weeks of gait 
modification focusing on increasing toe-out angle during stance 10° compared to 
their self-selected angle measured at baseline. In addition to adherence and 
performance difficulty outcomes, knee joint symptoms (Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale and total 
score, numerical rating scale (NRS) of pain), and knee joint loading during gait 
(late stance peak knee adduction moment (KAM)) were assessed.
RESULTS: Participants were able to perform the toe-out gait modification program 
with minimal to moderate difficulty, and exhibited significant increases in 
self-selected toe-out angle during walking (P < 0.001). Joint discomfort was 
reported by five participants (33%) in the hip or knee joints, though none 
lasted longer than 2 weeks. Participants reported statistically significant 
reductions in WOMAC pain (P = 0.02), NRS pain (P < 0.001), WOMAC total score (P 
= 0.02), and late stance KAM (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that toe-out gait modification 
is feasible in people with medial compartment knee OA. Preliminary changes in 
clinical and biomechanical outcomes provide the impetus for conducting larger 
scale studies of gait modification in people with knee OA to confirm these 
findings.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether increased lateral trunk lean toward the 
symptomatic lower extremity during gait in people with medial knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) immediately alters symptoms or medial knee load, as measured 
by the external knee adduction moment (KAM).
METHODS: Participants with medial knee OA (n = 22) underwent 3-dimensional gait 
analysis to measure KAM peaks (early and late stance) and KAM impulse. Following 
the analysis of natural gait, participants were trained to lean their trunk 
toward the symptomatic leg during ipsilateral stance over 3 randomly ordered 
conditions (6°, 9°, and 12° lean). A projection screen displayed real-time trunk 
angles and target levels. Pain/discomfort in the knees, the hip, and the back 
were measured across conditions. Load-modifying effects of increasing lean 
magnitudes were investigated using linear mixed models. Mediating effects of 
peak lean timing and participant characteristics (pain and malalignment) were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Increased trunk lean reduced all KAM measures (P < 0.001), with larger 
lean angles achieving greater reductions. Efficacy of load reduction improved 
with later peak lean timing for all measures of the KAM. Participant 
characteristics did not mediate the effect of trunk lean on the KAM, and 
symptoms did not change across conditions (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Increased trunk lean reduced medial knee load in a dose-response 
manner. Slightly later achievement of peak trunk lean improved the 
load-modifying effect of this gait strategy. No immediate symptomatic changes 
were identified. Future research should determine if long-term implementation of 
this gait strategy is feasible and whether it can modify disease symptoms and OA 
progression.

BACKGROUND: According to the International Association for the Study of Pain 
(IASP), the term temporomandibular disorder (TMD) regards a subgroup of 
orofacial pain, the symptoms of which include pain or discomfort in the 
temporomandibular joint, ears, masticatory muscles and neck on one or both 
sides, as well as joint sounds, limited mandibular movements or mandibular 
deviation and difficulties chewing. Phototherapy, such as low-level laser 
therapy (LLLT) and light-emitting diode (LED) therapy, is one of the resources 
used to treatment muscle pain. Thus, there is a need to investigate therapeutic 
resources that combine different wavelengths as well as different light sources 
(LLLT and LED) in the same apparatus. The aim of the proposed study is to 
evaluate the effects of four different doses of phototherapy on pain, activity 
of the masticatory muscles (masseter and bilateral anterior temporal) and joint 
mobility in individuals with temporomandibular disorder. A further aim is to 
determine the cumulative effect 24 and 48 hours after a single session.
METHODS/DESIGN: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial 
will be carried out involving 72 women between 18 and 40 years of age with a 
diagnosis of myogenous TMD. The participants will then be randomly allocated to 
four groups totaling 18 individuals per group. Three groups will be submitted to 
a single session of phototherapy with different light sources, and one group 
will receive placebo therapy: Group A (2.62 Joules); Group B (5.24 Joules); 
Group C (7.86 Joules); and Group D (0 Joules). The following assessment tools 
will be administered on four separate occasions (baseline and immediately after, 
24 h after and 48 h after phototherapy). Pain intensity will be assessed using 
the visual analog scale for pain, while pain thresholds will be determined using 
algometer, and electromyographic (EMG) analysis on the masseter and anterior 
temporal muscles.
DISCUSSION: The study will contribute to the practice of the evidence-based use 
of phototherapy in individuals with a myogenous TMD. Data will be published 
after the study is completed.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with the Brazilian Registry of 
Clinical Trials, NCT02018770, date of registration: 7 December 2013.

Conventional radial access has become the default access for coronary 
angiography. Sometime, it is difficult to take a conventional radial access, 
especially in patients having severe arthropathies leading to limited wrist 
joint mobility. In such scenarios, distal transradial access (dTRA) can be 
adopted. We describe a case of an elderly male patient having rheumatoid 
arthritis with arthropathies. He presented to us with unstable angina; coronary 
angiogram was advised for ischaemia assessment. Right dTRA was adopted due to 
severe joint deformity at wrist joint, limiting joint extension. A successful 
coronary angiogram was performed via the right dTRA without major discomfort and 
complications. Haemostasis was secured with TR band radial artery compression 
device. In this case report, we have evaluated the importance of practising dTRA 
in a patient with severe arthropathies.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common age-related debilitating disease of the joints 
characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage which leads to joint 
pain, discomfort, and immobility. Several risk factors have been associated with 
OA including a genetic predisposition. Specific chromosomal regions have thus 
far been associated with susceptibility to OA, the strongest being on 
chromosomes 2, 6, and 16. We hereby report our data on 34 Central Greek knee OA 
families that were investigated for linkage to the chromosome 6q and 16p 
susceptibility regions. All affected members had undergone total knee 
replacement surgery (TKR) at a single large Orthopedics Unit in Central Greece. 
Nineteen microsatellite markers were selected, 15 for chromosome 6q and 4 for 
chromosome 16p at a distance of approximately 7 cm. Allele fragment sizes were 
determined by an automated DNA sequencer using the Fragment Analysis Software. 
Our results revealed a statistically significant difference in the ratio of 
affected females to males with knee OA and also showed that there is no evidence 
of linkage to regions 6q and 16p in a cohort of Central Greek pedigrees with 
knee OA.

BACKGROUND: In Mason classification type II radial head fractures, compared to 
plate fixation, fixation with cannulated headless screws and absorbable pins has 
been reported to provide more favorable postoperative outcomes, including less 
postoperative limitation in range of motion. The fact that radial head fractures 
are less prone to weight-bearing during fracture union further supports the use 
of absorbable screws as a suitable alternative treatment option in radial head 
fractures. This study aimed to perform fixation through open reduction using 
bioabsorbable magnesium screws for Mason type II radial head fractures and to 
report radiographic and clinical results.
METHODS: Among patients who visited the orthopedic department from April 2017 to 
August 2021, 22 with surgical indications were selected for participation. 
Radiographic tests were conducted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 
months, and over 1 year after surgery to confirm the degree of bone union, 
reduction loss, and degree of H2 gas production. The Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), hand grip 
power, and range of joint motion were measured at the 6-month follow-up to 
evaluate the clinical efficacy of the operation.
RESULTS: Bone union was confirmed in all 22 cases, and the mean time to union 
was 10.2 weeks. DASH score was 22.27 on average and no patients complained of 
significant discomfort after the surgery. The mean MEPS was 91.1. The hand grip 
power of the affected hand was similar to that of the unaffected hand, being 
1.19% weaker on average. These differences reached statistical significance (p = 
0.002). The range of elbow joint motion was measured: mean flexion, 146.1°; mean 
extension, 1.4°; mean pronation, 88.2°; and mean supination, 87.9°.
CONCLUSIONS: In treating Mason type II radial head fractures, the use of 
bioabsorbable screws made of magnesium showed satisfactory results in 
radiographic and clinical evaluations. Magnesium bioabsorbable screws can 
maintain sufficient stability at the fracture site and have the advantage of 
avoiding secondary operation for the removal of internal fixation devices.

Long-term stability of mandibular orthopedic repositioning.

Comment in
    Angle Orthod. 1999 Jun;69(3):195.

Mandibular anterior repositioning appliances attempt to diminish 
temporomandibular joint pain, soft tissue noise, and myofascial discomfort by 
altering condyle-disc relationships. Secondary stabilization of the occlusion to 
this arbitrary anterior position through orthodontic tooth movement may 
significantly alter functional and muscular relationships. A case report is 
illustrated to show that as the functional environment attempted to reestablish 
equilibrium through adaptation, relapse occurred as the condyles "seated" 
posteriorly and superiorly toward their original relationship within the fossa. 
For all practical purposes, complete relapse of the orthodontic treatment result 
took place over time.

BACKGROUND: Long term effectiveness of surgical management of chronically 
restricted mouth opening in OSMF or TMJ ankylosis depends largely on 
postoperative physiotherapy. This in turn is dependent on patient's compliance. 
Use of adjunctive aids besides pharmacotherapy that reduces patients pain and 
improves compliance with exercise is warranted.
AIMS: To evaluate the role of TENS and structured rehabilitation programme in 
postoperative physiotherapy in OSMF and TMJ ankylosis patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A pilot study was conducted in which 6 patients of 
restricted mouth opening were put on a structured rehabilitation protocol in 
which TENS, heat and cold therapy with structured mouth opening exercise 
regimes. Interincisal opening, VAS score and a subjective assessment of post 
surgical discomfort was evaluated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed an improved compliance and cooperation 
by patients. Pain on VAS scale also reduced from mean of 7.8 on day 1 to 3.6 on 
day 5 in this group. The mean discomfort on day 3 was reported as mild to 
moderate. An early attainment of passive mouth opening closest to intraoperative 
mouth opening was also reported on day 5 which is usually not achievable without 
any physiotherapy intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of lateral ligament reconstruction with 
autogenous partial peroneus longus tendon for chronic lateral ankle instability.
METHODS: Between September 2014 and November 2018, 32 patients (32 sides) with 
chronic lateral ankle instability were treated with lateral ankle ligament 
reconstruction by using autogenous anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon. 
There were 25 males and 7 females, with an average age of 28.5 years (range, 
20-51 years). The disease duration was 6-41 months (mean, 8.9 months). The 
preoperative Karlsson-Peterson ankle score was 53.7±9.7. The talar tilt angle 
was (14.9±3.7)°, and the anterior talar translation was (8.2±2.8) mm. Six 
patients combined with osteochondral lesion of talus and 4 patients combined 
with bony impingement.
RESULTS: All incisions healed by first intention postoperatively. All patients 
were followed up 12-53 months (mean, 22.7 months). At last follow-up, the 
Karlsson-Peterson ankle score was 85.2±9.6; the talar tilt angle was (4.3±1.4)°; 
the anterior talar translation was (3.5±1.1) mm. There were significant 
differences in all indexes between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). Seventeen 
patients were very satisfied with the results, 10 patients were satisfied, 4 
patients were normal, and 1 patient was unsatisfied. After operation, the ankle 
sprain occurred in 7 cases, the tenderness around the compression screws at 
calcaneus in 5 cases, the anterolateral pain of ankle joint over 6 months in 4 
cases. No patient had discomfort around the reciepient sites. At last follow-up, 
the ultrasonography examination showed that there was no significant difference 
in the density and diameter between bilateral peroneus longus tendons in 12 
cases.
CONCLUSION: For chronic lateral ankle instability, the lateral ankle ligament 
reconstruction with the autogenous partial peroneus longus tendon is a safe and 
effective surgical option.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) in dogs is a prevalent and serious condition. 
The most common treatment for the clinical signs of OA in dogs is the 
administration of nonsteroidal antiiflammatory pharmaceuticals. Omega-3 (n-3) 
fatty acids have been shown to reduce the clinical signs of osteoarthritis in 
dogs.
OBJECTIVE: The primary goals of this study were 1) to determine the effects of 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the clinical signs 
of OA in dogs, 2) to evaluate the effects of supplementation on the arachadonic 
acid (ARA)/ (EPA+DHA) algorithm and 3) to correlate alterations in the 
ARA/(EPA+DHA) with changes in the clinical signs of canine OA.
METHODS: Seventy-eight client owned dogs were enrolled in a prospective, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. Dogs were 
randomized to placebo oil or triglyceride n-3 oil (providing an average dose of 
69mg EPA+DHA/kg/day). Orthopedic examinations and blood analyses were performed 
at baseline, day 42, and day 84. A single investigator confirmed a diagnosis of 
OA of the coxofemoral joints and/or stifle joints in all dogs.
RESULTS: Seventy-four dogs completed the trial. All clinical outcomes for 
measuring discomfort, lameness, and joint severity at day 84 and all blood 
metrics at day 42 and day 84 significantly (p<0.05) improved compared with 
placebo. No major side effects were observed.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated that the daily 
supplementation of a dogs diet with EPA and DHA shifts the blood fatty acid 
concentrations correlating to relief of clinical signs associated with OA in 
dogs.

Acromioclavicular dislocations; open reduction with screw fixation.

MEIER AW, GRANNIS WR, TANNER JB.

Athletes with complete separation of the acromioclavicular joint were uniformly 
restored to full athletic competence by an operation consisting of direct repair 
of the involved ligamentous structures with temporary fixation by a metallic lag 
screw approximating the clavicle to the coracoid. The metallic fixation was left 
in place an average of eight weeks and the screw was then removed under local 
anesthesia. A number of professional and collegiate football players returned to 
the rigors of football with no discomfort or disability.

Tendons and ligaments play key roles in the musculoskeletal system in both man 
and animals. Both tissues can undergo traumatic injury, age-related degeneration 
and chronic disease, causing discomfort, pain and increased susceptibility to 
wider degenerative joint disease. To date, tendon and ligament ultrastructural 
biology is relatively under-studied in healthy, non-diseased tissues. This 
information is essential to understand the pathology of these tissues with 
regard to function-related injury and to assist with the future development of 
tissue-engineered tendon and ligament structures. This study investigated the 
morphological, compositional and extracellular matrix protein distribution 
differences between tendons and ligaments around the non-diseased canine stifle 
joint. The morphological, structural characteristics of different regions of the 
periarticular tendons and ligaments (the intra-articular anterior cruciate 
ligament, the extra-articular medial collateral ligament, the positional long 
digital extensor tendon and energy-storing superficial digital flexor tendons) 
were identified using a novel semi-objective histological scoring analysis and 
by determining their biochemical composition. Protein distribution of 
extracellular matrix collagens, proteoglycans and elastic fibre proteins in 
anterior cruciate ligament and long digital extensor tendon were also determined 
using immunostaining techniques. The anterior cruciate ligament was found to 
have significant morphological differences in comparison with the other three 
tissues, including less compact collagen architecture, differences in cell 
nuclei phenotype and increased glycosaminoglycan and elastin content. Intra- and 
interobserver differences of histology scoring resulted in an average score 0.7, 
indicative of good agreement between observers. Statistically significant 
differences were also found in the extracellular matrix composition in terms of 
glycosaminoglycan and elastin content, being more prominent in the anterior 
cruciate ligament than in the other three tissues. A different distribution of 
several extracellular matrix proteins was also found between long digital 
extensor tendon and anterior cruciate ligament, with a significantly increased 
immunostaining of aggrecan and versican in the anterior cruciate ligament. These 
findings directly relate to the different functions of tendon and ligament and 
indicate that the intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament is subjected to 
more compressive forces, reflecting an adaptive response to normal or increased 
loads and resulting in different extracellular matrix composition and 
arrangement to protect the tissue from damage.

Ankle syndesmosis is crucial to the integrity of the ankle joint and 
weight-bearing; an injury to this structure can lead to significant disability. 
The treatment methods for distal syndesmosis injuries are controversial. The 
representative treatment methods include transsyndesmotic screw fixation and 
suture-button fixation, and good results with suture tape augmentation have 
recently been reported. However, an augmentation using suture tape is only 
possible when the posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) is intact. 
This study describes the case of an unstable syndesmosis injury, accompanied by 
anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) and PITFL injuries, which were 
treated successfully using suture tape. A 39-year-old male patient sustained 
right ankle damage while skateboarding. His leg and ankle radiographs revealed a 
widening of the medial clear space, a posterior malleolus fracture, a reduced 
"syndesmosis overlap" compared with the contralateral side, and a proximal 
fibula fracture. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed ruptured deltoid 
ligaments, accompanied by AITFL, PITFL, and interosseous ligament injuries. A 
diagnosis of a Maisonneuve fracture with an unstable syndesmotic injury was 
made. The patient underwent an open syndesmotic joint reduction, along with an 
AITFL and PITFL augmentation. This anatomical reduction was confirmed using 
intraoperative arthroscopy and postoperative computed tomography (CT). An axial 
CT that was performed at the 6-month follow-up exam revealed a similar alignment 
of the syndesmosis between the injured and uninjured sides. There were no 
surgical complications and the patient did not complain of discomfort in his 
daily life. At the 12-month follow-up exam, a good clinical outcome was 
confirmed. As a treatment for unstable syndesmosis injury, ligament augmentation 
using suture tape shows satisfactory clinical outcomes and can be considered as 
a useful and reliable method for anatomical restoration and rapid 
rehabilitation.

Small Finger Snapping due to Retinacular Ligament Injury at the Level of 
Proximal Interphalangeal Joint: A Case Report.

Pathological snapping secondary to posttraumatic subluxation of the extensor 
tendon at proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) of the finger is rare. Here, we 
want to describe a patient with snapping of the left small finger at PIPJ due to 
retinacular ligament injury. A 24-year-old man was admitted because of a 5-year 
history of a snapping sound in the left small finger. On examination, the radial 
side lateral band of the small finger was dislocated volarly at the level PIPJ 
with flexion of >50°, which was clearly felt over the skin. There was an obvious 
snapping sound at the time of dislocation. There was no specific radiographic 
abnormality. With the patient under regional anesthesia, exploration through a 
zigzag skin incision over the dorsum of the PIPJ revealed that the retinacular 
ligament complex was injured. We also found a partial tear in PIPJ capsule, 
through the incision of the injured retinacular ligament complex. We repaired 
the joint capsule and retinacular ligament complex with prolene 4-0. 
Postoperatively the small finger was immobilized in a below-elbow plaster splint 
with full extension of the fingers for 1 week, then dynamic splinting was 
advised for another 5 weeks and unrestricted full active motion was allowed at 
the 6th week. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient had regained full range of 
motion with no discomfort, and there was no sign of recurrence. We stress that 
when there is snapping over the dorsum of the PIPJ of the finger, the clinician 
should suspect rupture of the retinacular ligaments, especially in minor trauma 
patients. Primary repair of retinacular ligaments and dynamic splinting provided 
satisfactory results without recurrence in our patient.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of pain in people with chronic ankle 
instability (CAI) and how pain is related to the impairments of CAI.
DATA SOURCES: We searched the databases of AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science from inception to March 2017.
STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were peer-reviewed research in which 
investigators reported the presence of ankle pain or assessed the effects of 
pain on impairments in participants with CAI. Age and language were not 
restricted. Studies that included only surgical interventions were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION: Studies identified by the search strategy were screened 
according to the eligibility criteria, and 2 independent reviewers extracted the 
data. Outcome measurements were (1) pain ratings using measures such as a visual 
analog scale and (2) other residual impairments, such as feelings of weakness, 
giving way, or deficits in functional performance.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 5907 records identified through the database search, 14 
studies were included in this review. All authors assessed ankle pain by 
self-report questionnaires or physical examination, or both. Pain was 
self-reported by 23% to 79% of participants and present on physical examination 
in 25% to 75% of participants, depending on the test applied. Among these 
studies, the highest reported pain level was 4.9 on the 11-point visual analog 
scale. Studies were heterogeneous for pain measures, participant groups, 
interventions, and follow-up periods. The relationship between pain and the 
structural and functional impairments associated with CAI was not investigated 
in the included studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain was present in a large proportion of people who had CAI, but 
pain levels were low. Information about the effects of pain was not reported, so 
researchers should examine the association between pain and function, balance, 
or other activities in people with CAI.

We report a new system for monitoring sensations of many body parts as well as 
comprehensively showing the distribution of overall skin temperature (T(sk)) and 
temperature-related sensations. The system consists of a console with 52 levers 
to report temperature-related sensations and software that facilitates the 
visualization of the distribution of T(sk) and temperature-related sensations by 
displaying them on a model of the human body. The system's utility was 
demonstrated with a physiological experiment involving three males and three 
females. They were exposed to step changes of ambient temperature from 23 
degrees C to 33 degrees C. We measured T(sk) at 50 points, and the subjects 
concurrently provided estimates of local temperature sensation and thermal 
comfort/discomfort at 25 loci. This system greatly facilitates the perception 
and analysis of spatial relationships and differences in temperature and 
sensation in various areas of the body.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the abnormal gait of dogs with hip dysplasia by use of 
kinematic gait analysis.
ANIMALS: 19 large-breed dogs with moderate to severe clinical and radiographic 
evidence of hip dysplasia and 10 clinically normal dogs (controls).
PROCEDURE: Kinematic and force plate data were collected, and degree of 
coxofemoral joint abduction-adduction, mediolateral foot movement, distance 
between hind feet, maximum hind foot elevation, mediolateral pelvic movement, 
and coxofemoral joint angular acceleration were calculated. Essential Fourier 
coefficients were determined and used to reconstruct mean angular acceleration 
curves. Fourier coefficients and foot and pelvic movement data were compared 
between groups.
RESULTS: Dogs with hip dysplasia had a greater degree of coxofemoral joint 
adduction and range of abduction-adduction and greater lateral pelvic movement, 
compared with controls. Foot movement variables did not differ significantly 
between groups. Coxofemoral joint angular acceleration was greater in the middle 
to end of the stance phase, whereas deceleration was greater in the late stance 
to early swing phase and middle to end of the swing phase in dogs with hip 
dysplasia, compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Differences in degree of coxofemoral joint 
abduction-adduction, amount of mediolateral pelvic movement, and coxofemoral 
joint angular acceleration between clinically normal dogs and dogs with hip 
dysplasia may indicate a compensation in gait of affected dogs as a result of 
discomfort or biomechanical effects attributable to hip dysplasia and 
degenerative joint disease. Information gained from kinematic and kinetic gait 
analyses may be useful in evaluating treatments for hip dysplasia in dogs.

OBJECTIVE: Treatment of temporomandibular disc displacement with reduction is 
controversial. This study assesses the use of an anterior positioning splint 
with botulinum toxin in the lateral pterygoid muscle (BTX) for such cases.
METHODS: Twelve joints were included; groups I and II received BTX injection 
while group II also received an anterior positioning splint. Pain scores and 
clicking status were recorded at regular intervals then a postoperative MRI was 
done after 4 months.
RESULTS: Clinical improvement was noted in both groups. Mean pain scores dropped 
significantly and clicks in the twelve joints disappeared in 83% of group I and 
33% of group II. MRIs showed significant disc position improvement with the 
higher mean change (1.33 ± 0.76) in group I. Group I showed better improvement 
of discal position and only one joint regained a click. Patients of group II 
reported discomfort from the splint which may have caused psychological distress 
and so worst pain scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Group I  showed slightly better results but the cost of BTX 
injections and the complications of the splint should be kept in mind and the 
decision of treatment selection made according to each condition.

This prospective pilot study aimed to develop a personalized hip brace for 
treating hip subluxation in children with cerebral palsy. Nineteen children, 
aged 1-15, with severe cerebral palsy participated in the study. Customized hip 
braces were created based on 3D scanner measurements and worn for 7 days. The 
primary outcome, Hip Migration Index (MI), and secondary outcomes, including 
range of motion (ROM) in the hip and knee joints, pain intensity, satisfaction, 
discomfort scores, CPCHILD, and wearability test, were assessed. The MI and ROM 
were assessed at screening and at Visit 1 (when the new hip brace was first 
worn), while other indicators were evaluated at screening, Visit 1, and Visit 2 
(7 days after wearing the new hip brace). The study demonstrated significant 
improvements in the MI for the right hip, left hip, and both sides. However, 
there were no statistically significant differences in hip and knee joint ROM. 
Other indicators showed significant changes between screening, Visit 1, and 
Visit 2. The study suggests that customized hip braces effectively achieved 
immediate correction, positively impacting the quality of life and satisfaction 
in children with cerebral palsy. Furthermore, the hip braces have the potential 
to enhance compliance and prevent hip subluxation.Clinical Trial Registration

The incidence of inverted knee osteoarthritis is slowly increasing, there are 
technical limitations in the treatment, and the operation is difficult. In this 
article, we will study the benefits and costs of arthroscopic cleaning 
treatments based on intelligent electronic medicine. This article focuses on 
knee osteoarthritis patients in the EL database. There are 12 male patients, 
accounting for 66.67%, and 6 female patients, accounting for 33.33%. The average 
body mass index (BMI) of the patients was 28.08, the average time from first 
knee discomfort to surgery was 28.44 months, and the average time of 
arthroscopic debridement treatment for patients with VKOH knee osteoarthritis 
was 143.11 minutes. One case of perioperative complication occurred within 35 
days after operation, which was a soleus muscle intermuscular venous thrombosis. 
After immobilization and enhanced anticoagulation for 1 week, it was stable 
without risk of shedding. The average postoperative study time was 20.00 months. 
The electronic medical arthroscopy cleaning treatment plan in this article can 
greatly improve the quality of life of patients and can check the pathological 
state in time, with low cost. In the course of treatment, comprehensive 
treatment costs can be saved by 45%. Arthroscopic clean-up treatment can not 
only reduce knee pain and other uncomfortable symptoms, restore normal knee 
joint function, and improve the quality of life of patients, but also correct 
the unequal length of the lower limbs, thereby avoiding spinal degeneration 
caused by knee instability. Therefore, it is the first choice for the treatment 
of advanced knee osteoarthritis in patients with VKOH.

The study investigated the effects of wearing two new designs of cotton glove on 
several hand performance capabilities and compared them against the effects of 
barehanded, single-layered and double cotton glove conditions when working with 
hand tools (screwdriver and pliers). The new glove designs were based on the 
findings of subjective hand discomfort assessments for this type of work and 
aimed to match the glove thickness to the localised pressure and sensitivity in 
different areas of the hand as well as to provide adequate dexterity for fine 
manipulative tasks. The results showed that the first prototype glove and the 
barehanded condition were comparable and provided better dexterity and higher 
handgrip strength than double thickness gloves. The results support the 
hypothesis that selective thickness in different areas of the hand could be 
applied by glove manufacturers to improve the glove design, so that it can 
protect the hands from the environment and at the same time allow optimal hand 
performance capabilities.

BACKGROUND: Menopausal symptoms can be assessed by several tools, and can be 
influenced by various socio-demographic factors.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the commonly reported menopausal symptoms among 
Sarawakian women using a modified Menopause Rating Scale (MRS).
METHODS: By using modified MRS questionnaire, 356 Sarawakian women aged 40-65 
years were interview to document of 11 symptoms (divided into somatic, 
psychological and urogenital domain) commonly associated with menopause.
RESULTS: The mean age of menopause was 51.3 years (range 47 - 56 years). The 
most prevalent symptoms reported were joint and muscular discomfort (80.1%); 
physical and mental exhaustion (67.1%); and sleeping problems (52.2%). Followed 
by symptoms of hot flushes and sweating (41.6%); irritability (37.9%); dryness 
of vagina (37.9%); anxiety (36.5%); depressive mood (32.6%). Other complaints 
noted were sexual problem (30.9%); bladder problem (13.8%) and heart discomfort 
(18.3%). Perimenopausal women (n = 141) experienced higher prevalence of somatic 
and psychological symptoms compared to premenopausal (n = 82) and postmenopausal 
(n = 133) women. However urogenital symptoms mostly occur in the postmenopausal 
group of women.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of menopausal symptoms using modified MRS in this 
study correspond to other studies on Asian women however the prevalence of 
classical menopausal symptoms of hot flushes, sweating was lower compared to 
studies on Caucasian women.

The compound ibuprofen, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid, has been known e.g. 
from Martindale, the Extra Pharmacopoeia, 28(th) edition, 1982, p.256, as a drug 
which had anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It is used for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory diseases of joints, soft 
tissue rheumatism and gout. Ibuprofen, because of its analgesic properties, has 
been widely used as anodyne, e.g. against pain or discomfort associated with 
headache, toothache or menstruation.A medication suitable to combat acute pain 
is demanded to display its effects fast which action, in turn, is only achieved 
by a quick release and good bio-availability of the active-ingredient. It is for 
the commercial forms in particular that the conditions of preparation must be 
strictly observed, as minor alterations in production procedures such as mixing, 
pressure of compression and type of machine will affect the physical properties 
of the particles of he active ingredient and will deteriorate its 
bio-availability. It is an object of this presentation to provide a medicament 
that can be readily taken that contains an active amount of ibuprofen in a 
carrier, that is simple to prepare and that will quickly display a high 
activity.

BACKGROUND: Joint pain and swelling are typical symptoms in children with 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and these are often related to inflammation 
of the joint. Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (JOCD), that is separation of a 
bone-cartilage segment from the articular surface, can manifest with similar 
symptoms.
FINDINGS: We studied thirteen cases of osteochondritis dissecans lesions (OCD) 
in children with JIA. There were nine girls and four boys with a mean age of 6.5 
(2-12) years at the time of diagnosis of JIA. Mean time between diagnosis of JIA 
and manifestation of OCD was 5.5 (1-11) years. Indications for MRI were the 
presence of pain or discomfort in the joint, despite otherwise effective 
treatment, with no evidence from ultrasound examination of any obvious signs of 
active inflammation. The most common location of osteochondral lesion was the 
knee, although the ankle joint was affected in one case. Five patients had 
lesions in both knees. Operative treatment was needed in eight cases (joints).
CONCLUSIONS: Pain, and minor dysfunction of the joint are common complaints of 
children suffering from JIA. Earlier research has discounted the possibility of 
children who were not athletes presenting with this condition. However, this 
study demonstrates that these lesions also seem to be relatively common in 
patients with JIA. When there is no sign of inflammation, the possibility of OCD 
must therefore be considered in these children.

BACKGROUND: Wrist pain on the ulnar side is often caused by ulnar impaction 
syndrome (UIS). Idiopathic UIS requires surgical treatment when conservative 
treatment fails. The 2 main surgical procedures used are the wafer procedure and 
ulnar shortening osteotomy (USO) of the metaphysis or diaphysis. This review 
aimed to analyze comparative studies of the 2 procedures in UIS to determine 
clinical outcomes and complications.
METHODS: One prospective and 5 retrospective comparison trials were retrieved 
from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. The primary outcomes 
were treatment effectiveness; pain visual analog scale (VAS), disabilities of 
the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, Mayo wrist, and Darrow scores. The 
incidence of postoperative complications formed the secondary outcome.
RESULTS: The selected studies included 107 patients who underwent the wafer 
procedure (G1) and 117 patients who underwent USO (G2). The wafer procedure had 
the benefits of less postoperative immobilization and an early return to work. 
However, there were no significant differences in the postoperative pain 
improvement and functional scores. All 6 studies reported high total 
complication rates and reoperation with USO. The most frequent complication was 
implant-related discomfort or irritation; subsequent plate removal was the most 
common reason for a secondary operation.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in pain improvement or the postoperative 
functional score between the groups. Nevertheless, postoperative complications 
were the major pitfalls of USO. As the specialized shortening system advances 
further, a high-level study will be necessary to determine the surgical option 
in UIS.

Beyond its effect on vegetative functions, the activation of the vagus nerve 
inhibits inflammation and reduces pain signaling. The aim of this open-label 
pilot study was to determine the efficacy and tolerance of transcutaneous 
auricular VNS (taVNS) on erosive hand osteoarthritis (EHOA) symptoms. 
Symptomatic EHOA patients with hand pain VAS ≥ 40/100 mm and ≥1 interphalangeal 
swollen joint(s) were included. The taVNS was performed for 4 weeks using an 
auricular electrode applied one hour per day and connected to a TENS device with 
pre-established settings. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by changes between 
baseline and at 4 weeks with hand pain VAS and the functional index FIHOA score, 
using a Wilcoxon t-test. The treatment tolerance was also evaluated. Eighteen 
patients (median age 69 years old, 83% women) were analyzed. At baseline, hand 
pain VAS was 60 mm [IQR 50; 78.2] and FIHOA 15 [10.7; 20.2]. After 4 weeks, 
taVNS significantly reduced hand pain VAS, with a median decrease of 23.5 mm 
[7.7; 37.2] (p = 0.001), as well as FIHOA, with a median decrease of 2 points 
[0.75; 5.2] (p = 0.01). No serious adverse events were reported. One patient 
stopped taVNS because of auricular discomfort. This first proof-of-concept trial 
indicated that taVNS is feasible and may decrease joint inflammation and 
clinical symptoms in EHOA, arguing for a randomized controlled study versus sham 
stimulation.

Synovitis is an inflammatory process associated with pain, disability, and 
discomfort, which is usually treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or biological 
agents. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been also successfully used in the 
treatment of inflammatory-related diseases such as synovitis or arthritis. In 
the last years, the exosomes derived from MSCs have become a promising tool for 
the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases and their therapeutic effect is 
thought to be mediated (at least in part) by their immunomodulatory potential. 
In this work, we aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of these 
exosomes in an antigen-induced synovitis animal model. To our knowledge, this is 
the first report where exosomes derived from MSCs have been evaluated in an 
animal model of synovitis. Our results demonstrated a decrease of synovial 
lymphocytes together with a downregulation of TNF-α transcripts in those 
exosome-treated joints. These results support the immunomodulatory effect of 
these exosomes and point out that they may represent a promising therapeutic 
option for the treatment of synovitis.

Sesamoid osteonecrosis is a disabling condition resulting in severe forefoot 
pain, for which there are limited treatment options. We present a 52-year-old 
man with 1-year history of pain, aggravated by walking and playing tennis. On 
examination, pain was localised to plantar aspect of the first 
metatarsophalangeal joint. Imaging revealed evolving end-stage avascular 
necrosis of lateral sesamoid with early secondary degenerative changes. Previous 
exhaustive conservative treatment had been unsuccessful in alleviating his pain. 
As an alternative to surgery, radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) 
was proposed. Treatment protocol was 2000 pulses at frequency of 5 Hz, and 
pressure was varied from 1.2 to 1.8 bar according to patient tolerance. A total 
of eight sessions were delivered. At completion of treatment, the patient 
reported minimal discomfort to no pain and was able to return to playing tennis 
with no recurrence. We propose rESWT to be an effective novel conservative 
treatment for sesamoid osteonecrosis.

Poor visual ergonomics is associated with visual and neck/shoulder discomfort, 
but the relation between visual demands and neck/shoulder muscle activity is 
unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate whether trapezius muscle 
activity was affected by: (i) eye-lens accommodation; (ii) incongruence between 
accommodation and convergence; and (iii) presence of neck/shoulder discomfort. 
Sixty-six participants (33 controls and 33 with neck pain) performed visually 
demanding near work under four different trial-lens conditions. Results showed 
that eye-lens accommodation per se did not affect trapezius muscle activity 
significantly. However, when incongruence between accommodation and convergence 
was present, a significant positive relationship between eye-lens accommodation 
and trapezius muscle activity was found. There were no significant 
group-differences. It was concluded that incongruence between accommodation and 
convergence is an important factor in the relation between visually demanding 
near work and trapezius muscle activity. The relatively low demands on 
accommodation and convergence in the present study imply that visually demanding 
near work may contribute to increased muscle activity, and over time to the 
development of near work related neck/shoulder discomfort.

Coxalgia causes osteocartilaginous destructions of the hip joint; these lesions 
are responsible for severe pain leading to functional discomfort and limitations 
in everyday life. Their surgical treatment is still not well established. The 
aim of our study was to demonstrate the interest of total hip arthroplasty 
associated with anti-tuberculous chemotherapy to improve patients' quality of 
life. We report a retrospective study of 10 cases of total hip replacement 
following coxalgia at the Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma of Rabat 
University Hospital from 2002 to 2011. The average age of our patients was 38 
years. The discovery of coxalgia was made under different circumstances 
according to the patients. The surgical approach we used was exclusively 
posterolateral (Moore). All prostheses were cemented. Four patients required 
acetabulum reconstruction. Intraoperative biopsy was positive in a patient, 
negative in the remaining nine. All patients underwent anti-tuberculous 
treatment. No recurrence was noted after a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Results 
according to Merle d'Aubigné score were considered good. In case of advanced 
bone destruction with badly tolerated functional impact in mature subject, total 
hip arthroplasty always associated with effective anti-tuberculous chemotherapy 
is the treatment of choice for sequelae of coxalgia.

La coxalgie entraine des destructions ostéo-cartilagineuses de l'articulation de 
la hanche, ces lésions sont responsables de douleurs intenses provoquant des 
gènes fonctionnelles et des limitations dans la vie quotidienne. Leur traitement 
chirurgical est encore mal codifié. Notre objectif est de montrer à travers 
cette étude l'intérêt de l'arthroplastie totale de hanche associée à la 
chimiothérapie antituberculeuse pour l'amélioration de la qualité de vie des 
patients. Nous rapportons une étude rétrospective portant sur 10 cas de 
prothèses totales de hanche posées sur séquelles de coxalgie au service de 
traumatologie-orthopédie du centre hospitalier universitaire Rabat de 2002 à 
2011. L’âge moyen de nos patients est de 38 ans. La découverte de la coxalgie 
s'est faite dans des circonstances différentes en fonction des patients. La voie 
d'abord que nous avons utilisé est exclusivement postéro-externe de Moore. Les 
prothèses posées ont toute été cimentées. Quatre patients ont nécessité la 
reconstruction du cotyle. La biopsie peropératoire est positive chez un patient, 
négative chez les neuf restants. Tous les patients ont été mis sous traitement 
antituberculeux. Aucune récidive n'a été notée après un recul minimal de 3 ans. 
Les résultats selon la cotation de Merle d'Aubigné sont jugés bons. En cas de 
destruction osseuse avancée avec retentissement fonctionnel très mal supporté 
chez le sujet d’âge mûr, l'arthroplastie totale demeure le traitement de choix 
des séquelles de coxalgie sous couverture systématique d'une chimiothérapie 
antituberculeuse efficace.

Patients With Suspected Face-mediated Chronic Back Pain.

BACKGROUND: Preoperative exposure to opioids has recently shown to be associated 
with poor outcomes after elective major surgery, but little is known as to how 
pretreatment opioid use affects results of interventional back pain management.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effect of pretreatment opioid use on 
outcomes after interventional pain management procedures on patients with 
chronic back pain.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
SETTING: Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Satakunta Central 
Hospital (Satasairaala), Finland.
METHODS: A high-volume, single-center, quality register analysis was performed 
on patients who underwent interventional pain management for suspected 
facet-mediated chronic back pain as a part of a multidisciplinary pain 
management program. Chronic opioid use was defined as having a concurrent opioid 
prescription for 90 days.
RESULTS: A total of 797 patients underwent an intervention during the study 
period from August 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. Pretreatment opioid use 
was present in 262 patients (33%). Patients with chronic back pain using opioids 
reported significantly more pain and discomfort before treatment as well as 
lowered working ability. Facet joint medial branch blocks resulted in 
significant improvement for both groups directly after the treatment as well as 
at 2-hours follow-up. However, the nonopioid group reported significantly more 
improvement at 2-days follow-up as well as at one month follow-up compared to 
opioid users. Opioid users reported nearly the same pain level at one-month 
follow-up as they did before treatment.
LIMITATIONS: As a single-center analysis, these data may not be generalizable to 
other institutions. A retrospective study may include inevitable bias. The 
disease processes themselves may possibly predispose patients to different 
degrees of opoid use. Although we have identified preoperative opioid use as a 
risk factor for treatment failure, we were unable to determine the size of the 
association based on our statistical analysis and sample size. Pain intensity 
evaluation using the visual analog scale is inevitably subjective.
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment opioid use is associated with greater pain discomfort, 
impairment, and reduced functional ability, as well as poorer long-term effect 
of interventional back pain treatment at one-month follow-up. In our study, 
opioid users reported the same positive effects of facet joint nerve blocks 
immediately after the treatment and 2 hours after the treatment, but a 
significantly smaller effect at one-month follow-up. This could indicate that 
opioid use may diminish the effects of pain treatments by affecting relearning, 
behavioral changes, and central pain modulation. These findings may help 
providers understand the effect of pretreatment opioid use on patient care, and 
its implications on hospital and societal costs.

A 67-year-old woman underwent a routine and uneventful elective total knee 
arthroplasty for osteoarthritis at our centre. No intraoperative nor immediate 
postoperative complications were noted clinically nor radiologically. At 5 weeks 
postoperative, she began to notice some new discomfort in her upper calf area, 
with no preceding history of trauma. A Doppler ultrasound scan ruled out a deep 
vein thrombus. Only on further re-imaging of her knee with X-rays and CT was 
there shown to be a fibular fracture of the proximal third with evidence of 
callus formation. The pain arising from her stress fracture delayed her 
rehabilitation slightly, going on to require a successful manipulation under 
anaesthetic (0°-95°). She went on to have excellent function in her knee and the 
pain from the stress fracture had settled by 5 months.

Treatment of mandibular condyle fractures is controversial. Open treatment 
achieves anatomic reduction with occlusal stability and faster functional 
recovery but risks facial nerve injury and jeopardizes joint capsule circulation 
which can lead to bone resorption. Traditional closed treatment avoids these 
issues but requires prolonged fixation and risks subsequent facial asymmetry, 
occlusal disturbance, and ankylosis. Rather than wires, closed treatment with 
elastics allows for customizable management of a healing fracture with ability 
to alter vector and degree of traction to restore vertical height and occlusion 
with less discomfort and decreased risk for ankylosis. In this protocol, 
unilateral condylar fractures were treated with class II elastics ipsilateral to 
injury and class I contralaterally. Class III elastics were used contralaterally 
if additional traction was required and Class II elastics were placed 
bilaterally for bilateral fractures. Patients were sequentially advanced from 
fixating to guiding to supportive elastics by titrating elastic vector to any 
dental midline incongruency or chin deviation. Six patients were treated with 
this protocol with six-month follow-up. Fracture patterns included displaced and 
dislocated fractures as well as intracapsular and extracapsular condylar 
fractures. All patients at completion of the protocol had objective centric 
occlusion with no subjective malocclusion, chin deviation, facial asymmetry, or 
temporomandibular joint pain. These early data demonstrate a safe and 
efficacious innovative protocol for closed treatment of mandibular condylar 
fractures with dynamic elastic therapy.

Locked pubic symphysis is a rare form of pelvic injury. It occasionally occurs 
after a lateral compression injury of the pelvis. We described an overlapping 
pubic symphysis dislocation that was locked into the contralateral obturator 
foramen. To the best of our knowledge, there are about seventeen similar cases 
reported in the literature. The pubic symphysis was finally reduced by means of 
a superior pubic ramus osteotomy to unlock the incarcerated pubic body out of 
the contralateral obturator foramen. As the reduction was unstable, the pubic 
symphysis was fixed with a reconstruction plate. The patient recovered 
completely and returned to normal activities within 4months. At 1year's 
follow-up she reported no discomfort in the pubic symphysis region and was able 
to void urine normally.

Kneeling is required during daily living for many patients after total knee 
replacement (TKR), yet many patients have reported that they cannot kneel due to 
pain, or avoid kneeling due to discomfort, which critically impacts quality of 
life and perceived success of the TKR procedure. The objective of this study was 
to evaluate the effect of component design on patellofemoral (PF) mechanics 
during a kneeling activity. A computational model to predict natural and 
implanted PF kinematics and bone strains after kneeling was developed and 
kinematics were validated with experimental cadaveric studies. PF joint 
kinematics and patellar bone strains were compared for implants with dome, 
medialized dome, and anatomic components. Due to the less conforming nature of 
the designs, change in sagittal plane tilt as a result of kneeling at 90° knee 
flexion was approximately twice as large for the medialized-dome and dome 
implants as the natural case or anatomic implant, which may result in additional 
stretching of the quadriceps. All implanted cases resulted in substantial 
increases in bone strains compared with the natural knee, but increased strains 
in different regions. The anatomic patella demonstrated increased strains 
inferiorly, while the dome and medialized dome showed increases centrally. An 
understanding of the effect of implant design on patellar mechanics during 
kneeling may ultimately provide guidance to component designs that reduces the 
likelihood of knee pain and patellar fracture during kneeling.

Obstructive sleep apnea and hipoapnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a disorder that 
affects about 4% of the adult population, and besides the social problems 
associated to snoring and extreme day time sleepiness, it is preoccupying since 
it may cause pulmonary hypertension and cardiac failure.
REVIEW AND DISCUSSION: Through a literature review, we discuss the use of oral 
appliances to treat this condition, in regards of therapy effectiveness and 
limitations, main clinical symptoms, major occlusal side effects, rate of 
improvement and patient satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the use of oral appliances should be a first 
choice treatment for mild to moderate OSAHS, being dental, joint and muscular 
discomforts, hypersalivation and xerostomia, the most frequent clinical 
symptoms, with light occlusal side effects that normally do not bother the 
patients, with a good degree of improvement and high satisfaction index.

BACKGROUND: Inadvertent intravascular injection of local anesthetics can lead to 
false-negative results following lumbar medial branch block (MBB) performed to 
diagnose facet joint origin pain. A previous study demonstrated that the type of 
approach method could affect the incidence of intravascular injections and 
technical ease of the procedure.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of our study was to compare the incidence of 
inadvertent intravascular injection and technical ease of the MBB between 
anteroposterior (AP) and oblique (OB) views.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial.
SETTING: An interventional pain management practice in South Korea.
METHODS: The incidence of intravascular uptake of contrast medium was compared 
using AP and OB fluoroscopic views during lumbar MBB. Injection time, radiation 
dose, and patient discomfort during lumbar MBB were also compared. Risk factors 
associated with a longer procedure time and a higher radiation dose were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: The incidence of intravascular injection was 22.5% (23/102) in the AP 
group and 17.6% (18/102) in the OB group (P = 0.382). A significantly longer 
injection time and a higher dose of radiation were required to complete 3 levels 
of MBB in the OB group than in the AP group (45.9 seconds vs 61.9 seconds, P = 
0.001; 27.4 centigray [cGy]/cm2 vs 42.2 cGy/cm2, I = 0.004). The OB approach and 
left side injection were the risk factors associated with a longer total 
procedure time (odds ratio [OR] = 6.64, 95% CI, 1.99-22.17, P = 0.002; OR = 
0.20, 95% CI, 0.06-0.67, P = 0.009, OB and AP, respectively).
LIMITATIONS: The physician performing the MBB could recognize the AP or OB 
fluoroscopic view during procedure.
CONCLUSION: The overall incidence rate of intravascular injection during lumbar 
MBB showed nearly 20% in both approach methods groups. The OB approach and left 
side MBBs were associated with a longer total procedure time and a higher 
radiation dose.

BACKGROUND: Patients are often made weightbearing as tolerated (WBAT) in a 
controlled ankle motion (CAM) boot for the management of various foot and ankle 
conditions. The CAM boot causes a leg length discrepancy (LLD) between the 
booted (longer) and contralateral (shorter) lower extremities. This discrepancy 
can potentially cause balance problems, undue strain on joints, and discomfort 
in patients. We hypothesized that a leg length-evening orthotic placed on the 
plantar aspect of the contralateral shoe improves balance among patients who are 
WBAT in a CAM boot.
METHODS: Patients made WBAT in a CAM boot were randomized to either the leg 
length-evening orthotic intervention group or to a control group in which 
patients wore a normal shoe of their choice. Patients were followed for 2 weeks 
and asked a series of questions pertaining to balance and pain experienced at 
their knees, hips, and back. Balance was the primary outcome and was scored from 
0 (no difficulty with balance) to 10 (great difficulty with balance). Of 107 
subjects enrolled and randomized, 95 (88.8%) completed the study, satisfying the 
a priori sample size requirement of 94 patients. There were no differences in 
baseline characteristics between groups (P > .05 for each).
RESULTS: Intervention patients reported less difficulty with balance than 
control patients (intention-to-treat analysis: 2.0±1.5 vs 3.2±1.8, P = .001; 
as-treated analysis: 2.1±1.7 vs 3.0±1.7, P = .009). Intervention and control 
patients did not differ with respect to pain experienced at their knees, hips, 
or back, or in a composite total pain score (P > .05 for each).
CONCLUSION: This multicenter randomized controlled trial found that adding a 
limb length-evening orthotic to the plantar aspect of the contralateral shoe in 
a patient that is WBAT in a CAM boot improved patient-reported self-assessment 
of balance. The trial was powered to identify a difference in the primary 
outcome measure of balance and may have been insufficiently powered to identify 
differences in knee, hip, back, or total pain.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study.

Effect of Physiotherapeutic Rehabilitation on a Patient With an Iliac Fracture, 
and Superior and Inferior Pubic Rami Fracture With Foot Drop: A Case Report.

The sacroiliac joint is frequently broken apart by high-energy trauma, which 
increases fatalities and complications from pelvic injuries. Ilium fractures are 
high-energy pelvic fractures that often progress from the iliac crest to the 
greater sciatic notch. Concomitant head injury exsanguinations and 
uncontrollable bleeding within the pelvis are considered important causes of 
mortality. In contrast, some assume that such extensive bleeding is extremely 
uncommon and that accompanying injuries could result in increased mortality. A 
shorter healing period and faster patient mobilization are possible with 
surgically treated Tile's type B and C fractures. Accident-related fractures can 
lead to decreased independence and functioning, restricted mobility, lowered 
self-confidence, and a worse quality of life; these fractures are caused by 
trauma, most frequently from minor falls and age-related osteopenia. By reducing 
discomfort, restoring range of motion and muscular strength, and assisting with 
early ambulation/loading of the fractured limb, early physical therapy 
intervention speeds up the clinical recovery of patients with fractures.  When 
one cannot elevate the forefoot, it results in foot drop because of a lack of 
dorsiflexor strength in the foot. These may induce a risky antalgic gait, 
leading to falls-the diminished ability to lift the foot of the ankle or the 
toes (dorsiflexion). Injuries, including fractures, joint dislocations, or hip 
replacement surgery, can also result in a drop foot. The peroneal nerve, which 
innervates the tibialis anterior, is the muscle responsible for dorsiflexion, as 
it arises from the sciatic nerve's branch. Due to the foot drop, the anterior 
tibialis muscle will shorten and cause spasms in the calf muscle. After surgery, 
the patient was dependent and had difficulty going about his everyday life. 
However, the physiotherapy intervention improved the patient's pain and physical 
functionality. By lowering discomfort, restoring range of motion and muscular 
strength, and facilitating early ambulation/loading of the fractured limb, this 
study shows that combining definitive surgical methods with early physical 
therapy intervention speeds up the clinical recovery of patients with fractures.

The main therapeutic options for extensive scarring (e.g., > 20% of the total 
body surface area, or TBSA) after burns and trauma have focused on conservative 
treatments, such as compression, moisturization, and topical agent application. 
However, these treatments may not achieve optimal effects due to the large size 
and complexity of the scars. UltraPulse fractional CO2 laser treatment is a 
novel approach that is currently a subject of intense interest; this treatment 
is most widely used to improve texture, pliability, and pigmentation in all 
types of scars. However, no studies on the independent use of UltraPulse 
fractional CO2 laser treatment for extensive scars have been reported. This 
retrospective study evaluated a total of 21 patients, whose scars covered 20 to 
65% TBSA. Scar thickness was measured by ultrasonography before treatment. 
Personalized treatment modalities and parameters were set according to the scar 
type and thickness. Scar formation and treatment effects were evaluated by 
photography, the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), and 
patients' judgment of effectiveness. Where the scars covered joints, joint 
function was assessed by measuring the maximum range of motion (ROM). With laser 
therapy, scars became flatter and lighter; furthermore, pruritus, pain, and 
discomfort decreased significantly. POSAS scores significantly decreased after 
laser therapy, including the item scores for pain and pruritus. There were no 
instances of joint contracture, ROM reduction, apparent functional impairment, 
serious adverse events, or comorbidities. This study demonstrates the safety and 
efficiency of UltraPulse fractional CO2 laser treatment for extensive scarring.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of UP1306 on discomfort 
and function in adults with osteoarthritis of the knee. In a randomized, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel design, 135 subjects received 
UP1306, a standardized, proprietary extract of Morus alba and Acacia catechu, 
glucosamine chondroitin, or placebo for 12 weeks. Discomfort, stiffness, and 
activities of daily living measured by the WOMAC questionnaire and VAS 
(pain/discomfort) were improved within all groups. Range of motion and distance 
walked were improved. There were no changes in TNFα levels for any of the 
products. There was a significant difference in urinary C-telopeptides of type 
II collagen (CTX-II), a marker of cartilage degradation between UP1306, and 
placebo after 12 weeks (p = 0.029). All efficacy measurements were improved from 
baseline to most time-points for UP1306, the comparator, and placebo without a 
significant association between the products. There was a significant difference 
between the changes of uCTX-II for UP1306 and placebo after 12 weeks. Early 
intervention with UP1306 aimed at reducing bone and cartilage degradation 
through reported inhibition of catabolic proinflammatory pathways may help to 
prevent joint cartilage damage. This study is registered with Clinical Trial ID 
ISRCTN15418623.

BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a proliferative condition that 
affects the cells of bone tissue. There are no specific clinical signs or 
imaging manifestations in the early stages of the disease, making it simple to 
overlook and misdiagnose. Because of the disease's rarity, there is presently no 
standardized treatment principle. There are few accounts of such occurrences 
affecting the axis among children. We discovered a case of a child whose EG 
resulted in atlantoaxial joint dislocation and destruction of the axial bone.
CASE SUMMARY: After having pharyngeal discomfort for more than six months 
without a clear explanation, a 6-year-old boy was brought to our hospital. 
Following a careful evaluation, the pathology indicated a strong likelihood of 
an axial EG. Ultimately, we decided to treat the boy with posterior pedicle 
screw fixation and local steroid injections.
CONCLUSION: EGs of the upper cervical spine are quite uncommon in children, and 
they are exceedingly easy to overlook or misdiagnose. Posterior pedicle screw 
fixation and local steroid injections are effective treatments for patients with 
axial EGs affecting the atlantoaxial junction.

The main complaints in extensor tendon dislocations are pain, swelling, sense of 
discomfort, snapping and difficulty in writing and forceful flexion. However, 
congenital extensor tendon subluxations may present with triggering of the 
fingers due to tendon dislocations. Unnecessary A1 pulley release may be 
performed for pseudotriggerring with unsuccessful results. Here, we report an 
unusual case of congenital extensor tendon subluxation of multiple digits with 
triggering of the left little finger and aim to attract notice to 
pseudotriggering of the digits due to tendon dislocations. An extensor hood 
reconstruction performed by an extensor digitorum communis tendon slip which is 
passed beneath the deep intermetacarpal ligament is a successful choice of 
treatment for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Bone loss following open fracture or infected gap nonunion is a 
difficult situation to manage. There are many modes of treatment such as bone 
grafting, vascularized bone grafting and bone transport by illizarov and 
monolateral fixator. We evaluated the outcome of rail fixator treatment in 
reconstructing bone and limb function. We felt that due to problems such as 
heavy apparatus, persistent pain, deformity of joints and discomfort caused by 
an Ilizarov ring fixator, rail fixator is a good alternative to treat bone gaps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 patients (17 males and 3 females with mean age 30.5 
years) who suffered bone loss due to open fracture and chronic osteomyelitis 
leading to infected gap nonunion. Ten patients suffered an open fracture 
(Gustilo type II and type III) and 10 patients suffered bone gap following 
excision of necrotic bone after infected nonunion. There were 19 cases of tibia 
and one case of humerus. All patients were treated with debridement and 
stabilization of fracture with a rail fixator. Further treatment involved 
reconstructing bone defect by corticotomy at an appropriate level and 
distraction by rail fixator.
RESULT: We achieved union in all cases. The average bone gap reconstructed was 
7.72 cm (range 3.5-15.5 cm) in 9 months (range 6-14 months). Normal range of 
motion in nearby joint was achieved in 80% cases. We had excellent to good limb 
function in 85% of cases as per the association for the study and application of 
the method of ilizarov scoring system[ASAMI] score.
CONCLUSION: All patients well tolerated rail fixator with good functional 
results and gap reconstruction. Easy application of rail fixator and comfortable 
distraction procedure suggest rail fixator a good alternative for gap 
reconstruction of limbs.

BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common cause of pain, weakness, 
sensory loss, and activity limitations. Currently, the most common initial 
treatment is use of a rigid splint immobilizing the wrist, usually during 
night-time, for several weeks. Evidence regarding the efficacy and effect 
durability of wrist splinting is weak. The treatment is associated with costs 
and may cause discomfort and limit daily and work activities. No 
placebo-controlled trials have been performed.
METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy 
of a rigid wrist splint compared with soft wrist bandage (placebo) in patients 
with primary idiopathic CTS. The trial will be conducted at an orthopedic 
department. Patients, 25 to 65 years old, who seek primary health-care with 
symptoms of CTS will be screened, and potentially eligible patients will be 
referred to the study center. Patients who fulfill the trial's eligibility 
criteria will be invited to participate. A total of 112 patients who provide 
informed consent will be randomly assigned to treatment with either a rigid 
wrist splint or a soft bandage to be used initially for 6 weeks at night and, if 
possible, during the day. The splints and bandages will be fitted with a 
temperature-monitoring device to measure the total time during which they have 
actually been worn. The trial participants will complete a questionnaire that 
includes the 6-item CTS symptoms scale (CTS-6); the 11-item disabilities of the 
arm, shoulder, and hand (QuickDASH) scale; and the EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) 
health status and quality-of-life measure at baseline and at 6, 12, 24, and 
52 weeks after treatment start. The participants will undergo physical 
examination and nerve conduction testing at baseline and at 52 weeks. The 
trial's primary outcomes are the change in the CTS-6 score from baseline to 
12 weeks and the rate of carpal tunnel release surgery at 52 weeks.
DISCUSSION: This is the first placebo-controlled randomized trial with 
electronic monitoring of actual splint use and will provide evidence regarding 
the efficacy of wrist splinting in patients with CTS.

BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty provides satisfactory outcomes, but 
its cost-effectiveness is unproven. We prospectively analyzed outcomes and costs 
for primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
METHODS: Thirty serial patients (16 women and 14 men; mean age, 74.1 years 
[range, 61.1-87.3 years]) with rotator cuff arthropathy had active motion 
recorded and completed function tests (visual pain analog scale; Simple Shoulder 
Test; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Outcome score; EuroQol; and 
Short Form-36 Health Survey) preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 and 2 
years. Costs included professional fees, operating room and supply costs, and 
hospital care. Changes were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and 
quality-adjusted life-years were calculated preoperatively and postoperatively.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the study. Clinical and functional 
outcomes demonstrated significant improvement (P < .05). Significantly improved 
(P < .05) Short Form-36 subgroups included physical functioning, role 
limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, vitality, and physical 
composite score. EuroQol dimensions of usual activities and pain/discomfort 
improved significantly (P < .05). Calculations with the SF-6D showed that median 
QALYs improved from 6.56 preoperatively to 7.43 at 1-year follow-up (P <.09) and 
from 6.56 preoperatively to 7.58 at 2-year follow-up (P <.003). The increase in 
QALYs calculated from the EQ-5D was somewhat greater, changing from 6.21 
preoperatively to 7.69 at 1-year follow-up (P <.0001) and from 6.13 to 8.10 at 
2-year follow-up (P <.04). Mean cost was $21,536. Cost utility at 2 years was 
$26,920/quality-adjusted life-year by the Short Form 6 Dimensions and 
$16,747/quality-adjusted life-year by the EuroQol.
CONCLUSION: EuroQol and Short Form-36 results demonstrated modestly 
cost-effective (<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year) improvement for cuff tear 
arthropathy patients after primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

OBJECTIVE: To give a reference for the early diagnosis and treatment of the 
cysts arising from the temporomandibular joint.
METHODS: Nine patients finally diagnosed as temporomandibular joint cysts at the 
Peking University Hospital of Stomatology from May 1998 to August 2013 were 
selected and reviewed. Their clinical manifestations, imaging features, 
diagnoses and differential diagnoses, treatments and follow-ups were summarized 
and discussed.
RESULTS: In the 9 patients, 3 were males and 6 females. Their ages ranged from 
33 to 62 years with a median age of 39 years; the course of the disease ranged 
from 2 weeks to 3 years with a median of 4 months. The image examinations were 
performed with conventional X-ray examinations in 7 cases, CT scans in 8 cases, 
MRI in 6 cases and ultrasound in one case. Of the 9 cases, 7 were finally 
diagnosed as ganglion cyst and 2 as synovial cyst. Ganglion cysts mainly 
presented as the mass of preauricular area or joint area, with no obvious 
symptoms or only local discomfort, occasionally with pain. The synovial cysts 
manifested as the painful swelling of preauricular area and limited 
mouth-opening, accompanying with occlusal disorders. The treatments included 
surgical resection in 8 cases, repeated arthrocenteses and lavages in one case. 
The follow-ups were from 3 months to 9 years, one case with recurrence, and the 
remaining eight cases without recurrence.
CONCLUSION: MRI examinations are very helpful in the early diagnosis and 
treatment planning of temporomandibular joint cysts. Surgical resection can have 
good results. Repeated arthrocenteses and lavages also have a good result, which 
may be an alternative choice for synovial cyst, but more accumulation of 
clinical experience is further needed.

Kingdom.

PURPOSE: To establish if a positive impingement sign in femoroacetabular 
impingement (FAI) may result from entrapment of the fat pad located at the 
anterior head-neck junction of the upper femur. This fat pad is routinely 
removed before any cam lesion excision.
METHODS: We report a prospective study of 142 consecutive hip arthroscopies for 
symptomatic FAI where the aim was to remove the arthroscopically identified area 
of impingement, not necessarily to create a spherical femoral head. Patients 
were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 92; 34 females, 58 males), where a 
cam-type bony FAI lesion was identified and excised in addition to the fat pad 
which overlay it, and Group 2 (n = 50; 29 females, 21 males) where the only 
identified point of impingement was a prominent fat pad. In this situation the 
fat pad was excised in isolation and the underlying bone preserved. Patients 
were assessed preoperatively, at six weeks, six months, one year and two years 
with a modified Harris hip score (mHHS).
RESULTS: Both groups were comparable preoperatively for mean age, mean alpha 
angle and mean anterior offset ratio. Both groups improved significantly after 
surgery at all time points. However, Group 1 (fat pad and bone resection) 
demonstrated 16.0% improvement in mHHS by two years while for Group 2 (fat pad 
resection only) the improvement was 18.9% (p = 0.628).
CONCLUSIONS: The fat pad found at the anterior head/neck junction of the hip 
joint can be a source of pain and we propose fat pad entrapment as a new, 
previously undescribed diagnosis. Our findings also suggest that a large number 
of cam lesions are being excised unnecessarily and that further efforts should 
be made to understand the role of the fat pad as a source of groin discomfort.

BACKGROUND: Paediatric rheumatic diseases cause considerable disease burden to 
children and their families (Moorthy LN, Peterson MGE, Hassett AL, et al, 
Pediatric Rheumatology 8:20, 2010). Delayed diagnosis is a significant 
determinant of severity and mortality attributed to these conditions (Foster HE, 
Eltringham MS, Kay LJ, et al, Arthritis Care Res 57(6):921-7, 2007). pGALS is a 
simple clinical tool used to assess joints and identify musculoskeletal (MSK) 
conditions in school-going children to enable early referral to paediatric 
rheumatologists.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to translate and determine the diagnostic accuracy 
and acceptability of a Kiswahili version of the pGALS screening tool among 
Kiswahili-speaking children.
METHODS: The pGALS screening questions were translated into Kiswahili according 
to the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard for translation of a tool. The 
validity of the Kiswahili PGALS was ascertained and acceptability rated (time 
taken, discomfort). Using systematic random sampling, we enrolled children aged 
5-16 years presenting at the Aga Khan University Hospital's (AKUH) emergency 
department in Kenya, who spoke Kiswahili and had symptoms suggestive of an MSK 
condition. Those already under follow-up at the paediatric rheumatology service 
at AKUH were excluded. MSK assessment was undertaken by two resident doctors 
using the newly translated Kiswahili-pGALS and findings were compared with a 
paediatric rheumatologist examination ('gold-standard') on the same day, and who 
was blinded to the pGALS findings. We analysed demographic details of the 
participants and determined the diagnostic accuracy by cross tabulation of the 
index test results by the results of the reference standard.
RESULTS: One hundred children with a median age of nine years (IQR 7-11) were 
enrolled. The sensitivity and specificity of the Kiswahili-pGALS screening tool 
were 76.8% (95%CI 63.6-87.0%) and 40.0% (95%CI 23.9-57.9%), respectively. The 
diagnostic accuracy was 62.7% (95%CI 52.1-72.1%), area under the ROC was 0.58 
(95%CI 0.48-0.68). The median time to perform the Kiswahili-pGALS was 5.0 min 
(IQR 3.5-6.0 min). Ninety percent of the guardians found the practice of 
Kiswahili-pGALS to have none, or only some discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: The Kiswahili-pGALS's was found to be a useful screening tool to 
aid early identification of MSK conditions in Kiswahili-speaking settings. 
However, the low specificity implies that relatively large number of false 
positives would still need to be reviewed by a rheumatologist if the tool is 
adapted for use.

Intra-articular ganglion cysts of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are rare, 
and bilateral ganglion cysts are even rarer. These cysts may cause intermittent 
or chronic nonspecific knee discomfort. Although three cases of bilateral 
ganglion cysts have been reported in the literature, the knees were not 
simultaneously affected in those cases. Herein, we report the case of a 
56-year-old woman who presented with simultaneous bilateral ganglion cysts of 
the ACL that were symptomatic. She was successfully treated with arthroscopic 
resection and debridement. We also present a brief review of the literature, 
highlighting the aetiology, diagnosis and management of ganglion cysts of the 
ACL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of simultaneous 
bilateral intra-articular ganglion cysts of the ACL.

Arthrodesis was performed to treat septic arthritis of the proximal 
interphalangeal joint of 8 horses. Records of the horses were reviewed to 
determine outcome and possible factors that influenced success or failure. All 
horses were female. Seven horses had 1 joint treated and 1 horse was treated for 
bilateral pelvic limb involvement. The duration of sepsis before surgery ranged 
from 1 to 66 days. Bone lysis and production was radiographically apparent in 7 
horses before surgery. Six horses had multiple bacterial organisms cultured from 
bone or synovial tissues; 2 horses had single isolates identified. After 
aggressive curettage, arthrodesis was accomplished with 3 parallel screws in 1 
horse, 2 divergent narrow dynamic compression plates in 3 horses, and a single 
broad dynamic compression plate in 4 horses. Casts were applied to all horses 
for 1 to 6 weeks. Four horses survived to successful brood mare status. Four 
horses were euthanized during hospitalization because of continued discomfort or 
complications of sepsis. Arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint 
affected with septic arthritis appears to be an acceptable alternative to 
euthanasia for some horses.

Risk factors for the development of heterotopic ossification after knee 
dislocation.

BACKGROUND: Results of treatment for acute knee dislocations and multiligament 
knee injuries may be influenced by a multitude of patient- and injury-related 
factors, including neurologic function, vascular status, ipsilateral fractures, 
and joint stability. The development of heterotopic ossification (HO) may 
nullify any benefits of reconstruction, because it can cause stiffness and 
discomfort. Identifying factors associated with HO after knee dislocation may 
help identify patients who might benefit from prophylaxis.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were (1) to identify specific 
risk factors for the development of HO in patients with knee dislocation; and 
(2) to elucidate the relationship between the presence of absence of HO and 
postoperative range of motion.
METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, we performed 101 multiligament reconstructions 
for patients with knee dislocations, of which 91 (90%) in 91 patients were 
available for followup at a minimum of 6 months (mean, 18 months; range, 6-44 
months), and were reviewed here. AP and lateral radiographs were reviewed for 
all patients and HO was classified according to the Mills and Tejwani 
classification system. This knee dislocation cohort was separated into two 
groups based on the presence or absence of HO for comparison. Using a 
significance level of p < 0.05 for factors in the univariate analyses, we 
identified potential variables for a multivariate logistic regression model to 
identify risk factors predicting development of HO in patients with 
multiligament knee injuries; multivariate analysis then was performed to 
mitigate the influence of potentially confounding variables. Thirty patients 
(34%) developed HO after multiligament knee injury in our series.
RESULTS: Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was the only independent 
predictor of HO that we identified (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 
1.2-34.6). Patients who developed HO were more likely to develop stiff knees and 
undergo surgery (50%; 15 of 30 patients) versus those without HO (12%; seven of 
58 patients) to attempt to restore functional range of motion (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: HO is a common complication after knee dislocation and can diminish 
range of motion and cause patients to undergo further surgery. Posterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction is an independent risk factor for the 
development of HO. Strategies to identify risk factors for, and safe prevention 
of, HO after multiple ligament injury and surgery should be investigated going 
forward.

PURPOSE: To determine return to soccer rates and soccer performance in a large 
cohort of competitive soccer players after hip arthroscopic surgery for the 
treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and to identify possible risk 
factors associated with not returning to soccer.
METHODS: An institutional hip preservation registry was retrospectively reviewed 
for patients identified as competitive soccer players who underwent primary hip 
arthroscopy for FAI performed between 2010 and 2017. Patient demographics and 
injury characteristics as well as clinical and radiographic findings were 
recorded. All patients were contacted for return to soccer information using a 
soccer-specific return to play questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was used to identify potential risk factors for not returning to 
soccer.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven competitive soccer players (119 hips) were included. 32 
players (37%) underwent simultaneous or staged bilateral hip arthroscopy. The 
mean age at surgery was 21.6 ± 7.0 years. Overall, 65 players (74.7%) returned 
to soccer, of which 43 players (49% of all included players) returned to 
pre-injury level of play or better. Most common reasons for not returning to 
soccer were pain or discomfort (50%) followed by fear of re-injury (31.8%). The 
mean time to return to soccer was 33.1 ± 26.3 weeks. Among 22 players who did 
not return to soccer, 14 (63.6%) reported satisfaction from surgery. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed female players (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.27; confidence interval [CI] = 0.083 to 0.872; p = 0.029) and older 
aged players (OR = 0.895; 95% CI = 0.832 to 0.963; p = 0.003) were less likely 
to return to soccer. Bilateral surgery was not found to be a risk factor.
CONCLUSION: Hip arthroscopic treatment for FAI in symptomatic competitive soccer 
players allowed three-quarters of them to return to soccer. Despite not 
returning to soccer, two-thirds of players who did not return to soccer were 
satisfied with their outcome. Female and older aged players were less likely to 
return to soccer. These data can better guide clinicians and soccer players with 
realistic expectations related to the arthroscopic management of symptomatic 
FAI.

Background and Objectives: Type V tibial tubercle avulsion fractures are 
extremely rare; therefore, information on them remains limited. Furthermore, 
although these fractures are intra-articular, to the best of our knowledge, 
there are no reports on their assessment via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
arthroscopy. Accordingly, this is the first report to describe the case of a 
patient undergoing detailed evaluation via MRI and arthroscopy. Case 
Presentation: A 13-year-old male adolescent athlete jumped while playing 
basketball, experienced discomfort and pain at the front of his knee, and fell 
down. He was transported to the emergency room by ambulance after he was unable 
to walk. The radiographic examination revealed a Type Ⅴ tibial tubercle avulsion 
fracture that was displaced. In addition, an MRI scan revealed a fracture line 
extending to the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); moreover, 
high MRI intensity and swelling due to ACL were observed, suggesting an ACL 
injury. On day 4 of the injury, open reduction and internal fixation were 
performed. Furthermore, 4 months after surgery, bone fusion was confirmed, and 
metal removal was performed. Simultaneously, an MRI scan obtained at the time of 
injury revealed findings suggestive of ACL injury; therefore, an arthroscopy was 
performed. Notably, no parenchymal ACL injury was observed, and the meniscus was 
intact. The patient returned to sports 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion: 
Type V tibial tubercle avulsion fractures are known to be extremely rare. Based 
on our report, we suggest that MRI should be performed without hesitation if 
intra-articular injury is suspected.

Recent advances in submarine rescue systems have allowed a transfer under 
pressure of crew members being rescued from a disabled submarine. The choice of 
a safe decompression procedure for pressurised rescuees has been previously 
discussed, but no schedule has been validated when the internal submarine 
pressure is significantly increased i.e. exceeding 2.8 bar absolute pressure. 
This study tested a saturation decompression procedure from hyperbaric exposures 
up to 6 bar, the maximum operating pressure of the NATO submarine rescue system. 
The objective was to investigate the incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) 
and clinical and spirometric indices of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Two groups 
were exposed to a Nitrogen-Oxygen atmosphere (pO2 = 0.5 bar) at either 5 bar 
(N = 14) or 6 bar (N = 12) for 12 h followed by 56 h 40 min resp. 60 h of 
decompression. When chamber pressure reached 2.5 bar, the subjects breathed 
oxygen intermittently, otherwise compressed air. Repeated clinical examinations, 
ultrasound monitoring of venous gas embolism and spirometry were performed 
during decompression. During exposures to 5 bar, 3 subjects had minor subjective 
symptoms i.e. sensation of joint discomfort, regressing spontaneously, and after 
surfacing 2 subjects also experienced joint discomfort disappearing without 
treatment. Only 3 subjects had detectable intravascular bubbles during 
decompression (low grades). No bubbles were detected after surfacing. About 40% 
of subjects felt chest tightness when inspiring deeply during the initial phase 
of decompression. Precordial burning sensations were reported during oxygen 
periods. During decompression, vital capacity decreased by about 8% and forced 
expiratory flow rates decreased significantly. After surfacing, changes in the 
peripheral airways were still noticed; Lung Diffusion for carbon monoxide was 
slightly reduced by 1% while vital capacity was normalized. The procedure did 
not result in serious symptoms of DCS or pulmonary oxygen toxicity and may be 
considered for use when the internal submarine pressure is significantly 
increased.

Safety, Feasibility, and Efficacy of an Eccentric Exercise Intervention in 
People with Multiple Sclerosis with Ankle Contractures.

Psarakis M, Lord SR, Hoang PD.

BACKGROUND: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the safety and 
feasibility of an eccentric exercise program for people with multiple sclerosis 
(MS) who have ankle contractures, ie, reduced ankle range of motion (ROM). 
Secondary aims were to explore the efficacy of this eccentric exercise on ankle 
joint ROM and functional mobility.
METHODS: Five adults with MS with ankle contractures (three women and two men; 
mean ± SD age, 50.8 ± 9.4; MS duration, 7.6 ± 5.6 years) completed two eccentric 
exercise training sessions (10-45 minutes) per week for 12 weeks. The training 
involved walking backward downhill on an inclined treadmill (gradient, 10°-14°) 
at a self-selected pace. The intervention was assessed for safety (adverse 
events), feasibility (recruitment rates, adherence rates, enjoyment levels, 
difficulty, and discomfort), and clinical outcomes, including passive/active 
ankle ROM and distance walked in 6 minutes.
RESULTS: There were no adverse events during or after the eccentric exercise 
training. There was a 100% adherence rate. All participants enjoyed the training 
and experienced low levels of muscle soreness/discomfort. The training program 
improved passive/active ankle ROM in all participants; however, improvements did 
not translate to improvements in walking for all participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Walking backward and downhill is a safe and feasible training 
modality for people with MS with ankle contractures. Clinical outcomes (greater 
passive/active ankle ROM) after this eccentric exercise training were evident. 
However, translation to clinically meaningful changes in walking function 
requires further examination.

BACKGROUND: Traditional medial malleolar osteotomy combined with autologous 
osteochondral transplantation (AOT) is mostly used in the treatment of 
osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs), but with high osteotomy and donor 
site complications. We hypothesis a new triplane medial malleolar osteotomy 
combined with AOT from non-weight-bearing area of the talus could be a promising 
choice for OLTs.
METHODS: We reviewed all the symptomatic OLTs patients who received AOT with 
triplane osteotomy of the medial malleolus between September 2015 and December 
2017 in our department. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 
patients (23 ankles), including 14 males and 9 females, were included in the 
study. The mean age was 35.6 years. The mean size of the lesion area was 
141.5 mm2. According Ferkel's classification, including 5 type I, 11 typeIIa and 
7 typeIIb. The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain during walking and the 
American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score were 
used for the pre- and postoperative evaluations. In addition, the incorporation 
of the grafts was assessed by computed tomography (CT).
RESULTS: All patients had a minimum follow-up of 22 months, with an average of 
37.1 months. The mean time from osteotomy to full weight-bearing activity was 
8.1 ± 2.3 weeks (range, 5-12 weeks). The mean VAS score improved from 5.6 ± 0.7 
preoperatively to 0.7 ± 1.0 postoperatively (P < 0.01). The AOFAS ankle-hindfoot 
score improved significantly in all domains (P < 0.01). Twenty-one patients 
returned to sport at their previous level, and 2 returned at a lower level 
compared with preinjury (mean return to play, 7.4 months). According to CT, the 
medial malleolus recovered in all patients, and the graft was incorporated well. 
One patient suffered from flexor hallucis longus tendon discomfort due to 
internal fixation screw irritation posteromedial to the ankle. The general 
complication rate was 4.3% (1/23).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that AOT combined with medial malleolus 
triplane osteotomy maybe a viable option for OLTs. Patients could perform 
weight-bearing exercise and return to sport as early as possible, with a lower 
rate of complications at the osteotomy site and donor site. However, the large 
sample well-designed prospective comparative studies are still needed.

BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing of tibial shaft fractures has been common 
practice for decades. Nevertheless, complications occur frequently, and 
subsequent surgery is often required. To improve our understanding on how we may 
improve trauma care for patients with tibial shaft fractures, this study 
systematically reviewed all currently available evidence to assess the incidence 
of complications and rate of re-operations following intramedullary nailing of 
traumatic tibial fractures.
METHODS: Trip Database, Medline, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched on 
September 7th, 2018. Searches were limited to English studies published after 
January 1st, 1998. Studies were included if authors included more than 50 
patients treated with intramedullary nailing for traumatic tibial fractures. 
Inclusion of studies and critical appraisal of the evidence was performed by two 
independent authors. Incidence of complications and rate of re-operations were 
reported with descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Fifty-one studies involving 8110 patients treated with intramedullary 
nailing for traumatic tibial fractures were included. Mean age of patients was 
37.5 years. The most frequent complication was anterior knee pain (23%), 
followed by non-union (11%). Eighteen percent of patients required at least one 
subsequent surgery. The most frequent indication of subsequent surgery was screw 
removal due to pain or discomfort (9%). Dynamization of the nail to promote 
union was reported in 8% of the cases. Nail revision and bone-grafting to 
promote union were applied in 4% and 2% respectively.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Patients treated with intramedullary nailing for tibial 
fractures need to be consented for high probability of adverse events as 
anterior knee pain, subsequent surgical procedures and bone healing problems are 
relatively common. However, based on current data it remains difficult to 
identify specifiers and determinants of an individual patient with specific 
fracture characteristics at risk for complications. Future studies should aim to 
establish patient specific risks models for complications and re-operations, 
such that clinicians can anticipate them and adjust and individualize treatment 
strategies.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic 
condition in children. The treatment of JIA is mainly by drug therapy, which 
includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Sulfasalazine is a DMARD that is 
used as the second-line of therapy. Although believed to have an effective and 
safe profile, it has side effects ranging from mild gastrointestinal discomfort 
to hematopoietic alterations. In this study, we present a case of JIA with 
sulfasalazine-induced bone marrow suppression in a five-year-old child, which is 
rarely reported within the pediatric age group across the literature.

BACKGROUND: Extensor apparatus rupture is a severe complication after knee 
arthroplasty, but there have not been many reports on how to perform knee 
arthroplasty after chronic patellar ligament rupture. We reported a case of 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a patient with severe osteoarthritis (OA) 
complicated by chronic patellar ligament rupture.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this case, a 67-year-old male patient suffered from 
patellar ligament rupture due to trauma more than 20 years ago and did not 
undergo any formal treatment. Physical examination revealed a small amount of 
fluid and extension lag, and the patella was displaced upward by approximately 
5.5 cm. The quadriceps were atrophic and weak. There was significant tenderness 
on the medial side of the left knee joint. Passive motion of the left knee joint 
ranged from full extension to 120° of flexion with discomfort during excessive 
flexion. Active flexion of the knee joint to 120°, and extensor lag was 
approximately 90°. We reconstructed the extensor apparatus through a quadriceps 
tendon V-Y quadricepsplasty and Krackow suture technique of the patellar 
ligament, and osteoarthritis was resolved with TKA. The visual analogue scale 
(VAS) score decreased from 5 points to 1 point after surgery. Six weeks later, 
the patient was able to walk normally without a walking stick, and the knee 
joint could stretch actively to approximately 30°. However, he had obvious 
extension lag. This problem improved 10 months after surgery. The AKS score 
increased from 35 to 95 10 months after surgery. The HSS score increased from 43 
to 93.
CONCLUSIONS: TKA and ligament reconstruction are options for the treatment of 
knee OA with chronic patellar ligament rupture. V-Y lengthening of the 
quadriceps femoris tendon after the Krackow suture technique of the patellar 
ligament with transpatellar tunnels may be a reasonable choice during TKA.

Population aging is associated with increasing numbers of geriatric trauma 
patients, and various studies have evaluated their short-term outcomes, 
assessment, and treatment. However, there is insufficient information regarding 
their long-term outcomes. This study evaluated the physical and nutritional 
statuses of geriatric patients after trauma-related hospitalization.Data 
regarding physical and nutritional status were obtained from the Korean National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI (2013-2015).A total of 21,069 
individuals participated in the survey, including 5650 geriatric individuals. 
After excluding individuals with missing data, 3731 cases were included in the 
analyses. The average age was 68 years, and most individuals were women 
(n = 2055, 55.08%). There were 94 patients had been hospitalized because of 
trauma. Trauma-related hospitalization among geriatric patients was 
significantly associated with reduced strength exercise (23.56% vs 12.99%, 
P = .043), activity limitations caused by joint pain (0.65% vs 3.31%, P = .028), 
self-care problems (8.00% vs 16.77%, P = .008), pain or discomfort (29.48% vs 
40.51%, P = .024), hypercholesterolemia (27.37% vs 39.36%, P = .037), and 
mastication discomfort (39.98% vs 57.85% P = .005). The adjusted analyses 
revealed that trauma-related hospitalization was independently associated with 
activity limitations caused by joint pain (odds ratio [OR]: 5.04, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.29-19.67, P = .020), self-care problems (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 
1.11-4.53, P = .025), pain or discomfort (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, 
P = .023), and mastication discomfort (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.22-3.46, 
P = .007).Medical staff should be aware that geriatric patients have relatively 
poor physical and nutritional statuses after trauma-related hospitalization, and 
manage these patients accordingly.

In this case report, a 75-year-old woman with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis 
completed nine weeks (27 sessions, nine supervised) of blood-flow restricted 
(BFR) walking exercise without any discomfort and a 100% training adherence. BFR 
walking was well tolerated by the patient and resulted in improvements in 
functional capacity: 30-sec. sit-to-stand, timed up and go, 40-m walk test, and 
stair climb test. However, no positive changes were noted for maximal knee 
extensor and knee flexor strength or in Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of local subcutaneous pedicled fat 
flap filling and separation of the synostosis area associated with radial 
shortening osteotomy and plate internal fixation for the treatment of congenital 
radioulnar synostosis.
METHODS: Between February 2014 and June 2018, 36 patients (41 sides) with 
congenital radioulnar synostosis were analyzed retrospectively, including 21 
males and 15 females, aged 2.5-4.5 years with an average of 3.1 years. The fixed 
pronation deformity of the forearm ranged from 30° to 90° with an average of 
71.6°, and the range of motion of the elbow flexion was 120°-135° with an 
average of 128.2°. According to the Cleary-Omer classification, there were 8 
sides of type Ⅱ, 17 sides of type Ⅲ, and 16 sides of type Ⅳ. All patients were 
treated by local subcutaneous pedicled fat flap filling and separation of the 
synostosis area associated with radial shortening osteotomy and plate internal 
fixation. The range of motion of the elbow, muscle strength, joint stability, 
and patient discomfort were evaluated by using the Broberg and Morrey elbow 
scoring system preoperatively and postoperatively. In addition, the ability for 
daily living of the affected limb was evaluated by using the Failla grading 
standard.
RESULTS: Radial nerve palsy occurred in 3 cases, and nerve function recovered at 
2-4 weeks after operation. All the 36 cases were followed up 6-52 months, with 
an average of 38 months. All osteotomy sites healed, the healing time was 5-12 
weeks (mean, 6.3 weeks), and the pedicled fat flap between the radius and ulna 
survived when the internal fixation was taken. At last follow-up, the flexion 
range of motion of elbow joint was not decreased, and the pronation and 
supination range of motion of forearm were improved. The elbow flexion range of 
motion was 125°-135° with an average of 132.4°. The pronation range of motion of 
forearm was 15°-45° with an average of 30.1°, and the supination range of motion 
of forearm was 10°-40° with an average of 22.6°. At last follow-up, the Broberg 
and Morrey elbow scores increased from the preoperative 85.6±1.0 to 91.8±1.8, 
showing significant difference ( t=25.593, P=0.000). Moreover, the results were 
good in 3 sides, fair in 9 sides, and poor in 29 sides according to the Failla 
grading standard before operation, with an excellent and good rate of 7.3%. At 
last follow-up, the results were excellent in 6 sides, good in 28 sides, and 
fair in 7 sides, with an excellent and good rate of 82.9%, showing significant 
difference when compared with preoperative value ( Z=-5.781, P=0.000).
CONCLUSION: The application of local subcutaneous pedicled fat flap filling and 
separation of the synostosis area associated with radial shortening osteotomy 
and plate internal fixation is an effective surgical method for the treatment of 
congenital radioulnar synostosis. It can restore the partial rotation function 
of the forearm and improve the quality of life of children.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus are 
rare and are expected to have a high incidence of avascular necrosis (AVN) due 
to the avascular nature of the capitellar bone fragment and limited soft tissue 
attachment. However, according to the literature published thus far, AVN is 
infrequently reported, and some studies suggest that it does not have a 
significant impact on clinical outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two female patients, one aged 72 and the other 70, presented 
with coronal shear fractures of distal humerus. Both patients were diagnosed 
with AVN of the capitellum 7 and 10 months after undergoing open reduction and 
internal fixation. One patient underwent hardware removal, while the other 
patient declined due to the absence of discomfort. However, at their final 
follow-up, both patients exhibited good clinical results.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The occurrence of AVN may be related to the severity of the 
initial injury, including posterior comminution. While some studies suggest that 
AVN of the capitellum may not affect clinical outcomes, hardware removal may be 
required in cases where there is intra-articular protrusion of the hardware.
CONCLUSION: Although AVN is a rare occurrence, even when it does occur, it may 
not significantly affect clinical outcomes. In this study, AVN may be associated 
with initial injury severity, and surgical treatment may make it possible to 
develop AVN. Moreover, considering the timing of the occurrence of AVN, it is 
believed that a close follow-up of more than one year will be required.

Bone and joint infections are rare in the neonatal period. They often present 
with pseudo paralysis of the affected limb due to pain and discomfort caused by 
movement. The existence of a concomitant neuropathy is a rare and insufficiently 
understood phenomenon with few cases described. The authors report the case of a 
7-week infant, born prematurely and with Staphylococcus aureus neonatal sepsis, 
who presented to the emergency room with a paretic right upper limb. 
Osteoarticular infection complicated with brachial plexus neuropathy was 
considered and MRI and electromyography the confirmed diagnosis. There was a 
good outcome after antibiotic treatment and functional rehabilitation.

Off-the-shelf hip joints are considered essential parts in rehabilitation 
medicine that can help the disabled. However, the failure of the materials used 
in such joints can cause individual discomfort. In support of the various motor 
conditions of the influenced individuals, the aim of the current research is to 
develop a new composite that can be used as an acetabular liner inside the hip 
joint. Polylactic acid (PLA) can provide the advantage of design flexibility 
owing to its well-known applicability as a 3D printed material. However, using 
PLA as an acetabular liner is subject to limitations concerning mechanical 
properties. We developed a complete production process of a natural filler, 
i.e., date pits. Then, the PLA and date pit particles were extruded for 
homogenous mixing, producing a composite filament that can be used in 3D 
printing. Date pit particles with loading fractions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 
wt.% are dispersed in the PLA. The thermal, physical, and mechanical properties 
of the PLA-date pit composites were estimated experimentally. The incorporation 
of date pit particles into PLA enhanced the compressive strength and stiffness 
but resulted in a reduction in the elongation and toughness. A finite element 
model (FEM) for hip joints was constructed, and the contact stresses on the 
surface of the acetabular liner were evaluated. The FEM results showed an 
enhancement in the composite load carrying capacity, in agreement with the 
experimental results.

We conducted an ambispective cohort study of 83 patients with a diagnosis of 
Lisfranc fracture dislocation from 1993 to 2008. The lesions were classified 
into two groups: pure dislocations and fracture dislocations of the Lisfranc 
joint using the Hardcastle-Reschamer classification. The results included the 
following data: sociodemographic and epidemiologic variables, lesion-related 
variables, clinical parameters, and the following clinical and functional 
assessment scales: Baltimore Painful Foot Score, Creighton-Nebraska Health 
Foundation, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), and Hannover 
Scoring System. Sixty-three patients were treated surgically. Closed reduction 
and minimally invasive fixation with Kirschner nails were performed in 53 
patients (63.9%), and open reduction with a dorsal approach and fixation with 
Kirschner nails in 10 cases (15.2%). In 46 cases de medial column was fixed, in 
61 cases the intermediate column, and in 42 the lateral column. Sixty-six 
(79.5%) of the patients had complications including both acute and late ones. 
Regardless of the technique used, the purpose of treatment was the anatomical 
reduction of the involved joints. Based on our experience, we think that the use 
of Kirschner nails is effective, as it provides enough stiffness and stability. 
In general terms, this injury is not as disabling as it had been considered in 
the literature. Patients consider their discomfort as tolerable and compatible 
with the demands of their activities of daily living and they may perform their 
work considering the time limitations.

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the optimal objective function weightings change 
when using a digital human model (DHM) to predict origin and destination lifting 
postures under unfatigued and fatigued states.
BACKGROUND: The ability to predict human postures can depend on state-based 
influences (e.g., fatigue). Altering objective function weightings within a 
predictive DHM could improve the ability to predict tasks specific lifting 
postures under unique fatigue states.
METHOD: A multi-objective optimization-based DHM was used to predict origin and 
destination lifting postures for ten anthropometrically scaled avatars by using 
different objective functions weighting combinations. Predicted and measured 
postures were compared to determine the root mean squared error. A response 
surface methodology was used to identify the optimal objective function 
weightings, which was found by generating the posture that minimized error 
between measured and predicted lifting postures. The resultant weightings were 
compared to determine if the optimal objective function weightings changed for 
different lifting postures or fatigue states.
RESULTS: Discomfort and total joint torque weightings were affected by posture 
(origin/destination) and fatigue state (unfatigued/fatigued); however, post-hoc 
differences between fatigue states and lifting postures were not sufficiently 
large to be detected. Weighting the discomfort objective function alone tended 
to predict postures that generalized well to both postures and fatigue states.
CONCLUSION: Lift postures were optimal predicted using the minimization of 
discomfort objective function regardless of fatigue state.
APPLICATION: Weighting the discomfort objective can predict unfatigued postures, 
but more research is needed to understand the optimal objective function 
weightings to predict postures during a fatigued state.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of arthroscopic anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) reconstruction via transtibial (TT) and transportal (TP) 
techniques after 10 years follow-up.
METHODS: A clinical data of 103 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL 
reconstruction with a single bundle of autologous hamstring tendon between March 
2006 and March 2009 was retrospectively analyzed, among which 57 patients were 
reconstructed with TT technique (TT group) and 46 patients were reconstructed 
with TP technique (TP group). There was no significant difference in gender, 
age, cause of injury, interval between injury and operation, preoperative pivot 
shift test, preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 
score, Lysholm score, and KT-2000 side-to-side difference (SSD) between the two 
groups ( P>0.05). At 10 years after operation, Lachman test was used to evaluate 
the forward joint stability and pivot shift test to evaluate the rotational 
stability of the knee; KT-2000 SSD was used to measure tibial anterior 
displacement; IKDC score and Lysholm score were used to evaluate knee function; 
MRI examination was performed to observe graft healing and measure coronal 
inclination angles of the tibia and femoral tunnels. The rate of return to 
sports was also calculated.
RESULTS: The incisions healed by first intention in the two groups, and no early 
complication occurred after operation. All patients were followed up 10-13 
years, with an average of 11.5 years. During the follow-up period, there was no 
limitation of knee extension and flexion, no discomfort of donor site or graft 
failure in either group. MRI examination showed that the graft healed well. The 
IKDC score, Lysholm score, and KT-2000 SSD in the two groups were significantly 
improved after 10 years ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference 
between the two groups at 10 years after operation ( P>0.05). There were 
significant differences in coronal inclination angles of femoral tunnel and 
tibial tunnel between the two groups ( P<0.05). There was no significant 
difference in Lachman test and pivot shift test between the two groups ( 
P>0.05). The rate of return to sports of patients was 61.40% (35/57) in TT group 
and 63.04% (29/46) in TP group, showing no significant difference between the 
two groups ( χ 2=0.29, P=0.87).
CONCLUSION: TT and TP techniques can both achieve good effectiveness in ACL 
reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the long-term 
results of revision ORIF, joint contracture release, and autogenous 
bone-grafting in the treatment of distal humerus frac-ture nonunions in older 
aged patients with poor bone quality or bone loss who would have been candidates 
for total elbow arthroplasty.
METHODS: Seven patients (average age at index procedure: 53.3 years, range: 
41-75) with a distal humerus fracture nonunion treated with revision ORIF, joint 
contracture release and autogenous bone grafting between 1989-2000 were 
available for follow-up. Radiographic union and arthrosis were assessed using 
the most recent radiograph. Pain-related outcomes were measured using PROMIS 
Pain Interference scores. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Mayo 
Elbow Perfor-mance Index (MEPI).
RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 22 years (range: 19-27 years), all 
nonunions were healed after the index procedure and had an average arc of 
ulnohumeral motion of 80°, flexion of 112°, and flex-ion contracture of 32°. 
Average arthrosis grade was moderate joint-space narrowing with osteo-phyte 
formation. One patient had exertional discomfort but none required chronic pain 
medica-tions. PROMIS-Pain Interference scores were no different than the general 
population (mean [95%CI] = 49.2 [41.8, 56.6], p =0.83). Per the MEPI, the 
functional result was excellent in five patients, good in one, and poor in one.
CONCLUSION: Despite older age and worse bone quality, distal humerus fracture 
nonunions can be treated using revision ORIF, joint contracture release and 
autogenous bone-grafting with acceptable long-term outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Tension band wiring is considered the standard treatment for 
transverse olecranon fractures. Its main complications are pin migration and 
discomfort caused by the hardware. We have designed and used "expulsion-proof" 
pins (EPP) that are shaped to prevent migration and reduce discomfort. This 
study compared the complication rate between our device and Kirschner pins 
(controls).
HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesised that EPP would have lower migration rates and fewer 
complications than standard Kirschner pins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, multi-operator, 
observational, study examined data from January 1996 to December 2014. The 
primary outcome was the occurrence of pin migration. Secondary outcomes were the 
occurrence of one or more additional complications and the hardware removal 
rate.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 101 patients: 53 (52.4%) with expulsion-proof pins 
and 48 (47.6%) controls. The mean follow-up was 240.6days in the EPP group and 
268.9days in the control group. No cases of migration (0%) were found in the EPP 
group versus 21 (43.7%) cases in the controls (p<0.05). One or more 
complications occurred in 18 (33.9%) patients in the EPP group versus 46 (95.8%) 
controls (p<0.05). There was material discomfort in 13 (24.5%) cases and 1 
(1.9%) case of secondary displacement in the EPP group, compared with 38 (79.2%) 
and 7 (14.6%) cases, respectively, in the controls (p<0.05). The rate of delayed 
consolidation was statistically identical in the two groups (p=0.103). The 
hardware was removed in 13 (24.5%) cases in the EPP group compared with 36 (75%) 
controls (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: EPPs are useful for management of olecranon fractures treated via 
TBW: the pins do not migrate and can reduce complications, discomfort, secondary 
displacement, and the hardware removal rate.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

PURPOSE: The Elson technique is a rigid reconstruction method for a hypoplastic 
or absent sagittal band in the treatment of chronic extensor digitorum communis 
(EDC) tendon dislocation. We performed a modified procedure based on the Elson 
technique for reconstruction of the radial sagittal band in case involving the 
index finger. We investigated the postoperative outcomes of chronic EDC 
dislocation after treatment with the original and modified Elson technique.
METHODS: We examined five fingers of five patients (2 males and 3 females) with 
a mean age of 41 years. The chronic EDC tendon dislocation was due to an old 
trauma, or a spontaneous or congenital condition involving the index in two, 
middle in two, and ring finger in one patient. Sagittal band reconstruction was 
performed using the modified Elson technique for the index finger and the 
original technique for the other fingers. The mean duration of postoperative 
follow-up was 58 months. Clinical findings such as pain and discomfort at 
metacarpophalangeal flexion associated with the tendon dislocation, range of 
motion (ROM), and disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand were evaluated. We 
also examined postoperative recurrence and subjective patient evaluation.
RESULTS: All cases achieved pain-free stability of the EDC tendon with no 
recurrence, and full ROM was maintained at the latest examination after surgery. 
The postoperative subjective evaluation by the patients was "very satisfied" in 
four fingers and "neutral" in one finger.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated our modified Elson technique for the treatment of 
chronic extensor tendon dislocation of the index finger.

OBJECTIVE: To describe an in vivo model in the rat in which change in weight 
distribution is used as a measure of disease progression and efficacy of 
acetaminophen and two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in a model 
of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: Intra-articular injections of MIA and saline were administered to male 
Wistar rats (175-200 g) into the right and left knee joints, respectively. 
Changes in hind paw weight distribution between the right (osteoarthritic) and 
left (contralateral control) limbs were utilized as an index of joint 
discomfort. Acetaminophen and two archetypal, orally administered NSAIDs, 
naproxen and rofecoxib, were examined for their ability to decrease MIA-induced 
change in weight distribution.
RESULTS: A concentration-dependent increase in change in hind paw weight 
distribution was noted after intra-articular injection of MIA. Both naproxen and 
rofecoxib demonstrated the capacity to significantly (P<0.05) decrease hind paw 
weight distribution in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating that the change in 
weight distribution associated with MIA injection is susceptible to 
pharmacological intervention.
CONCLUSION: The determination of differences in hind paw weight distribution in 
the rat MIA model of OA is a technically straightforward, reproducible method 
that is predictive of the effects of anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. 
This system may be useful for the discovery of novel pharmacologic agents in 
human OA.

INTRODUCTION: Scapular winging is a pathological condition that occurs due to 
dysfunction of any scapulothoracic muscles, most commonly the serratus anterior 
which is innervated by long thoracic nerve.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a 10-year-old boy presented with bilateral 
scapular winging for a few months, associated with vague discomfort upon 
shoulder movements. After taking history and performing physical examination and 
tests as electromyography, he was diagnosed with idiopathic bilateral scapular 
winging as there was no obvious cause or risk factor for his bilateral scapular 
winging.
DISCUSSION: Scapular winging causes decrease strength and range of motion of the 
shoulder, the usual complain of patients is discomfort or the unpleasant 
cosmetic appearance of scapular prominence, this condition, if left untreated, 
can cause various negative consequences on the shoulder joint, detailed history 
and physical exam reinforced by electromyography are crucial in determining the 
cause of winging, as it has many causes, initial management can be conservative, 
but various surgical approaches have been described for more severe cases which 
compromise shoulder function, choice of the surgical approach depends on the 
underlying cause and overall clinical picture of the patient.
CONCLUSION: bilateral scapular winging is rare condition, only 26th cases were 
reported in literature, it occurs due to multiple causes, treatment can be 
conservative at early stages, but surgical option should be considered when 
shoulder function and strength become compromised.

Pain of the tempro-mandibular joint (TMJ) has a direct bearing to missing teeth 
and excessive physical activity. Consumption of qat requires chewing on the 
leaves to extract their juice for long hours. A 65-year-old male Yemeni patient, 
a Qat chewer, reported to the university dental hospital at King Khalid 
University complaining of pain in left temporomandibular joint with missing 
mandibular anterior teeth. A multidisciplinary approach for the overall 
treatment of the patient was decided. Initial treatment was the relief of 
patient's pain with the help of a night guard. This was followed by a 
fabrication of anterior FPD. The case was under maintenance and follow-up 
protocol for a period of 8 months with no complaint of pain discomfort.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate short-term effectiveness of revision total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) with porous-coated metaphyseal Sleeve and MBT implant.
METHODS: A clinical data of 23 patients (24 knees) who underwent revision TKA by 
using porous-coated metaphyseal Sleeve combined with MBT implant between March 
2015 and April 2017 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 8 males (8 knees) 
and 15 females (16 knees). The age ranged from 48 to 85 years (mean, 65.4 
years). The cause of revision TKA included infection in 14 knees, aseptic 
loosening in 8 knees, instability in 1 knee, and stiff knee in 1 knee. Bone 
defects were classified according to the Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute 
(AORI) bone defect classification. The femoral defect was rated as type ⅡA in 5 
knees, type ⅡB in 17 knees, and type Ⅲ in 2 knees; the tibial defect was rated 
as type ⅡA in 2 knees, type ⅡB in 20 knees, and type Ⅲ in 2 knees. The mean time 
between primary TKA and revision TKA was 30.6 months (range, 6-86 months). The 
preoperative range of motion (ROM) was (56.0±24.9)°. The preoperative Hospital 
for Special Surgery (HSS) total score was 41.9±14.2; and the pain and function 
scores were 8.5±5.2 and 33.4±13.5, respectively.
RESULTS: All patients were followed up 12-39 months (mean, 25.6 months). The 
mean operation time was 2.2 hours (range, 1.6-2.9 hours). The mean 
intraoperative blood loss was 580 mL (range, 400-1 000 mL). There were 2 knees 
(8.3%) of intraoperative fracture associated with Sleeve insertion and 1 knee 
(4.2%) of acute postoperative infection at 25 days after revision TKA. All 
incisions healed by first intention. No deep venous thrombosis of lower 
extremity occurred. X-ray film showed that all implants were stable. At last 
follow-up, slight discomfort after exercise occurred in 4 knees (16.7%); 
end-of-stem pain in the tibia occurred in 1 knee (4.2%). The ROM was 
(114.6±5.1)°, which had significant improvement compared with the preoperative 
result ( t=11.698， P=0.000). The HSS total score (89.0±10.9), pain score 
(26.9±6.6), and function score (62.1±5.8) also had significant improvement 
compared with the preoperative results ( t=15.616, P=0.000; t=12.522, P=0.000; 
t=10.076, P=0.000).
CONCLUSION: The porous-coated metaphyseal Sleeve combined with MBT implant in 
revision TKA has a significant improvement in short-term effectiveness and no 
signs of implant loosening.

Multimodal cocktail periarticular injections comprising corticosteroids are the 
most suggested therapy for postoperative discomfort and swelling following total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA). Nevertheless, previous findings cannot be applied to 
instances of unilateral total knee arthroplasty on bilateral knees. This 
randomized, prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical study examines the 
efficacy as well as safety of periarticular multimodal cocktail injection along 
or sans corticosteroids in certain situations. The 60 patients (120 knees) that 
experienced concurrent bilateral total knee arthroplasty were provided 
periarticular injections along additional betamethasone (7 mg) in the randomized 
knee, as well as the other knee, where corticosteroid was not administered. Key 
results were "pain scores at rest as well as in action" on a visual analogue 
scale of 11 pt. Other results included motion range, swelling of the thigh, 
Hospital for Special Surgery score (HSS score), and adverse effects were 
measured between the two sides. No statistically promising variations were found 
in the visual analogue scale ranking, motion range, girth of the thigh, and HSS 
score, as well as complications between the two sides. The impact on treatment 
outcomes was maintained between the knees on postoperative day 3 or at 3 months 
of follow-up. Multimodal periarticular injection without corticosteroid will 
alleviate postoperative swelling and pain. More studies are needed for the use 
of betamethasone as a corticosteroid in periarticular multimodal cocktail 
injections. This Chinese Clinical Trial Registry is registered with

Obesity (sthoulya), in general, is a significant health problem and is 
associated with several comorbidities and various discomforts that can cause 
negative impact on physical, mental, and social well-being of a person. In this 
case study, an obese patient was suffering from severe multiple joint pains (aam 
vata) and shortness of breath (shwaas) was unable to climb stairs, and had 
extreme difficulty in walking. The patient also suffered from stress-related 
complaints, such as sleep disturbances (anidra) and poor digestion. The 
treatment was aimed at restoring psycho-physiological and physical health of the 
patient. Ayurveda panchakarma therapy involves treatments such as snehana 
(oleation), svedana (sudation), and virechana (purgation), which are the line of 
treatment for obesity-related disorders. Furthermore, the patient was given 
special yoga postures to improve flexibility and movement of joints. The 
integrative therapy of Ayurveda panchakarma and yoga showed significant 
improvement in functional capacity, quality of life, and musculoskeletal pain.

The challenge of osteoarthritis (OA) is to find a minimally invasive 
orthobiological therapy to contrast OA progression, on inflammatory and 
structural fronts. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of an 
intra-articular injection of three orthobiological treatments, autologous 
culture expanded adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs), autologous 
stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and allogenic culture expanded amniotic 
epithelial stem cells (AECs), in an animal model of OA. OA was induced in 24 
sheep by bilateral lateral meniscectomy and, at 3 and 6 months post-treatment, 
the results were analyzed with macroscopy, histology, histomorphometry, and 
biochemistry. All the three treatments showed better results than control 
(injection of NaCl), but SVF and AECs showed superiority over ADSCs, because 
they induced higher cartilage regeneration and lower inflammation. SVF showed 
better results than AECs at 3 and 6 months. To conclude, SVF seems to be more 
favorable than the other biological options, because it is easily obtained and 
rapidly used after harvesting, with good healing potential. AECs cause no 
discomfort and could be also considered for the treatment of OA joints.

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Oral parafunctional activity can be fatigued and painful 
masticatory muscles and/or pain in the temporomandibular joints. There is 
controversial discussion in the literature as to what role parafunctional 
activity plays in the multi-causal pathologic process.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine any association between the 
level of parafunctional habits versus the level of mandibular dysfunction and to 
test the hypothesis that TMD/bruxer patients have significantly increased muscle 
tension and joint pain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 307 subjects (140 males und 167 females) 
selected for this investigation. 299 subjects were examined regarding any 
relationships between clenching and the incidence of muscle sensitivity. The age 
of subjects ranged from 20 to 54 years old, with a mean age of 35.4. 114 
subjects had at least one sign of temporomandibular disorders (tenderness/pain 
on palpation of the joints or muscles, TMJ sounds, pain or deviation during 
maximum mouth opening (active/passive).
RESULTS: 81 subjects admitted to clenching, while 218 said they did not. Among 
the "non-clenchers", 68.8% had no sensitive muscles, 31.2% indicated sensitive 
masticatory muscles. Those who clenched their teeth were distributed as follows: 
53.1% were diagnosed with bilateral masticatory muscle sensitivity, 46.9% showed 
no such indications. The two groups were not homogeneously divided, with regard 
to pain/discomfort (p = 0.001; Fisher's precision test).
CONCLUSION: This study found a statistically solid relationship between the 
incidence of "clenching" and muscle palpation findings, as well as between 
sensitivity in the mandibular joints from lateral and to cranial and dorsal with 
positive muscle palpation findings. The agreement between sensitivity of the 
masticatory musculature and the mandibular joint demonstrates that intensive 
clenching can predominantly lead to pathologic phenomena in the muscles or 
joints.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate intra-articular autologous protein solution (APS) for the 
treatment of osteoarthritis in horses. Animals-40 client-owned horses with 
naturally occuring osteoarthritis.
PROCEDURES: APS was generated from a dual-device system that concentrated plasma 
and WBC proteins and enriched platelet growth factors. Horses were randomly 
assigned to receive an intra-articular injection of 5 mL of saline (0.9% NaCl) 
solution (n = 20) or APS (20), exercised on a treadmill, and evaluated on the 
basis of lameness grades, kinetic gait analysis, joint circumference, and range 
of motion for 14 days. Horses that received saline solution were administered 
APS at termination of the study, and clients scored horses for lameness and 
discomfort before, 12 weeks after, and 52 weeks after the APS injection.
RESULTS: The APS group had significant improvements in lameness grade, asymmetry 
indices of vertical peak force, and range of joint motion by 14 days, compared 
with baseline or control group values. No adverse effects associated with APS 
treatment were evident. Clients assessed lameness and comfort as improved at 12 
and 52 weeks. The APS had greater likelihood (OR, 4.3 to 30.0) of a therapeutic 
response in horses with a lameness score < 4, < 10% vertical force asymmetry, or 
absence of marked osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, or joint space 
narrowing. Concentration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in APS was 5.8 
times that in blood.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intra-articular administration of APS can be 
considered an effective treatment option for equine osteoarthritis, with the 
potential for disease-modifying effects.

BACKGROUND: Pain, a common symptom of hemophilia, begins early in life primarily 
due to joint bleeding. Recurrent bleeding adversely affects patients' 
pain-related physical functioning, which can negatively impact their quality of 
life (QoL).
OBJECTIVE: Post hoc analysis of data from the A-LONG study (NCT01181128), to 
assess change over time in pain-related QoL in patients with severe hemophilia A 
treated prophylactically with recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein 
(rFVIIIFc).
METHODS: Patients who completed Haem-A-QoL (17-65 years) and EQ-5D-3L 
(⩾12-65 years) questionnaires at baseline (BL) and end of study (EoS). 
Individual-level changes were assessed using three pain-related items of the 
Haem-A-QoL 'Physical Health' domain and the pain/discomfort item of EQ-5D-3L. 
Distributions of responses (EoS versus BL) were compared using McNemar's test.
RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of patients reported they did not 
experience painful swellings (n = 87; 66% versus 46%, p < 0.01) or pain in their 
joints (n = 89; 42% versus 27%; p < 0.05) at EoS versus BL. The proportion of 
patients who did not find it painful to move numerically increased at EoS versus 
BL (n = 86; 47% versus 38%; p = NS). A significantly greater proportion of 
patients reported no pain/discomfort at EoS versus BL (n = 116; 45% versus 34%; 
p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study reports the effect of FVIII prophylaxis on 
patient-reported measures of pain over time in patients with severe hemophilia 
A. The results of this post hoc analysis showed improvements in pain from BL to 
EoS in patients receiving rFVIIIFc individualized prophylaxis indicating 
effective pain management, a key component of patient care.

BACKGROUND: MRI is predictive of adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) after 
THA but how MRI directly relates to implant surface wear, fretting, and trunnion 
corrosion at different articulations between implant components remains unclear. 
MRI generates high-contrast images to display soft tissues around arthroplasty 
and may provide a surgeon the means to distinguish and differentiate 
host-related synovial patterns as a response to either polyethylene wear or 
metal wear and corrosion products.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were (1) to correlate findings 
from MRI in patients who have undergone THA with direct assessment of implant 
wear, corrosion, and fretting from retrieved components; and (2) to distinguish 
the unique synovial responses on MRI in patients who have undergone THA based on 
bearing materials.
METHODS: In this prospective study, patients undergoing THA (181 patients, 187 
hips) with metal-on-metal (MoM), hip resurfacing (HRA), metal-on-polyethylene 
(MoP), ceramic-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-ceramic, or modular neck designs 
having revision surgery (between October 2013 and June 2017) underwent 
preoperative MRI. A single reader blinded to the bearing surface made an 
assessment of the synovial response (Gwet's AC1, 0.65-0.97); these data were 
compared with semiquantitative histology of tissue samples by a single reader 
(Gwet's AC1, 0.92) and semiquantitative wear, corrosion, and fretting analysis 
of retrieved components using Goldberg scoring (Gwet's AC1, 0.60-0.79). Direct 
noncontact measurements of implant wear were also made. Correlations and 
analyses of variance were used to assess associations between metrics and 
differences by implant type, respectively.
RESULTS: Correlations were found between MRI synovial thickness with severity of 
fretting and corrosion damage of the female head-neck trunnion of femoral stems 
in modular designs (ρ = 0.26 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.12-0.39]; p = 
0.015, n = 185) and ALTR grade and volumetric wear in MoM bearings (ρ = 0.93 
[95% CI, 0.72-0.98]; p < 0.001, n = 10). MRI synovial thickness was highest in 
patients identified with aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated 
lesions and diffuse tissue necrosis. On MRI, MoP hips demonstrated a distinct 
polymeric synovial response, whereas HRA, MoM, and modular hips more commonly 
demonstrated ALTR. Hips classified as having a polymeric synovial response on 
MRI had a greater number of particles present in tissue samples.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that MRI of THA can distinguish 
synovial responses that reflect the bearing type of the implanted THA and 
correlate to direct measurements of implant wear, corrosion, and fretting and 
histologic assessment of wear particles in periprosthetic tissues. MRI provides 
a means of direct, noninvasive visualization of the host-generated synovial 
response. Patients presenting with painful arthroplasties may be evaluated for 
the cause of their discomfort, specifically highlighting any concerning synovial 
reactions that would warrant more prompt surgical intervention. Future studies 
would benefit from a prospective evaluation of different implants to assess the 
natural longitudinal history of arthroplasty complications, including the 
development and prevalence of ALTR across bearing constructs.

Background: In hip arthroplasties, surgeons rely on their experience to assess 
the stability and balance of hip tissues when fitting the implant to their 
patients. During the operation, surgeons use a modular, temporary set of 
implants to feel the tension in the surrounding soft tissues and adjust the 
implant configuration. This process is naturally subjective and therefore 
depends on the operator. Inexperienced surgeons undertaking hip arthroplasties 
are twice as likely to experience errors than their experienced colleagues, 
leading to dislocations, pain and discomfort for the patients. Methods: To 
address this issue, a new, 3DOF force measurement system was developed and 
integrated into the modular, trial implants that can quantify forces and 
movements intraoperatively in 3D. The prototypes were evaluated in three 
post-mortem human specimens (PMHSs), to provide surgeons with objective data to 
help determine the optimal implant fit and configuration. The devices comprise a 
deformable polymer material providing strain-based displacements measured with 
electromagnetic-based sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for motion 
data. Results: Device results show a relative accuracy of approx. 2% and a 
sensitivity of approx. 1%. PMHS results indicated that soft tissue forces on the 
hip joint peak in the order of ~100 N and trend with positions of the leg during 
range of motion (ROM) tests, although force patterns differ between each PMHS. 
Conclusion: By monitoring forces and force patterns of hip soft tissues, in 
combination with standardised ROM tests, the force patterns could shed a light 
on potential anomalies that can be addressed during surgery. Clinical and 
Translational Impact Statement: The development of an instrumented hip implant 
device for use during surgery knowledge will eventually allow us to develop a 
predictive model for soft tissue balancing, that can be used for pre- and 
intra-operative planning for each patient on a tailored and personalised basis. 
Ultimately, we hope that with this device, patients will benefit from a faster 
recovery, from a more-precisely fitted hip, and an improved quality of life.

Although synovial plicae of the knee are frequently observed in adults and often 
bilateral, they remain, in most cases, asymptomatic. Pain is thus the most 
commonly encountered symptom. We report the case of an unusual complete 
suprapatellar plica of pseudotumoral aspect. Suprapatellar plicae account for 58 
to 87% of all plicae of the knee and mostly remain asymptomatic except in case 
of a complete septum. A 17-year-old male presented with complaints of his right 
knee with local discomfort for more than one-year duration. The pain mostly 
arose following a prolonged sitting position but with no significant pain in the 
knee otherwise. The presence of an anterolateral suprapatellar mass at clinical 
examination required the need for further tests (standard X-rays and MRI). On MR 
imaging, the liquid aspect of this mass associated with a complete suprapatellar 
bandlike structure separating the sub-quadricipital recess from the knee joint 
suggested the diagnosis of a complete septum type of suprapatellar plica. 
Treatment consisted in an arthroscopic resection. Anatomopathologic verification 
of the removed tissues confirmed the benignant nature of this resected material.

Total hip replacement in inflammatory hip disease using the Charnley prosthesis.

Harris J, Lightowler CD, Todd RC.

The Charnley low-friction arthroplasty was performed on 73 hips in 55 patients 
with inflammatory joint disease, usually for intolerable pain. Sixty-five of 
these operations were reviewed at a special clinic or by postal questionnaire; 
57 hips were painfree or gave rise to only occasional discomfort, in 58 there 
was an increased range of movement, and in 46 of the 59 hips assessed 
clinically, the results were excellent or good. The most serious complication 
was deep infection, which occurred in 7 operations.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed whether an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) 
protocol could be beneficial for children with distal humerus fractures.
METHODS: Children with distal humerus fractures (n = 85) were randomly assigned 
to the ERAS and control groups and subjected to different perioperative 
managements. This was followed by the evaluation of their intraoperative 
characteristics (operation time and bleeding), postoperative characteristics 
(food intake conditions, pain scores, and discharge time), and postoperative 
functions.
RESULTS: The operation time, intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative 
hematological indices did not differ significantly between the two groups. 
Preoperative thirst and hunger were considerably less and the initial food 
intake duration following surgery was markedly shorter in the ERAS group than in 
the control group, whereas no difference between the groups was observed in the 
incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting. A markedly reduced highest 
postoperative pain score and reduced mean pain score and demand for additional 
analgesic interventions were observed in the ERAS group compared with those in 
the control group, although the differences were not statistically significant. 
No noticeable between-group differences were observed in the incidences of 
postoperative incision problems, aspirational pneumonia, and gastroesophageal 
reflux. The total length of hospital stay was not significantly different 
between the two groups. However, the length of postoperative hospital stay was 
remarkably shorter and the elbow joint function at 2 months after surgery was 
significantly improved in the ERAS group compared with those in the control 
group.
CONCLUSION: The ERAS protocol can ameliorate preoperative discomfort and 
postoperative pain, shorten the postoperative hospital stay, and accelerate 
postoperative functional recovery without increasing the risks of postoperative 
nausea, vomiting, and poor incision healing and is, therefore, worthy of 
clinical application.

OBJECTIVE: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) comprise a cluster of conditions 
with a wide range of etiological factors that causes pain and discomfort in the 
masticatory muscles (TMD-M) and temporomandibular joints (TMD-J). More than 50% 
of the patients with TMD report regular usage of drugs. However, there is still 
no consensus, nor is there any evidence-based support for clinicians when 
choosing between different drugs. Therefore, this systematic review, including a 
network meta-analysis (NMA), aimed to evaluate the scientific evidence and 
discuss the pharmacological treatment options available to treat painful TMD.
METHOD: An electronic search was undertaken to identify randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) investigating pharmacological treatments for TMD-M and/or TMD-J, 
published until 6 April 2023. Since only 11 articles could be used for an NMA 
regarding TMD-M, a narrative synthesis was also performed for all 40 included 
RCTs. The quality of evidence was rated according to Cochrane's tool for 
assessing risk of bias, while the certainty of evidence was rated according to 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).
RESULTS: When it comes to TMD-M, evidence arises for wet needling therapies with 
BTX-A, granisetron, and PRP as well as muscle relaxants. For TMD-J, evidence 
points toward pharmacological treatment approaches including non-steroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticosteriods (for inflammatory 
conditions) as well as hyaluronic acid and dextrose.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence clearly indicates that the pharmacological treatment 
approaches differ between TMD-M and TMD-J. Therefore, it is of great importance 
to first try to uncover each patient's individual and multifactorial etiology 
and then employ a multifaceted treatment strategy, including pharmacological 
treatment approaches.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with 
hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and shoulder complaints with or without 
mechanical symptoms, and to compare characteristics between these groups.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred patients with HSD and shoulder complaints for at least 
3 months were included from primary care (N=100).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical history, self-reported (shoulder pain and 
function, discomfort due to other symptoms, fatigue, fear of movement, quality 
of life) and objective (strength, range of motion, proprioception) 
characteristics were collected by physiotherapists. Mechanical symptoms (yes/no) 
were defined as self-reported shoulder instability, subluxation, and/or laxity.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven reported mechanical symptoms. Patients in both groups 
reported impairments related to shoulder pain, function, fatigue, fear of 
movement, and quality of life. Patients with mechanical symptoms were younger 
(mean, 35.1 years [95% CI, 32.3-37.9 years] vs 43.3 years [95% CI, 38.4-48.1 
years]), had longer symptom duration (median, 46 months [95% CI, 36-66 months] 
vs 24 months [95% CI, 9-56 months]), reported a previous shoulder dislocation 
(25% [95% CI, 16-37] vs 3% [95% CI, 0-16]), experienced that their shoulder was 
loose (64% [95% CI, 52-76] vs 15% [95% CI, 5-32]), and reported discomfort due 
to other symptoms (odds ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.17-1.87]). Furthermore, a larger 
proportion had received supplemental treatment (analgesic medication, steroid 
injection/surgery).
CONCLUSIONS: Both groups with HSD and shoulder complaints presented with 
substantial shoulder-related impairments. Two-thirds reported mechanical 
symptoms, were younger, and more severely impaired than those without mechanical 
symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of managing mechanical 
shoulder symptoms to fully address the patients' impairments.

INTRODUCTION: Adhesions between the tendons to the interosseous muscles, the 
lumbrical muscles and occasionally the deep transverse metacarpal ligament can 
be symptomatic and cause chronic discomfort in the distal part of the hand. 
Reports about the condition are rare and the causal factors in previous 
publications are in principle limited to crush injuries and contusion from a 
direct blow to the hand. We present a case with typical clinic findings 
secondary to an infection after a cat bite. To the best of our knowledge 
symptomatic interosseous-lumbrical adhesions caused by an infection has never 
been described previously.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our case report describes a 25-year-old Caucasian woman with 
chronic pain and swelling between her second and third metacarpal heads. 
Symptoms occurred especially under stress and developed secondary to an 
infection after a cat bite. Surgical exploration revealed localized adhesions 
between her second lumbrical muscle, her first palmar interosseous muscle and 
her deep transverse metacarpal ligament. The symptoms were completely relieved 
by surgical release of the adhesions, partial resection of the deep transverse 
metacarpal ligament and immediate postoperative physiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians involved in hand surgery should be aware of the 
condition and look for it in patients complaining about distal intermetacarpal 
pain. The major causal factors for developing symptomatic interosseous-lumbrical 
adhesions are crush injuries or contusion to the distal part of the hand but it 
may also occur after an infection.

INTRODUCTION: We report a rare case of surgical treatment for an isolated 
lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury of the knee that was difficult to 
correctly diagnose considering physical findings alone of a judo athlete.
CASE REPORT: The 27-year-old man complained of pain on the lateral side of the 
right knee and discomfort and balance instability when climbing and descending 
stairs. During a judo match, he stepped on his right foot to prevent his 
opponent's waza (techniques), causing forced varus on his knee in a slight 
flexion position. His right knee showed no apparent sway in the manual test, but 
pain around the fibular head was induced in the figure-of-four position, and the 
LCL could not be palpated. Joint instability was not detected on varus stress 
roentgenography, but magnetic resonance imaging showed signal changes and an 
abnormal course in the fibula head insertion at the distal part of the LCL. 
Although no instability was observed objectively, clinical findings diagnosed 
LCL as an isolated injury, and surgical treatment was performed. Six months 
after the operation, his symptoms improved, and he resumed competing in judo.
CONCLUSION: To correctly diagnose an isolated LCL injury of the knee, it is 
important to consider patient history and physical findings. Repair of the 
injury could improve subjective symptoms, such as pain, discomfort, and balance 
instability, even if objective instability is not observed.

Effects of Sono-feedback during aspiration of Baker's cysts: A controlled 
clinical trial.

Çağlayan G(1), Özçakar L, Kaymak SU, Kaymak B, Tan AA.

Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (diagnostic and interventional) ultrasound 
imaging can be used to provide visual feedback affecting treatment outcome (pain 
and disability).
DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial.
SUBJECTS: A total of 52 patients with (ultrasonographically confirmed) 
symptomatic Baker's cysts were enrolled.
METHODS: The cysts were drained under ultrasound guidance and, if necessary, 
corticosteroid injections were given on the follow-up visit. In group I (n = 26) 
the patients did not observe the procedures on the ultrasound (US) screen. In 
group II (n = 26) the US images/videos were shown and explained to the patients. 
The patients were included in one of the groups consecutively, unless they 
refused the protocol of that group. Treatment outcome was assessed via US 
measurements, aspirate volumes, visual analogue scale (VAS) (knee pain, 
procedure discomfort), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index (WOMAC), Rauschning-Lindgren Classification (RLC), Kellgren-Lawrence 
grading scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and paracetamol intake.
RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar regarding US measurements, aspirate volume 
and paracetamol use (p-values > 0.05). In both groups all VAS (p < 0.001) and 
WOMAC (p < 0.05) scores decreased after treatment. Although initial VAS and 
WOMAC scores were similar between the groups, all VAS/WOMAC scores, except 
VAS-2, WOMAC-2 pain, and WOMAC-3 stiffness, were significantly lower in group II 
(all p < 0.05). Initial RLC scores were similar between the groups; however, 
group II had significantly lower scores at visits 2 and 3.
CONCLUSION: In patients with Baker's cysts (diagnostic/interventional) US 
imaging can be used as a simple means of visual biofeedback, favourably 
affecting the treatment outcome (pain and disability).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a clavicular hook plate with 
coracoclavicular ligament augmentation by suture anchor in the treatment of Neer 
types Ⅱ and Ⅴ distal clavicle fractures.
METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2016, 16 patients with Neer types Ⅱ and Ⅴ 
distal clavicle fractures were treated with clavicle hook plates and 
coracoclavicular ligament augmentation by suture anchor. There were 12 males and 
4 females with an average age of 45.6 years (range, 14-81 years). The injury 
mechanism included falling in 10 cases, traffic accident injury in 2 cases, 
falling from height in 2 cases, and heavy object injury in 2 cases. The Neer 
classification of clavicle fractures included 2 cases of type Ⅱa, 13 cases of 
type Ⅱb, and 1 case of type Ⅴ. The injury severity score (ISS) was 6-29, with an 
average of 11.2. The time from injury to operation was 1-18 days, with an 
average of 6.4 days. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, 
hospitalization stay, fracture healing, and postoperative complications were 
recorded; the disability of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, the shoulder 
joint Constant score, and the Oxford shoulder score (OSS) were used to evaluate 
the shoulder joint at last follow-up.
RESULTS: All operations were successfully completed. The operation time was 
50-100 minutes, with an average of 75.6 minutes; intraoperative blood loss was 
30-100 mL, with an average of 52.8 mL; hospitalization stay was 4-47 days, with 
an average of 13.7 days. All patients were followed up 1.2-7.5 years, with an 
average of 3.5 years. All clavicle fractures healed, and the healing time was 
9.4-13.6 weeks, with an average of 11.9 weeks. No fracture nonunion, fracture 
displacement, failure of internal fixation, or incision infection, etc. 
occurred. Fifteen patients took out the hook plate after fracture healing and 
functional recovery, and 1 case refused to remove the hook plate from the second 
operation because of no obvious discomfort. At last follow-up, the DASH score 
was 0-13, with an average of 2.2; the shoulder joint Constant score was 90-100, 
with an average of 96.8; the OSS score was 12-14, with an average of 12.3.
CONCLUSION: Clavicular hook plate with coracoclavicular ligament augmentation by 
suture anchor can help achieve good effectiveness with less postoperative 
complication in the treatment of Neer types Ⅱ and Ⅴ distal clavicular fractures.

RATIONALE: Leakage of bone cement from femoral medullary cavity is a rare 
complication after hip arthroplasty, and there is no report on the leaked bone 
cement entering into iliac vessels.
PATIENT CONCERNS: An 89-year-old woman presented with a fracture in the right 
femoral neck. She had well-fixed right femoral head replacement after careful 
preoperative examinations, and no adverse reactions appeared. She was able to 
get off bed to walk at the 2nd day after surgery.
DIAGNOSES: Postoperative radiograph showed leakage of bone cement into the joint 
through femoral medullary cavity entering into iliac vessels, but the patient 
complained no discomforts. She received a treatment with low-molecular weight 
heparin and rivaroxaban.
OUTCOMES: The patient was able to walk with normal gait, without swelling in 
both lower extremities and discomfort in the hip. There was no other 
complication concerning intravascular foreign bodies.
LESSONS: This case calls into the phenomenon of leakage of injected bone cement 
in femoral head replacement regardless of complete and nonfractured femur, which 
may be into the lower limb and pelvic veins, given that, dangerous consequences 
will not occur.

Vocal indicators of welfare have proven their use for many farmed and zoo 
animals and may be applied to farmed silver foxes as these animals display high 
vocal activity toward humans. Farmed silver foxes were selected mainly for fur, 
size, and litter sizes, but not for attitudes to people, so they are fearful of 
humans and have short-term welfare problems in their proximity. With a human 
approach test, we designed here the steady increase and decrease of fox-human 
distance and registered vocal responses of 25 farmed silver foxes. We analyzed 
the features of vocalizations produced by the foxes at different fox-human 
distances, assuming that changes in vocal responses reflect the degrees of 
human-related discomfort. For revealing the discomfort-related vocal traits in 
farmed silver foxes, we proposed and tested the algorithm of "joint calls," 
equally applicable for analysis of all calls independently on their structure, 
either tonal or noisy. We discuss that the increase in proportion of time spent 
vocalizing and the shift of call energy toward higher frequencies may be 
integral vocal characteristics of short-term welfare problems in farmed silver 
foxes and probably in other captive mammals.

BACKGROUND: Pelvic alignment changes during pregnancy and post-childbirth. 
Pelvic belts exert external forces that compress and stabilize the joints, and 
therefore, could influence pelvic alignment. However, limited information is 
available regarding this potential effect. Therefore, the purpose of this study 
is to investigate the influence of pelvic belt use on pelvic alignment during 
and after pregnancy.
METHODS: Data of 201 pregnant women in late pregnancy and 1 month after 
childbirth were used. Pelvic alignment measurements, including anterior and 
posterior pelvic width, pelvic asymmetry, and pelvic belt use during and after 
pregnancy were investigated. Participants were divided into four groups 
according to pelvic belt use: before and after childbirth (BAC), before 
childbirth only (BC), after childbirth only (AC), and non-use (NU). Then, an 
initial one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the amount of change in pelvic 
alignment from late pregnancy to post-childbirth between the groups. After the 
initial analysis, a multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine 
the statistically significant differences between the groups to consider other 
factors that influenced pelvic alignment such as age, BMI, number of previous 
childbirths, vaginal delivery and pelvic asymmetry in late pregnancy. Next, a 
cutoff point for subgroup stratification based on the weekly duration of pelvic 
belt use and inter-group changes in pelvic alignment were compared.
RESULTS: As the result of the initial one-way ANOVA, the decrease in pelvic 
asymmetry from during pregnancy to postpartum for BAC was greater than that for 
AC. Moreover, multiple regression analysis showed that the effect of pelvic belt 
that was revealed in the initial analysis was statistical significance even 
after adjustment for other factors. Moreover, pelvic asymmetry in the BAC group 
decreased, compared to being increased or unchanged in the NU and AC groups when 
the group cutoff time was 7 h per week.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and extended use of pelvic belts during and after 
pregnancy might be related to modifications of pelvic asymmetry in the perinatal 
period. Therefore, the instruction of correct and comfortable usage and the 
recommendation of continuous use of pelvic belt especially during pregnancy are 
required for prevention of some discomforts related to pelvic malalignment.

BACKGROUND: Radial head dislocation with no associated lesions, is a relatively 
uncommon injury in children. In this case report, it is reported a case of 
anteromedial locked radial head dislocation in children, and we discuss its 
clinical presentation and pathogenetic mechanism of injury.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old girl fell off on her right forearm with her 
right elbow extended in hyperpronation. An isolated radio-capitellar dislocation 
was identified with no other fractures or neurovascular injuries associated. 
Elbow presented an extension-flexion arc limited (0°- 90°), and the 
prono-supination during general anesthesia shows "a sling effect" from maximal 
pronation (+ 55°) and supination (+ 90°) to neutral position of forearm. The 
radial head dislocation was impossible to reduce and an open reduction was 
performed using lateral Kocher approach. The radial head was found 
"button-holed" through the anterior capsule. The lateral soft tissues were 
severely disrupted and the annular ligament was not identifiable. Only by 
cutting the lateral bundle of the capsule was possible to reduce the joint. At 
50 moths follow-up, patient presented a complete Range of motion (ROM), complete 
functionality and no discomfort or instability even during sport activities.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It is important to understand the pathogenic 
mechanisms of locked radial head dislocation in children. Some mechanism 
described are the distal biceps tendon or the brachialis tendon interposition. 
However even the anterior capsule can hinder reduction. A characteristic 
"sling-effect" of the forearm could be pathognomonic for capsular button-holing. 
Surgical release of the capsular bundle sometimes is the only way to reduce the 
dislocation and obtain a good outcome.

Clinical and biomechanical trials have shown that rigid internal fixation during 
ankle arthrodesis leads to increased rates of union and is associated with a 
reduced infection rate, union time, discomfort and earlier mobilisation compared 
with other methods. We describe our technique of ankle arthrodesis using 
anterior plating with a narrow dynamic compression plate (DCP). Between 2004 and 
2007, 29 patients with a mean age of 24.4 years (range 18-42) had ankle 
arthrodesis using an anteriorly placed narrow DCP. Twenty-two patients were 
post-traumatic and seven were paralytic (five after spine fracture and two after 
common peroneal nerve injury). Follow-up was between 12 and 18 months (average 
14 months). A rate of fusion of 100% was achieved at an average of 12.2 weeks. 
According to the Mazur ankle score, 65.5% had excellent, 20.7% good and 13.8% 
fair results. Ankle arthrodesis using an anteriorly placed narrow DCP is a good 
method to achieve ankle fusion in many types of ankle arthropathies.

Louis, MO 63104, USA.

Background. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1) has a variety of associated 
orthopaedic manifestations that have been previously reported. We report a case 
of severe, grade 4 knee osteoarthritis (OA) with recurrent subluxation and joint 
laxity due to multiple extra-articular neurofibromas ultimately treated with 
Above the Knee Amputation (AKA). Case Description. A 39-year-old man presented 
with multiple neurofibromas and lymphedema leading to degenerative changes of 
the knee. Conservative treatment failed due to the severity of the knee 
degeneration and patient discomfort. Likewise, arthroplasty was not possible due 
to poor bone quality and joint instability. Therefore, AKA was selected to 
relieve symptoms and provide functional improvement. six months after the 
procedure the patient has increased functional capacity for ambulation and 
activities of daily living, as well as significant decrease in pain and 
discomfort. Clinical Relevance. Extra-articular neurofibromas causing severe 
secondary OA in relatively young patients can be functionally improved with AKA 
and prosthetic device use.

INTRODUCTION: Dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) stabilizes the knee 
joint during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) healing. After 6 months, tibial 
hardware removal is offered to the patients if local discomfort at the implant 
site is present.
AIM: This study compared knee laxity and functional scores 2 years after DIS 
between patients with and without hardware removal. It is hypothesized that it 
does not affect ACL healing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed prospectively 
collected data from 173 patients with either hardware removal (n = 47) or no 
additional intervention (n = 126). Inverse probability of treatment weighting 
using the propensity score was applied to balance the groups for baseline 
characteristics. The primary outcome was the side-to-side difference in knee 
laxity measured with the rolimeter at manual maximum force (Δ-Lachman). 
Secondary outcomes were the pivot-shift test and subjective scores.
RESULTS: Mean age was 34 years in both groups, and female gender was 47% 
(hardware removal group) and 50% (control group), respectively. No significant 
differences were found for Δ-Lachman (p = 0.09), pivot-shift test (p = 0.41), 
and subjective scores (p > 0.10) two years after DIS.
CONCLUSION: Knee laxity 2 years after DIS in patients with tibial hardware 
removal and patients without hardware removal was not significantly different. 
The groups were also similar regarding all the assessed functional scores. This 
study confirms the hypothesis that the healing ACL resumes its stabilizing role, 
and the hardware can be removed beginning 6 months after surgery without adverse 
consequences for joint stability.

Expanding Panjabi's stability model to express movement: a theoretical model.

Hoffman J(1), Gabel P.

Novel theoretical models of movement have historically inspired the creation of 
new methods for the application of human movement. The landmark theoretical 
model of spinal stability by Panjabi in 1992 led to the creation of an exercise 
approach to spinal stability. This approach however was later challenged, most 
significantly due to a lack of favourable clinical effect. The concepts explored 
in this paper address and consider the deficiencies of Panjabi's model then 
propose an evolution and expansion from a special model of stability to a 
general one of movement. It is proposed that two body-wide symbiotic elements 
are present within all movement systems, stability and mobility. The 
justification for this is derived from the observable clinical environment. It 
is clinically recognised that these two elements are present and identifiable 
throughout the body in different joints and muscles, and the neural conduction 
system. In order to generalise the Panjabi model of stability to include and 
illustrate movement, a matching parallel mobility system with the same 
subsystems was conceptually created. In this expanded theoretical model, the new 
mobility system is placed beside the existing stability system and subsystems. 
The ability of both stability and mobility systems to work in harmony will 
subsequently determine the quality of movement. Conversely, malfunction of 
either system, or their subsystems, will deleteriously affect all other 
subsystems and consequently overall movement quality. For this reason, in the 
rehabilitation exercise environment, focus should be placed on the simultaneous 
involvement of both the stability and mobility systems. It is suggested that the 
individual's relevant functional harmonious movements should be challenged at 
the highest possible level without pain or discomfort. It is anticipated that 
this conceptual expansion of the theoretical model of stability to one with the 
symbiotic inclusion of mobility, will provide new understandings on human 
movement. The use of this model may provide a universal system for body movement 
analysis and understanding musculoskeletal disorders. In turn, this may lead to 
a simple categorisation system alluding to the functional face-value of a wide 
range of commonly used passive, active or combined musculoskeletal 
interventions. Further research is required to investigate the mechanisms that 
enable or interfere with harmonious body movements. Such work may then 
potentially lead to new and evolved evidence based interventions.

BACKGROUND: Snapping triceps tendon is an increasingly recognized clinical 
entity, which is associated with a variety of pathologic factors. The causative 
factors include inherited structural or developmental variations, post-traumatic 
malalignment, and other reasons. The main complaint of patients with snapping 
lateral triceps are the snapping sensation, mild muscle weakness of elbow 
extension, with or without tenderness in distal triceps tendon. Many treatment 
options have been reported previously, including tendon resection and 
redirection.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 19-year-old boy with post-traumatic 
distal lateral head of triceps tendon dislocation who complained of extension 
weakness and snapping sensation in his left elbow. Then, we used 
two-strand-overhand locking (TSOL) knot combined with double pulley technique to 
redirect the snapping triceps tendon.
CONCLUSION: The patient recovered well after the operation without complaining 
of discomfort. This fixing and redirection tendon technique, described 
previously for repairing rotator cuff tears, may be applied in a similar fashion 
for the snapping triceps tendon with promising clinical results.

Subpubic cartilaginous cystic lesion presenting as a vulvar mass: a case report.

Hoogendoorn R, Kayser H, Weening J, van Geloven A.

INTRODUCTION: A subpubic cartilaginous cyst is a rare and innocent defect 
originating from the symphysis pubis and may present as a vulvar mass and/or 
chronic abdominal pain. The symphysis pubis is a non-synovial amphiarthrodial 
joint that forms a fibrocartilaginous union between the two pubic bones and in 
general lies without mainstream interest, despite its clinical relevance. This 
case report focuses attention on this joint.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a painful and 
rapidly increasing vulvar mass. Imaging techniques revealed a cyst-like 
structure originating from a degenerated symphysis pubis. The cyst was excised, 
however, recovery was complicated by a symphysiolysis.
CONCLUSION: A subpubic cartilaginous cyst is a rare cystic lesion originating 
from the symphysis of the pubic bone which presents as a vulvar mass which might 
be complicated by symphysiolysis. Several diseases affect the symphysis pubis 
and result in significant discomfort and disability in patients. The symphysis 
pubis is therefore clinically important and should not be omitted in the 
differential diagnosis of a vulvar mass and/or chronic abdominal pain.

    Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2014 Nov;472(11):3468-70.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of chondroblastoma in the femoral head is challenging 
owing to the particular location and its aggressive nature. There is little 
published information to guide the surgeon regarding the appropriate approach to 
treating a chondroblastoma in this location. We developed a modified trapdoor 
procedure to address this issue. The primary modification is that the window 
surface of the femoral head is covered by the ligamentum teres rather than 
cartilage as in the traditional procedure.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We assessed (1) the clinical presentation of chondroblastoma 
of the femoral head and treatment results with the modified trapdoor procedure 
in terms of (2) the frequency of local recurrence, (3) complications, and (4) 
functional outcomes using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score.
METHODS: Between 1999 and 2010, we treated 14 patients for chondroblastoma of 
the femoral head. All patients received the modified trapdoor procedure. Of 
those, 13 were available for followup at a minimum of 36 months (mean, 
66 months; range, 36-117 months) and one patient was lost to followup. There 
were nine males and four females, with a mean age of 18 years (range, 
9-29 years). Clinical features were ascertained by chart and radiographic 
review, and recurrence, complications, and functional outcomes (MSTS score) were 
recorded from chart review. Patterns of bone destruction were evaluated using 
the Lodwick classification, which ranges from IA (geographic appearance with 
sclerotic rim) to III (permeative appearance).
RESULTS: The symptoms at diagnosis were pain in nine patients and discomfort in 
four. The mean duration of symptom was 11 months (range, 1-36 months). The 
physis was open in two patients, closing in one, and closed in 10. The patterns 
of bone destruction were evaluated as Lodwick Class IA in six patients, Lodwick 
Class IB in five, and Lodwick Class IC in two. At latest followup, no local 
recurrence was observed. Two patients had postoperative complications. One had 
avascular necrosis of the femoral head and was treated with prosthesis 
replacement. The other had asymptomatic heterotopic ossification in the surgical 
field. The mean MSTS score was 29.6 (range, 28-30).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this small series, we believe our modified trapdoor 
procedure is a safe, effective means of treating a chondroblastoma in the 
femoral head, but additional clinical evaluation with more patients is necessary 
to confirm our findings.

In sports, there is a constant discussion about the hyper-pronation and 
supination of the foot during loading and its relation to injuries or 
discomfort. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possible 
differences in the subtalar joint in the midstance phase of running, between 
individuals with Pes Planus and Pes Cavus, after 5 min and 45 min of running. 
Thirty-four subjects, meeting the requirements for Pes Planus (30 feet) and Pes 
Cavus (35 feet), according to the criteria for Medial Longitudinal Arch-angle, 
were included in the study. The calcaneal vertical angle, representing the 
eversion/inversion of the subtalar joint, was measured using with 
two-dimensional digital analysis and Dartfish Software with the subjects running 
barefoot on a treadmill, before and after 45 min of outside running wearing 
shoes. Both individuals with Pes Cavus and Pes Planus showed a significant 
increase in the calcaneal eversion (P<0.05) after 45 min of running. Between the 
groups, there was a significantly greater eversion of the Pes Planus, on the 
right foot, after 45 min of running (P<0.05) compared to the Pes Cavus. The 
effect of fatigue evident in the present study suggests that further 
biomechanical research should be considered when exposing the foot to the 
repetitive nature of running, conditions most likely responsible for the 
overrepresented overuse injuries among runners.

INTRODUCTION: Significant losses of muscle mass and function occur after major 
abdominal surgery. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to 
reduce muscle atrophy in some patient groups, but evidence in post-operative 
patients is limited. This study assesses the efficacy of NMES for attenuating 
muscle atrophy and functional declines following major abdominal surgery in 
older adults.
METHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing open colorectal resection completed a split 
body randomised control trial. Patients' lower limbs were randomised to control 
(CON) or NMES (STIM). The STIM limb underwent 15 minutes of quadriceps NMES 
twice daily on post-operative days (PODs) 1-4. Ultrasound measurements of Vastus 
Lateralis cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) were made 
preoperatively and on POD 5, as was dynamometry to determine knee extensor 
strength (KES). Change in CSA was the primary outcome. All outcomes were 
statistically analysed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: NMES significantly reduced the loss of CSA (-2.52 versus -9.16%, P < 
0.001), MT (-2.76 versus -8.145, P = 0.001) and KES (-10.35 versus -19.69%, P = 
0.03) compared to CON. No adverse events occurred, and patients reported that 
NMES caused minimal or no discomfort and felt that ~90-minutes of NMES daily 
would be tolerable.
DISCUSSION: NMES reduces losses of muscle mass and function following major 
abdominal surgery, and as such, may be the promising tool for post-operative 
recovery. This is important in preventing long-term post-operative dependency, 
especially in the increasingly frail older patients undergoing major abdominal 
surgery. Further studies should establish the efficacy of bilateral NMES for 
improving patient-centred outcomes.

Although global demand for palm oil has been increasing, most activities in the 
oil palm plantations still rely heavily on manual labour, which includes fresh 
fruit bunch (FFB) harvesting and loose fruit (LF) collection. As a result, 
harvesters and/or collectors face ergonomic risks resulting in musculoskeletal 
disorder (MSD) due to awkward, extreme and repetitive posture during their daily 
work routines. Traditionally, indirect approaches were adopted to assess these 
risks using a survey or manual visual observations. In this study, a direct 
measurement approach was performed using Inertial Measurement Units, and surface 
Electromyography sensors. The instruments were attached to different body parts 
of the plantation workers to quantify their muscle activities and assess the 
ergonomics risks during FFB harvesting and LF collection. The results revealed 
that the workers generally displayed poor and discomfort posture in both 
activities. Biceps, multifidus and longissimus muscles were found to be heavily 
used during FFB harvesting. Longissimus, iliocostalis, and multifidus muscles 
were the most used muscles during LF collection. These findings can be 
beneficial in the design of various assistive tools which could improve workers' 
posture, reduce the risk of injury and MSD, and potentially improve their 
overall productivity and quality of life.

Human movement requires an ongoing, finely tuned interaction between muscular 
and tendinous tissues, so changes in the properties of either tissue could have 
important functional consequences. One condition that alters the functional 
demands placed on lower limb muscle-tendon units is the use of high-heeled shoes 
(HH), which force the foot into a plantarflexed position. Long-term HH use has 
been found to shorten medial gastrocnemius muscle fascicles and increase 
Achilles tendon stiffness, but the consequences of these changes for locomotor 
muscle-tendon function are unknown. This study examined the effects of habitual 
HH use on the neuromechanical behavior of triceps surae muscles during walking. 
The study population consisted of 9 habitual high heel wearers who had worn 
shoes with a minimum heel height of 5 cm at least 40 h/wk for a minimum of 2 yr, 
and 10 control participants who habitually wore heels for less than 10 h/wk. 
Participants walked at a self-selected speed over level ground while ground 
reaction forces, ankle and knee joint kinematics, lower limb muscle activity, 
and gastrocnemius fascicle length data were acquired. In long-term HH wearers, 
walking in HH resulted in substantial increases in muscle fascicle strains and 
muscle activation during the stance phase compared with barefoot walking. The 
results suggest that long-term high heel use may compromise muscle efficiency in 
walking and are consistent with reports that HH wearers often experience 
discomfort and muscle fatigue. Long-term HH use may also increase the risk of 
strain injuries.

BACKGROUND: Unloader braces are a nonsurgical approach for predominantly 
unicompartmental knee arthritis. Although noninvasive, braces are expensive and 
it is unclear whether clinical factors, if any, will predict regular brace use.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Do patients continue to use the unloader brace 
more than 1 year after it is prescribed? (2) Do any clinical or radiographic 
factors predict continued use of the unloader brace after the first year? (3) 
What are the most common subjective reasons that patients give for discontinuing 
the brace?
METHODS: We administered 110 surveys to all patients who were fitted for 
unloader knee braces for predominantly unicompartmental osteoarthritis 12 to 40 
months before administration of the survey. Standardized indications and fitting 
protocols were used. The following parameters were tested for association with 
ongoing brace use: alignment, arthritis severity, compartment involved, BMI, 
weight, age, gender, pain and function, number of refittings, and problems with 
the brace. The survey response rate was 81% (89 of 110).
RESULTS: Of the 89 responders, 28% reported regular brace use (twice per week, 
an hour at a time, or more); at 2 years, 25% used the brace regularly. No 
clinical or radiographic factors considered were associated with ongoing brace 
use. Patients reported lack of symptomatic relief, brace discomfort, poor fit, 
and skin irritation as reasons for discontinuing the brace.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons and patients need to balance the benefits and absence of 
complications of bracing against cost and the low likelihood of ongoing use 1 
year or more after the prescription of the brace.

Delayed presentation of osteochondroma on the ventral surface of the scapula.

Kwon OS(1), Kelly JI.

Osteochondroma is a cartilage-covered bony excrescence that arises from the 
surface of a bone. It is the most common benign bone tumor in the scapula and 
can also present as multiple masses in multiple hereditary exostosis. A solitary 
scapular lesion might lead to "snapping scapula" syndrome, which is 
characterized by a sometimes audible but usually palpable grinding sensation 
experienced with scapular abduction. Snapping scapula is usually painless 
without specific symptoms; however, discomfort may result from the mechanical 
effects of a ventral scapular mass projecting onto a normally smooth, gliding 
scapulothoracic joint. Furthermore, malignant transformation of the 
cartilaginous cap, by virtue of the increased mass, may precipitate symptoms. 
The visual deformities and interference with major joint function are the most 
frequent musculoskeletal complaints related by patients. Indications for 
operative intervention include painful mechanical dysfunction unresponsive to 
conservative measures and sarcomatous change. Ventral scapular osteochondromas 
have been reported to cause scapular asymmetry and should be ruled out as part 
of a differential diagnosis to a "winged" scapula. A solitary osteochondroma can 
be excised either by arthroscopic or by open means, with the size of the lesion 
dictating precise management. Scapular osteochondromas usually are detected 
early during maturation due to mechanical symptoms or gross deformity. 
Unfortunately, most require surgical excision. Most surgical excisions have been 
reported in adolescents and young adults. We report an unusual case of 
osteochondroma from the ventral surface of the scapula in 56-year-old woman who 
had experienced delayed onset mechanical symptoms which required surgical 
excision.

Virginia, USA.

Rib injuries are common in collegiate rowing. The purpose of this case report is 
to provide insight into examination, evaluation, and treatment of persistent 
costochondritis in an elite athlete as well as propose an explanation for 
chronic dysfunction. The case involved a 21 year old female collegiate rower 
with multiple episodes of costochondritis over a 1-year period of time. Symptoms 
were localized to the left third costosternal junction and bilaterally at the 
fourth costosternal junction with moderate swelling. Initial interventions were 
directed at the costosternal joint, but only mild, temporary relief of symptoms 
was attained. Reexamination findings included hypomobility of the upper thoracic 
spine, costovertebral joints, and lateral ribs. Interventions included postural 
exercises and manual therapies directed at the lateral and posterior rib 
structures to improve rib and thoracic spine mobility. Over a 3-week time period 
pain experienced throughout the day had subsided (visual analog scale - VAS 
0/10). She was able to resume running and elliptical aerobic training with 
minimal discomfort (VAS 2/10) and began to reintegrate into collegiate rowing. 
Examination of the lateral ribs, cervical and thoracic spine should be part of 
the comprehensive evaluation of costochondritis. Addressing posterior 
hypomobility may have allowed for a more thorough recovery in this case study.

BACKGROUND: Shoulder, neck, and back discomforts and abdominal obesity caused by 
sedentariness are increasingly prominent in young and middle-aged population 
groups. Health Qigong improves physical functions and strengthens the disease 
resistance of exercisers. This study aims to explore health Qigong 
intervention's effects on the cervical vertebra, lumbar vertebra, and mental 
status.
METHODS: A total of 108 sedentary young and middle-aged faculties from Yantai 
University in China were recruited from July to December 2020 and randomly 
classified into the experimental and control groups. The former received health 
Qigong exercises for 12 weeks, and the latter was not intervened. The total 
general skeletal muscle mass, range of neck joint motion, mental health, and 
range of waist joint motion of all respondents before and after the intervention 
were tested and calculated.
RESULTS: The body fat rate of the experimental group after intervention was 
significantly lower than that before intervention (P<0.05). The skeletal muscle 
mass (SMM) value was significantly higher than that before intervention. The 
experimental group had lower body fat rate but higher SMM value than the control 
group after the intervention. In addition, the range of motion (ROM) of the 
cervical vertebra was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the 
control group after intervention. Somatization, obsessive/compulsive disorder, 
interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoia, and SCL-90 
total score of the experimental group after intervention decreased significantly 
compared with that before intervention (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Health Qigong improves the ROM of cervical and lumbar vertebrae and 
the mental health status of sedentary young and middle-aged groups.

Carpal tunnel syndrome presents a constellation of symptoms which include 
discomfort (eg, pain, paraesthesia) and diminished sense of touch. This 
exploratory study simultaneously measured changes in tactile threshold and 
discomfort ratings during prolonged wrist flexion in symptomatic patients from a 
rehabilitation clinic and from a control population. Prolonged (15 min) wrist 
flexion significantly increased tactile threshold and discomfort ratings above 
baseline levels in both symptomatic and control populations. Sixty-two percent 
of the symptomatic sample was found to have abnormal conduction latency. Tactile 
threshold in symptomatic subjects with normal conduction latency (n = 13) did 
not differ significantly from control subjects (n = 36) at baseline but showed 
significant elevation during wrist flexion. In contrast, subjects with abnormal 
conduction latency (n = 21) exhibited significant elevation relative to control 
subjects at baseline and throughout wrist flexion as well as a slower recovery 
after flexion. Conduction latency correlated with baseline (r = .52, P < .0001) 
and 15-min (r = .67, P < .0001) tactile threshold for the entire subject 
population, as well as 15-min threshold (r = .53, P = .013) for the 
subpopulation with abnormal conduction latency. At 2.5 min after flexion, 
correlation was significant for whole (r = .64, P < .0001) and abnormal 
conduction latency (r = .58, P = .0063) samples. Regression slope of tactile 
threshold versus conduction latency was significantly greater than zero and did 
not differ significantly from linearity. The study demonstrates that increases 
in mechanosensory threshold and discomfort ratings during prolonged wrist 
flexion are more profound (and recovery less rapid) in patients with 
electrophysiologic evidence of injury.
PERSPECTIVE: This study demonstrates a provocative procedure that enhances the 
symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. This measure may help clinicians 
discriminate median nerve compression from other types of peripheral nerve 
injury and help researchers investigate the impact of mechanical stress, tissue 
compression, and vascular stasis on compression-related neuropathy.

Essentiality of boron for healthy bones and joints.

Newnham RE(1).

Author information:

Since 1963, evidence has accumulated that suggests boron is a safe and effective 
treatment for some forms of arthritis. The initial evidence was that boron 
supplementation alleviated arthritic pain and discomfort of the author. This was 
followed by findings from numerous other observations epidemiologic and 
controlled animal and human experiments. These findings included a) analytical 
evidence of lower boron concentrations in femur heads, bones, and synovial fluid 
from people with arthritis than from those without this disorder; b) observation 
evidence that bones of patients using boron supplements are much harder to cut 
than those of patients not using supplements; c) epidemiologic evidence that in 
areas of the world where boron intakes usually are 1.0 mg or less/day the 
estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 20 to 70%, whereas in areas of the 
world where boron intakes are usually 3 to 10 mg, the estimated incidence of 
arthritis ranges from 0 to 10%; d) experimental evidence that rats with induced 
arthritis benefit from orally or intraperitoneally administered boron; e) 
experimental evidence from a double-blind placebo-boron supplementation trial 
with 20 subjects with osteoarthritis. A significant favorable response to a 6 mg 
boron/day supplement was obtained; 50% of subjects receiving the supplement 
improved compared to only 10% receiving the placebo. The preceding data indicate 
that boron is an essential nutrient for healthy bones and joints, and that 
further research into the use of boron for the treatment or prevention of 
arthritis is warranted.

A field evaluation method for assessing whole body biomechanical joint stress in 
manual lifting tasks.

Li, Taiwan, ROC.

Work-related musculoskeletal injuries are often associated with overexertion of 
the body at work. The manual materials handling activity of lifting is a major 
source of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Biomechanical evaluation 
offers useful information about the physical stress imposed on the worker's body 
joints; however, biomechanical analysis is usually tedious and complex. For 
evaluation purpose, the biomechanical method needs to be easy to apply in a 
field environment. Manual lifting occurs as one of the most common manual 
materials handling tasks in the workplace. A biomechanical evaluation method was 
developed based on the ratio of joint moment to joint capacity. The method was 
applied to evaluate the physical stress of manual lifting in truck loading jobs 
using a nine-link whole body joint model. Thirty eight industrial tasks were 
evaluated using the developed joint moment ratio. The moment ratio was compared 
with subjectively rated body discomfort, overall workload, and the NIOSH lifting 
index. The moment ratio was found to have a high correlation with the NIOSH 
lifting index. The biomechanical method can be used with relatively simple 
equipment and procedure which may be suitable for on-site ergonomic evaluation.

PURPOSE: High tibial osteotomy (HTO) has been adopted as an effective surgery 
for medial degeneration of the osteoarthritis (OA) knee. However, satisfactory 
outcomes necessitate the precise creation and distraction of osteotomized wedges 
and the use of intraoperative X-ray images to continually monitor the 
wedge-related manipulation. Thus HTO is highly technique-demanding and has a 
high radiation exposure. We report a patient-specific instrument (PSI) guide for 
the precise creation and distraction of HTO wedge.
METHODS: This study first parameterized five HTO procedures to serve as a design 
rationale for an innovative PSI guide. Preoperative X-ray and computed 
tomography- (CT-) scanning images were used to design and fabricate PSI guides 
for clinical use. The weight-bearing line (WBL) of the ten patients was shifted 
to the Fujisawa's point and instrumented using the TomoFix system. The 
radiological results of the PSI-guided HTO surgery were evaluated by the WBL 
percentage and tibial slope.
RESULTS: All patients consistently showed an increased range of motion and a 
decrease in pain and discomfort at about three-month follow-up. This study 
demonstrates the satisfactory accuracy of the WBL adjustment and tibial slope 
maintenance after HTO with PSI guide. For all patients, the average pre- and 
postoperative WBL are, respectively, 14.2% and 60.2%, while the tibial slopes 
are 9.9 and 10.1 degrees. The standard deviations are 2.78 and 0.36, 
respectively, in postoperative WBL and tibial slope. The relative errors of the 
pre- and postoperative WBL percentage and tibial slope averaged 4.9% and 4.1%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Instead of using navigator systems, this study integrated 2D and 3D 
preoperative planning to create a PSI guide that could most likely render the 
outcomes close to the planning. The PSI guide is a precise procedure that is 
time-saving, radiation-reducing, and relatively easy to use. Precise osteotomy 
and good short-term results were achieved with the PSI guide.

BACKGROUND: Electrical stimulation is an established treatment for muscle 
weakness. However, traditional tectonic stimulation is poorly tolerated in 
children as a result of discomfort. Threshold electrical stimulation performed 
at night reportedly increases muscle strength in a variety of neuromuscular 
conditions and has been well tolerated in children.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether threshold electrical stimulation treatment 
at night would increase strength and function in children with myelomeningocele.
METHODS: In a pilot study we prospectively followed 15 treated children who 
served as his or her own control. The patients were provided with a stimulator 
and instructed to use it on areas of muscular weakness during sleep, six nights 
per week. Followup phone calls at 2 weeks and then monthly were performed by a 
physical therapist to address patient concerns. Assessments of muscle strength, 
monofilament sensation, and physical function using the Functional Independence 
Measure for Children were to be performed at 3-month intervals up to 12 months 
and compared with the pretreatment assessment.
RESULTS: Only seven of the 15 subjects completed 9 months of treatment and none 
finished the 1-year study. The most frequent complaint was the treatment 
schedule was too intensive for the benefits received. We found small gains in 
muscle strength, gait, and bowel continence but no changes in physical function.
CONCLUSIONS: Although threshold electrical stimulation made small improvements 
in muscle strength, the currently recommended treatment schedules are not 
practical for patients with myelomeningocele.

We presented a case of a 25-year-old woman with early posttraumatic degenerative 
change to the articular cartilage accompanied with valgus malalignment despite 
receiving anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction after a multiligamentous 
injury sustained 2 years earlier. Rapid deteriorating valgus malalignment may 
result from chronic instability and intra-articular bone loss. Simultaneous 
distal femoral varus osteotomy and posterolateral complex reconstruction were 
performed during a single surgery. Six months after the surgery, the patient 
could walk briskly and climb stairs without any discomfort. Salvage procedures 
and biological reconstruction could be the primary choice for young patients to 
recover their knee function while avoiding joint replacement.

The impact of ultramarathons (UM) on the organs, especially in professional 
athletes, is poorly understood. We tested a 36-year-old UM male runner before 
and after winning a 24-h marathon. The primary goal of the study was 
cardiovascular assessment. The athlete experienced right knee pain for the first 
time after 12 h of running (approximately 130 km), which intensified, affecting 
his performance. The competitors ran on a 1984 m rectangle-loop (950 × 42 m) in 
an atypical clockwise fashion. The winner completed 516 rectangular corners. 
Right knee Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) one day after the run showed general 
overload in addition to degenerative as well as specific features associated 
with "turning to the right". Re-examination after three years revealed none of 
these findings. Different kinds of overloading of the right lower limb, 
including right knee pain, were indicated in 6 of 10 competitors from the top 
20, including a woman who set the world record. The affected competitors 
suggested as cause for discomfort the shape of the loop and running direction. 
They believed that changing the direction of the run during the competition and 
an athletics stadium loop shape on a 2000-2500 m length is better for 24-h UM 
runners. In the absence of technical alternatives, the "necessary evil" is a 
counterclockwise run (also Association of Athletics Federations IAAF 
recommendation). Results suggest that a one-way, clockwise, 24-h UM run had an 
adverse effect on the athlete's right knee, as a result of unsymmetrical load. 
Organizers of 24-h UM runs should consider the shape of the competition loop and 
apply the principle of uniform load on the musculoskeletal system (alternate 
directions run). In case of technical impossibility, it would be better to run 
counterclockwise, which is more common, preferred by runners, and recommended by 
the IAAF.

The diagnostic work-up of atypical chest pain frequently leads to invasive 
procedures. However, this painful symptomatology can sometimes be of benign 
origin and respond to simple therapeutic manoeuvres. A number of musculoskeletal 
conditions such as costovertebral joint dysfunctions should be carefully 
considered. We report five cases in which patient discomfort and high costs 
could have been avoided if awareness of these conditions had led to a correct 
diagnosis upon initial physical examination.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the validity and reliability of 
the Turkish version (ICOAP-TR) of the intermittent and constant osteoarthritis 
pain (ICOAP) questionnaire in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: Thirty-eight volunteer patients diagnosed with knee OA answered the 
questionnaire twice with an interval of 2-4 days. The reliability of the 
measurement was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and intraclass 
correlation (ICC) for test-retest reliability. Criterion validity was tested 
against the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) 
pain score and visual analog scale (VAS) designed to assess the perceived 
discomfort rated by the patient.
RESULTS: Test-retest reliability was found to be ICC=0.942 for total score, 
0.902 for constant pain subscale, and 0.945 for intermittent pain subscale. 
Internal consistency was tested using Cronbach's alpha and was found to be 0.970 
for total score, 0.948 for constant pain subscale, and 0.972 for intermittent 
pain subscale. For criterion validity, the correlation between the total score 
of ICOAP-TR and WOMAC pain subscale was r=0.779 (p<0.05), and correlation 
between total score of ICOAP-TR and VAS was r=0.570 (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The ICOAP-TR is a reliable and valid instrument to be used with 
patients with knee OA.

INTRODUCTION: Overlapping pubic symphysis dislocation (OPSD) or a locked pubic 
symphysis is a compression of the pelvic ring with the intact pubis trapped into 
the contralateral obturator foramen. Reduction can be difficult and 
contralateral suprapubic osteotomy is a good way to address the irreducible 
OPSD. The technique has only been discussed thrice in the available literature.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 26-year-old man who had his right pubic 
ramus entrapped within the contralateral obturator foramen, having an overlap of 
>4 cm with associated ipsilateral sacroiliac joint (SI joint) disruption and 
urethral injury. When all the maneuvers of closed and instrumented open 
reduction failed, we performed a superior pubic ramus osteotomy on the left side 
and unlocked the incarcerated right pubic ramus. The osteotomy site was 
stabilized with a 6-hole recon plate and SI joint was stabilized with a 6.5mm 
percutaneous sacroiliac screw. The patient underwent delayed urethral repair at 
10 weeks after the index surgery. At 3-year follow-up, the patient did not 
report any pubic discomfort, urinary and sexual problems.
CONCLUSION: Locked OPSD is a rare injury and is frequently associated with 
sacroiliac and urethral injuries. Distraction osteotomy of the contralateral 
superior pubic ramus is a viable option for irreducible cases.

France.

BACKGROUND: The anterior midline skin incision in a TKA provides excellent 
surgical exposure. However, it usually requires sectioning the infrapatellar 
branch of the saphenous nerve which may be associated with lateral cutaneous 
hypesthesia and neuroma formation.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether an anterolateral skin incision to the knee 
would decrease the area of skin hypesthesia and associated postoperative 
discomfort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomized 69 knees to receive a TKA through either a 
midline or an anterolateral skin incision. We assessed skin sensitivity by 
application of the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at 13 reference points at 6 
weeks and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The area of hypesthesia was measured 
using Mesurim Pro 9(®) software. Patient knee ROM, Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and WOMAC clinical score also were 
assessed.
RESULTS: The area of hypesthesia was less after an anterolateral compared with a 
midline incision up to 1 year after surgery: the areas of hypesthesia were, 
respectively, 32 cm(2) versus 76 cm(2) at 6 weeks, 14 cm(2) versus 29 cm(2) at 6 
months, and 7 cm(2) versus 19 cm(2) at 1 year. Clinical scores and knee ROM were 
similar in both groups at each followup. At 1 year, in the entire group we 
observed a correlation between a smaller area of paresthesia and better WOMAC 
and KOOS scores and greater knee flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the midline skin incision, the anterolateral incision 
is associated with fewer sensory disturbances and appears to be a reasonable 
alternative in TKA.

BACKGROUND: Because the patients undergoing medial patellofemoral ligament 
reconstruction (MPFLr) combined with medial tibial tubercle transfer (TTT) 
procedure are usually young and active, the quality of life (QoL) is also an 
important prognostic factor for patients with recurrent patellar dislocation. 
Assessing QoL can provide more useful and accurate evidence for the effects of 
this procedure. This study aimed to evaluate QoL following MPFLr combined with 
TTT, compared with isolated MPFLr (iMPFLr).
METHODS: Fifty-one patients who underwent iMPFLr + TTT and 48 patients who 
underwent iMPFLr were included. Clinical evaluation included QoL (EQ-5D-5L and 
EQ-5D VAS), functional outcomes (Kujala, Lysholm and Tegner activity scores), 
physical examinations (patellar apprehension test and range of motion) and 
redislocation rates. Radiological evaluation included patellar tilt angle and 
bisect offset. These preoperative and postoperative results were compared 
between groups at baseline and the final follow-up. The paired and independent t 
tests were used for the data following a normal distribution. Otherwise, the 
Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the differences. 
Categorical variables were compared by chi-square or Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: All of the QoL (EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D VAS), clinical results and 
radiological outcomes significantly improved in both groups at the final 
follow-up, with no significant differences between groups. There was no 
significant difference in five dimensions of EQ-5D at the final follow-up, 
although percentages of people with problems of mobility and pain/discomfort 
were higher in the MPFLr + TTT group. Female patients had lower EQ-5D index and 
EQ-5D VAS compared with male patients in both groups at the final follow-up, but 
there was only a significant difference in the EQ-5D VAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Both MPFLr + TTT and iMPFLr groups obtained similar and 
satisfactory improvements in the QoL, clinical results and radiological 
outcomes, indicating that MPFLr combined with TTT is a safe and effective 
procedure, which can significantly improve the QoL for patients with recurrent 
patellar dislocation in cases of pathologically lateralized TT. However, female 
patients obtained lower QoL than males.

Gold bead implantation has been used for years as an alternative method to 
improve function in chronic joint disease both in humans and dogs. The aims of 
the present study were to describe the technique of implanting 24-karat gold 
beads around the hip joints of dogs with chronic hip dysplasia, and to record 
any side effects or complications of such treatment. A prospective 
placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial was performed. Eighty dogs were 
randomly allocated to treatment or placebo, with 38 in the gold implantation 
group and 42 in the placebo group, and followed intensely for six months. The 
implantation technique was simple to perform, using fluoroscopy and with the 
dogs under inhalation anesthesia for about 30 minutes. Adverse effects, measured 
as pain or discomfort, were seen for a period of up to four weeks in 15 of the 
dogs in the gold implantation group, compared to six dogs in the placebo group. 
During implantation, a technical difficulty occurred as 82% of the dogs showed 
leakage of blood and/or synovia from the needles. The dogs in the gold 
implantation group were radiographed 18 months later. Of the 30 dogs that were 
radiographed at both inclusion and 24 months, 80% (24 dogs) showed a 
deterioration of the coxofemoral arthrosis, the other six had stable disease 
evaluated by radiography. Migration of gold beads was only observed in one dog.

We present a case of a 28-year-old man with a severe osteoarthritic varus knee 
after a neglected multiligamentous injury sustained 10 years prior. Simultaneous 
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) 
reconstructions with high tibial osteotomy (HTO) were performed at a single 
stage. Five years after surgery, there were no signs of effusion and no 
instability, and the patient could easily kneel down without any discomfort. We 
think that salvage procedures and biological reconstructions would be the 
primary choice of surgical treatment in young patients to delay arthroplasty, 
and it is possible to perform simultaneous reconstructions of ACL and PCL with 
HTO in a single stage.

Post-traumatic premature closure of the distal fibular growth plate is a rare 
entity leading to shortening of the lateral malleolus. We report on a 14-year 
old boy who presented with a 4-year history of worsening, diffuse discomfort and 
swelling of his left ankle, as well as fibular shortening and talar 
malreduction. He had sustained a distal tibial fracture 4 years earlier and had 
been treated with closed reduction. He reported instability of the ankle and 
difficulty with running. There was 1-cm shortening of the left fibula, 1-cm 
shortening of the proximal fibula, and slight widening of the medial clear 
space. Both tibial and fibular growth plates were already closed and the left 
ankle joint space was slightly narrowed. He was treated with late fibular 
lengthening and autogenous iliac crest tricortical bone grafting and achieved 
anatomic restoration of the distal tibiofibular relationship. At one-year 
follow-up, the ankle-hindfoot score had improved from 69 to 100.

Menopausal symptoms and quality of life (QOL) of pre- and postmenopausal women 
in Sri Lanka have not been studied adequately. This study aimed to evaluate the 
prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and the QOL of pre- and 
postmenopausal women in Galle District, Sri Lanka. A cross-sectional study was 
conducted with a randomly selected sample of premenopausal (n=184) and 
postmenopausal (n=166) community-dwelling healthy women aged 30-60 years. The 
mean (SD) ages of pre- and postmenopausal women, respectively, were 46.1(3.7) 
and 55.8(3.8) years. Menopausal symptoms were evaluated using the menopause 
rating scale under three subscales: psychological symptoms, somatovegetative 
symptoms, and urogenital symptoms. The QOL was evaluated using the short form 36 
survey under eight domains. Further, sociodemographic status, gynaecologic 
factors, physical activity pattern (walking, moderate, and vigorous), body mass 
index, and waist to hip ratio were also evaluated. The prevalence and severity 
of all the menopausal symptoms were higher among postmenopausal women. In 
premenopausal women, the most frequently reported menopausal symptoms were 
mental exhaustion (49.5%), joint and muscular discomforts (48.5%), and 
irritability (41.3%). Physical and mental exhaustion (53%), irritability 
(48.2%), depressive mood (43.4%), and hot flushes (42.2%) were the most 
frequently reported menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. The QOL was 
significantly impaired among postmenopausal women [mean (SD); 57.47(18.83)] 
compared to premenopausal women [mean (SD); 66.82(17.93)] (p<0.001). 
Psychological symptoms score and somatovegetative symptoms score were associated 
with the QOL of premenopausal women (adjusted R2; 0.35). Somatovegetative 
symptoms score, psychological symptoms score, moderate and vigorous physical 
activity scores, and monthly income were associated with the QOL in 
postmenopausal women (adjusted R2; 0.38). The current study showed that the 
prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and impaired QOL were 
significantly higher among postmenopausal women, compared to premenopausal 
women. Menopausal symptoms mostly contributed to the poorer QOL in both pre- and 
postmenopausal women.

INTRODUCTION: Kinesio-Taping(®) (K-Tape) is used in sports traumatology with the 
aim of reducing pain and improving blood and lymph circulation. The main 
objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of K-Tape on early 
postoperative pain after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The 
study hypothesis was that K-Tape significantly decreases pain.
METHOD: A prospective non-randomized comparative study was conducted in 
2013-2014 and included all patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction by 
hamstring graft. Analgesia was standardized. Two groups, "K-Tape" and 
"controls", were formed according to the days on which the study physiotherapist 
was present. The K-Tape compression/decompression assembly was applied 
immediately postoperatively and maintained for 3days. Patients filled out online 
questionnaires. The main assessment criterion was mean postoperative pain 
(D0-D3) on a 0-to-10 scale. Secondary criteria were analgesia intake on the 
three WHO levels, awakening during the night of D0 due to pain, signs of 
postoperative discomfort, and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Sixty patients (30 per group) were included, 57 of whom could be 
assessed: 28 K-Tape, 29 controls; 44 male, 13 female; mean age, 30.9±8.9 years. 
At inclusion, the two groups were comparable. There was no significant 
difference in mean (D0-D3) knee pain intensity: 3.8±2.2 for K-Tape, and 3.9±2 
for controls (P=0.93). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) found no significant 
intergroup difference in evolution of pain (P=0.34). There were no other 
significant differences on the other assessment criteria.
CONCLUSION: K-Tape showed no efficacy on early postoperative pain following ACL 
reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: Dislocation or liner dissociation of a total hip prosthesis usually 
results in pain and discomfort. Although several reports describe chronic 
dislocation and its treatment, chronic liner dissociation is an unreported 
complication.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report an unrecognized dissociation and displacement of the 
liner of a total hip prosthesis after revision THA. The patient had virtually no 
pain or functional restrictions. The patient's only complaint was pain on the 
contralateral side, associated with a leg-length discrepancy. Since the patient 
had no complaints relative to the liner dissociation we elected not to pursue 
further treatment. The contralateral pain was treated successfully with a shoe 
lift.
LITERATURE REVIEW: Chronic dislocation of a THA is a rare complication and we 
found reports of only seven cases in the literature. We found no reports of 
chronic liner dissociation.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the possibility of 
this rare complication. Our case and the literature suggest treatment can be 
nonsurgical or surgical.

Femoral head fracture with large crushed defect in weight-bearing area treated 
with autologous osteochondral transplantation (repositionplasty): A case report.

Cheongju, Korea.

RATIONALE: Femoral head fracture is a rare type of fracture commonly associated 
with hip dislocation. Femoral head fracture treatments include conservative 
treatment, fragment excision, open reduction, internal fixation, and 
arthroplasty. In cases of young patients, open reduction and internal fixation 
are preferred over arthroplasty. Pipkin type 2 fractures are treated with open 
reduction and internal fixation in most cases because the fracture line extends 
upward of the fovea and includes the femoral head-acetabular weight-bearing 
joint surface. However, if the fracture is severely comminuted or crushed, good 
results are difficult to obtain with open reduction and internal fixation.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-years-old male patient presented to the emergency room 
with right hip pain after 4-m fall.
DIAGNOSIS: In initial image work up, he was diagnosed with right posterior hip 
dislocation and a Pipkin type 2 femoral head fracture with an ipsilateral 
superior ramus fracture. After manual reduction, simple radiography and computed 
tomography showed reduction of the hip joint and a large osteochondral defect of 
approximately 6 cm2 in the weight-bearing area on the superomedial side of the 
femoral head.
INTERVENTIONS: This was treated with a novel surgery named autologous 
osteochondral transplantation (repositionplasty), devised by the authors.
OUTCOMES: The congruent reduction was confirmed by radiography and computed 
tomography immediately after the surgery. At 5 years postoperatively, the Harris 
Hip Score was 100 points and no discomfort, femoral head collapse, 
osteonecrosis, or traumatic arthritis were observed on follow-up radiographs.
LESSONS: We think this method "repositionplasty" will be a good treatment method 
for young patients with a large defect in the weight-bearing part of the femoral 
head who cannot undergo open reduction and internal fixation.

Various robotic exoskeletons have been proposed for hand function assistance 
during activities of daily living (ADL) of stroke survivors. However, 
traditional exoskeletons involve the use of complex rigid systems that impede 
the natural movement of joints, and thus reduce the wearability and cause 
discomfort to the user. The objective of this paper is to design and evaluate a 
soft robotic glove that is able to provide hand function assistance using 
fabric-reinforced soft pneumatic actuators. These actuators are made of silicone 
rubber which has an elastic modulus similar to human tissues. Thus, they are 
intrinsically soft and compliant. Upon air pressurization, they are able to 
support finger range of motion (ROM) and generate the desired actuation of the 
finger joints. In this work, the soft actuators were characterized in terms of 
their blocked tip force, normal and frictional grip force outputs. Combining the 
soft actuators and flexible textile materials, a soft robotic glove was 
developed for grasping assistance during ADL for stroke survivors. The glove was 
evaluated on five healthy participants for its assisted ROM and grip strength. 
Pilot test was performed in two stroke survivors to evaluate the efficacy of the 
glove in assisting functional grasping activities. Our results demonstrated that 
the actuators designed in this study could generate desired force output at a 
low air pressure. The glove had a high kinematic transparency and did not affect 
the active ROM of the finger joints when it was being worn by the participants. 
With the assistance of the glove, the participants were able to perform grasping 
actions with sufficient assisted ROM and grip strength, without any voluntary 
effort. Additionally, pilot test on stroke survivors demonstrated that the 
patient's grasping performance improved with the presence and assistance of the 
glove. Patient feedback questionnaires also showed high level of patient 
satisfaction and comfort. In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the 
possibility of using soft wearable exoskeletons that are more wearable, 
lightweight, and suitable to be used on a daily basis for hand function 
assistance of stroke survivors during activities of daily living.

Sternoclavicular joint subluxation/dislocation injuries in the athlete are 
uncommon. They can be organised by degree (subluxation, dislocation), timing 
(acute, chronic, recurrent, congenital), direction (anterior, posterior), and 
cause (traumatic, atraumatic). The unusual case reported is an adolescent 
butterfly swimmer with recurrent bilateral sternoclavicular subluxation 
associated with pain and discomfort. The condition was treated and resolved with 
conservative management. The diagnosis, investigations, and treatment options 
are discussed.

A 17-year-old previously healthy man presented with a 4-week history of 
progressive bilateral leg swelling with discomfort and erythema, but no signs of 
arthritis or erythema nodosum. An incidental finding of a query pulmonary nodule 
on chest X-ray prompted chest CT for further evaluation, revealing bilateral 
hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient then underwent endobronchial 
ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration biopsies of mediastinal lymph 
nodes. Biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were negative for 
microbiology, including mycobacterial culture. Pathology demonstrated 
non-caseating granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Weeks 
later, he developed arthralgias of the left metacarpophalangeal joints and 
erythema nodosum and was diagnosed with Löfgren syndrome, a phenomenon rarely 
described in the paediatric population. This case highlights an approach to 
lower extremity swelling as well as hilar lymphadenopathy in the paediatric 
population. In addition, it emphasises the importance of multidisciplinary 
teamwork for accurate and timely diagnoses.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the signs and symptoms of 
temporomandibular disorders (TMD) as well as the relationships between TMD, 
malocclusion and the need for orthodontic treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty consecutive patients (36 F, 4 M) with a median age 
of 35 (IQR 18) years. Eighteen patients had Class I, 22 patients Class II 
malocclusion. A rating scale for the influence of TMJ pain/discomfort on the 
activities of daily living (ADL) was used simultaneously with clinical 
examination. Helkimo's Dysfunction Index (D(i)) and the Index of Orthodontic 
Treatment Need (IOTN) were determined for each participant.
RESULTS: Pain/discomfort in the TMJ area was positively correlated with 
interferences in laterotrusion (p=0.021), pain on palpation over the posterior 
aspects of TMJ (p=0.012) and pain in the masticatory muscles (p=0.023). The 
impact of TMJ pain/discomfort was greatest on the performance of a yawn and on 
opening the mouth wide. There was no statistically significant correlation 
between malocclusion, D(i)and IOTN. A comparison of Class I malocclusion 
patients to those with Class II malocclusion revealed no statistically relevant 
differences in Di and ADL.
CONCLUSION: In patients with malocclusion, pain from TMJ has a significant 
negative impact on activities of daily living. No significant differences were 
observed between Angle Class I and Class II groups of patients with respect to 
TMD. Orthodontic treatment was required for both groups.

A 48-year-old female patient presented with discomfort in the front of the 
chest. Whole spinal X-ray revealed a thoracic curve of 52°, and thoracic 
computed tomography (CT) myelography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 
that ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) on the concave 
side of the apex vertebra (T9) had highly compressed the spinal cord. Cervical 
MRI also showed that the C4-C5 intervertebral disc herniation mildly compressed 
the spinal nerve. In concomitant surgery, the patient underwent cervical 
laminoplasty, in which OPLL was removed by decompressive laminectomy and 
posterior correction surgery.In patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD), 
asymmetric mechanical stress at the apex vertebra can cause various abnormal 
conditions. Long-term local mechanical stress on the concave side of the apex 
vertebra might have affected OPLL formation in the present case. This is the 
first report of a surgical case for an ossification located on the concave side 
of the apex vertebra in a patient with ASD. Mechanical stress at the concave 
side of the apex vertebra was suspected to be a cause of formation of OPLL.

A 14-year-old girl presented with idiopathic valgus deformity of her left great 
toe at the interphalangeal joint (IPJ). The deformity, which had been present 
but asymptomatic for the past 4 years, began to enlarge and cause discomfort. 
The measured IPJ angle on anteroposterior standing X-ray was 26°. We treated the 
toe by medial closing wedge osteotomy and fixation with a double compression 
headless bone screw (DCHBS). Postoperative hallux valgus interphalangeus (HVI) 
angle was 14°.

CONTEXT: Fatigue could contribute to ankle-sprain injuries during sport, 
particularly for individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI).
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether adults with or without CAI develop fatigue at 
similar rates when performing ankle exercises at the same relative effort level 
and whether these groups differ in their subjective perceptions of fatigue.
DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
SETTING: Biomechanics research laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 volunteers with CAI (1 man, 10 
women; age = 23.5 ± 3.0 years, height = 168.0 ± 11.2 cm, mass = 64.3 ± 13.5 kg) 
were recruited for the unstable-ankle group, and 11 volunteers matched for age, 
height, mass, and sex (1 man, 10 women; age = 24.1 ± 2.1 years, height = 169.5 ± 
9.7 cm, mass = 62.3 ± 9.7 kg) were recruited as control participants.
INTERVENTION(S): Localized muscle fatigue (LMF) was induced in the ankle of the 
dominant limb using a custom fatigue protocol. Plantar-flexion and dorsiflexion 
exertions were completed at a rate of 12 cycles per minute at isotonic loads 
equal to 70% and 30%, respectively, of individual maximal voluntary isometric 
strength. Intermittent measures of maximal voluntary isometric strength and 
ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were obtained.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We compared isometric-strength measures and RPE scores 
at each observation time (prefatigue and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 minutes into the 
fatigue protocol) and the group correlations between changes in strength and 
changes in RPE scores.
RESULTS: Based on ankle-strength measures, the 2 test groups developed LMF at 
similar rates when exercising at equivalent levels of relative effort. The 2 
groups also reported similar levels of discomfort as fatigue progressed.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of LMF development at the ankle and the associated 
perception of fatigue did not differ between adults with or without CAI.

BACKGROUND: In Middle Europe ultrasonography is the standard method used to 
screen for developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants. Our aim was to 
determine whether manual fixation of the child is equivalent to Graf's technique 
regarding image quality.
METHODS: This randomized trial was conducted at a free-standing general 
pediatric outpatient clinic in Vienna, Austria. Healthy infants in the 1st and 
between the 6th and 8th week of life with no hip malalignment were included. 
After randomization, Group 1 was examined using Graf's fixation device and 
participants in Group 2 were fixated on the examination couch by their parents. 
In a second step, all images underwent a blinded evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 117 babies (Group 1: n = 62, Group 2: n = 54, excluded: 
n = 1) were examined and 230 images (Group 1: n = 122, Group 2: n = 108) were 
evaluated, of which 225 were sonographically normal. Two images, showing a type 
IIa right hip and a type IIa + left hip respectively, were excluded. One 
participant had to be excluded as the respective images showed two pathologic 
hip joints. Two images in Group 1 and three in Group 2 were not evaluable. No 
statistical association between image quality (11 quality criteria and overall 
evaluability) and fixation technique (0.12 ≤ p ≤ 1.0 or constant) was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering sonographically normal hip joints, we found no evidence 
that manual fixation differed from Graf's technique regarding image quality. In 
future studies, hip pathologies should be included and discomfort of infants and 
parents during the examination should be addressed.

A man in his early 40s had revision reconstructive surgery on his left shoulder 
while in a right lateral decubitus position. The prolonged surgery (7 hours) 
caused acute compartment syndrome (ACS) in the contralateral (right) thigh. 
Moderate pain and swelling of the contralateral thigh ('well limb') was first 
noted in the recovery room. After progression to severe swelling and numbness in 
his right toes, fasciotomies of the right thigh were performed, confirming ACS. 
Thirteen months later he returned to his prior work without lower extremity 
discomfort or limitations, and he reported a good result from the revision 
shoulder surgery. Non-traumatic ACS of a well limb is a rare complication of 
surgery performed in the lateral decubitus position. We suggest that moving the 
patient temporarily, or to a new position (eg, beach chair), should be 
considered when the duration of surgery approaches 4.5 hours.

Rumination is a form of thought characterized by repetitive focus on 
discomforting emotions or stimuli. In chronic pain disorders, rumination can 
impede treatment efficacy. The brain mechanisms underlying rumination about 
chronic pain are not understood. Interestingly, a link between rumination and 
functional connectivity (FC) of the brain's default mode network (DMN) has been 
identified within the context of mood disorders. We, and others, have also found 
DMN dysfunction in chronic pain populations. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 
is a key node of the DMN that is anatomically connected with the descending pain 
modulatory system. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that in patients with 
chronic pain, the mPFC exhibits abnormal FC related to the patient's degree of 
rumination about their pain. Seventeen patients with idiopathic 
temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls 
underwent resting state functional MRI, and rumination about pain was assessed 
through the rumination subscale of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Compared with 
healthy controls, we found that TMD patients exhibited enhanced mPFC FC with 
other DMN regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus 
(PCu) and retrosplenial cortex. We also found that individual differences in 
pain rumination in the chronic pain patients (but not in healthy controls) were 
positively correlated to mPFC FC with the PCC/PCu, retrosplenial cortex, medial 
thalamus, and periaqueductal/periventricular gray. These data implicate 
communication within the DMN and of the DMN with the descending modulatory 
system as a mechanism underlying the degree to which patients ruminate about 
their chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Lower extremity muscle mass, strength, power, and physical 
performance are critical determinants of independent functioning in later life. 
Isokinetic dynamometers are becoming very common in assessing different features 
of muscle strength, in both research and clinical practice; however, reliability 
studies are still needed to support the extended use of those devices.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess the test-retest reliability of 
knee and ankle isokinetic and isometric strength testing protocols in a sample 
of older healthy subjects, using a new and untested isokinetic multi-joint 
evaluation system.
METHODS: Sixteen male and fourteen female older adults (mean age 65.2 ± 4.6 
years) were assessed in two testing sessions. Each participant performed a 
randomized testing procedure that includes different isometric and isokinetic 
tests for knee and ankle joints.
RESULTS: All participants concluded the trial safety and no subject reported any 
discomfort throughout the overall assessment. Coefficients of correlation 
between measures were calculated showing moderate to strong effects among all 
test-retest assessments and paired-sample t test showed only one significant 
difference (p<0.05) in the maximal isokinetic bilateral knee flexion torque.
CONCLUSIONS: The multi-joint evaluation system for the assessment of knee and 
ankle isokinetic and isometric strength provided reliable test-retest measures 
in healthy older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Hyaluronic acid is a major component of synovial fluid and 
cartilage; it plays an essential role in joint function. This concept is based 
on the hypothesis that intraarticular sodium hyaluronate injections improve 
articular function upon restoring synovial fluid viscosupplementation and 
promoting endogenous synthesis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty randomly selected patients older than 50 years of 
age, with a diagnosis of gonarthrosis, standard treatment-naïve, were divided 
into two 20-patient groups. The first group was treated with five 2.5 ml doses 
of hyaluronic acid, at one dose per week. The second group was treated with a 
single 2 ml dose of intraarticular methylprednisolone. A survey containing the 
Womac functional scale and the pain visual analogue scale was applied to both 
groups before and 3 months after treatment.
RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in pain (visual analogue scale) 
was observed 3 months after treatment in group H (1.6 +/- 0.88) and group M 
(2.95 +/- 1.84), as well as a functional post-treatment improvement in the Womac 
scale. Results for post-treatment pain were 5.43 +/- 1.05 for group H and 7.86 
+/- 0.77 for group M; results for post-treatment stiffness were 3.05 +/- 0.82 
for group H and 3.7 +/- 0.85 for group M; and finally for post-treatment 
functional capacity the results were 12.25 +/- 0.82 for group H and 18.95 +/- 
0.85 for group M.
CONCLUSION: Intraarticular sodium hyaluronate is more effective for pain and 
function than methylprednisolone. However, it involves higher costs than 
conservative treatment and fewer costs than surgical treatment, as well as the 
discomfort resulting from repeated intraarticular injections and the possibility 
of anaphylactic reaction.

OBJECTIVE To report complication rates following elective arthroscopy in horses 
and determine whether postoperative complication rates are higher for outpatient 
procedures, compared with inpatient procedures. DESIGN Retrospective cohort 
study. ANIMALS 357 client-owned horses that had undergone 366 elective 
arthroscopic procedures between January 2008 and February 2015. PROCEDURES 
Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included 
signalment, travel time to the hospital, clinical signs, joints treated, lesions 
diagnosed, medications administered, anesthesia and surgery times, details of 
the procedure (including closure method and surgeons involved), and 
hospitalization status (inpatient or outpatient). Inpatients were horses that 
remained hospitalized overnight, and outpatients were horses that were 
discharged in the afternoon of the day of surgery. The collected data were 
analyzed along with follow-up information to identify factors associated with 
postoperative complications and potentially associated with hospitalization 
status. RESULTS Data were collected on 366 elective arthroscopic procedures 
(outpatient, n = 168 [46%]; inpatient, 198 [54%]). Complications that occurred 
included bandage sores, catheter problems, colic, diarrhea, postoperative 
discomfort, esophageal impaction, fever, incisional drainage, postanesthetic 
myopathy, persistent synovitis, persistent lameness, septic arthritis, and 
osteochondral fragments not removed during the original surgery. None of these 
complications were associated with hospitalization status (outpatient vs 
inpatient). However, Standardbreds were overrepresented in the outpatient group, 
and anesthesia and surgery times were longer for the inpatient group. 
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that outpatient elective 
arthroscopy in healthy horses could be performed safely and without a higher 
risk of complications, com pared with similar procedures performed on an 
inpatient basis.

BACKGROUND: Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is an incompletely understood 
clinical concept that implies pathomechanical changes in the hip as a cause for 
hip-related pain in young adults. While a positive anterior impingement test is 
suggestive of FAI, its association with clinical and radiographic findings 
remain unconfirmed in healthy young adults.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined the prevalence of a positive test in 1170 
young adults and examined its possible associations with (1) self-reported hip 
discomfort for the past 3 months; (2) weekly physical exercise; (3) hip ROM; and 
(4) radiographic findings associated with femoroacetabular impingement.
METHODS: We invited 2344 healthy 19-year-olds to a population-based hip study 
between 2008 and 2009; 1170 patients (50%) consented. The study included 
questionnaires on medical and functional status, a clinical hip examination 
including the impingement test and hip ROM, and two pelvic radiographs (AP and 
frog-leg views).
RESULTS: Based on at least one affected hip, 35 of 480 (7.3%) men and 32 of 672 
(4.8%) women had positive impingement tests. Eighteen of the 1170 patients were 
excluded owing to suboptimal or missing radiographs. Self-reported hip 
discomfort in the women and increased physical exercise in the men were strongly 
associated with the positive impingement tests. Decreased abduction and internal 
rotation in the men, decreased flexion in both genders, and radiographic cam 
type findings in the men also were associated with positive tests.
CONCLUSION: A positive test for anterior impingement is not uncommon in healthy 
young adults, especially in males. We believe it always should be performed 
along with pelvic radiographs in young, active patients presenting with hip 
pain.

Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the lateral sacral plexus has been used for the 
treatment of sacroiliac joint pain including as an adjunct to other palliative 
therapies for the treatment of painful osseous metastasis. The treatment goal is 
targeted ablation of the dorsal lateral branches of S1-S4. Though several 
techniques have been described, the Simplicity III (Neurotherm, Middleton, MA) 
system allows for ablation to be achieved with a single RF probe by utilizing a 
multi-electrode curved RF probe to create a continuous ablation line across all 
sacral nerves. In the standard approach, there is sequential introduction of a 
spinal needle along the desired ablation tract for local anesthesia followed by 
separate placement of the ablation probe. Though fluoroscopic guidance is 
utilized, multiple needle passes increase the risk of complication such as bowel 
perforation or probe insertion through a neural foramen. It may also extend 
procedure time and increase radiation dose. We illustrate a technique for 
Simplicity III RF ablation of the dorsal sacral plexus using a modified 
Seldinger approach for treatment of a patient with sacroiliac joint pain due to 
osseous renal cell carcinoma metastasis. The desired ablation tract is initially 
anesthetized via a hollow micropuncture needle. The needle is then exchanged for 
a peelaway sheath. The RF probe is inserted through the peelaway sheath thus 
ensuring the probe is placed precisely along the previously anesthetized tract 
allowing the procedure to be completed using a single percutaneous puncture. We 
believe that this approach decreases the risks of bowel perforation, patient 
discomfort as a result of multiple percutaneous punctures, and procedure time.

BACKGROUND: Although local anaesthesia for knee arthroscopy is a well-documented 
procedure, arthroscopy under local anaesthesia is often interrupted because of 
intolerable discomfort and pain. Warming local anaesthetic solutions may 
increase its anaesthetic effect. We tested whether intra-articular injection of 
warmed lidocaine solution could improve intraoperative anaesthetic and 
postoperative analgesic conditions.
METHODS: Patients in the warmed group received 20 ml warmed (40 degrees C) 
lidocaine 1% intra-articularly 20 min before surgery. The patients in the 
control group received 20 ml room-temperature (25 degrees C) lidocaine 1% 
intra-articularly 20 min before surgery. During surgery, the patients reported 
pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS).
RESULTS: The median VAS pain score was 1.5 (range, 0.0-3.0) in the warmed 
lidocaine group and 5.0 (4.0-8.0) in the control group (P<0.001). The median 
intra- and postoperative analgesic requirements in the control group were 
significantly greater than that in the warmed group.
CONCLUSION: Warmed lidocaine injected intra-articularly provides improved 
intraoperative anaesthetic and postoperative analgesic conditions for patients 
undergoing knee arthroscopy.

Injuries to avascular regions of menisci do not heal and result in significant 
discomfort to patients. Current treatments, such as partial meniscectomy, 
alleviate these symptoms in the short term but lead to premature osteoarthritis 
as a result of compromised stability and changes in knee biomechanics. Thus, 
tissue engineering of the meniscus may provide an alternative treatment modality 
to overcome this problem. In this experiment, a scaffold-based 
tissue-engineering approach was utilized to regenerate the meniscus. Meniscus 
cells were cultured on poly-L-lactic acid scaffolds in normoxic (approximately 
21% oxygen) or hypoxic (approximately 2% oxygen) conditions in the presence or 
absence of the growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). At t = 4 
weeks, histological sections of constructs showed presence of collagen and 
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in all groups. Immunohistochemical staining showed the 
presence of collagen I in all groups and collagen II in groups cultured under 
hypoxic conditions. bFGF in the culture medium significantly increased cell 
number/construct by 25%, regardless of culture conditions. For GAG/construct, 
synergistic increases were observed in constructs cultured in hypoxic conditions 
and bFGF (two-fold) when compared to constructs cultured in normoxic conditions. 
Compressive tests showed synergistic increases in the relaxation modulus and 
coefficient of viscosity and additive increases in the instantaneous modulus for 
constructs cultured under hypoxic conditions and bFGF, when compared to 
constructs cultured under normoxic conditions. Overall, these results 
demonstrate that bFGF and hypoxia can significantly enhance the ability of 
meniscus cells to produce GAGs and improve the compressive properties of 
tissue-engineered meniscus constructs in vitro.

BACKGROUND: Patient perceptions of treatment success, including 
satisfaction/preference, may complement clinical efficacy assessments.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate satisfaction with subcutaneous 
golimumab and its auto-injector in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
an inadequate adalimumab/etanercept response.
METHODS: In the multicenter, assessor-blinded GO-SAVE study, 433 patients with 
active RA (28-joint Disease Activity Score incorporating erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate [DAS28-ESR] ≥ 3.6 and six or more swollen and six or more 
tender joints) despite methotrexate and past adalimumab/etanercept treatment 
received open-label subcutaneous golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) through 
week 12. Week 16 responders (DAS28-ESR improvement from baseline > 1.2 and 
score ≤ 3.2) continued therapy through week 52; nonresponders were randomized 
(1:2) to double-blind subcutaneous golimumab 50 mg q4w or intravenous golimumab 
2 mg/kg [weeks 16, 20, every 8 weeks (q8w)]. Patients rated satisfaction with 
their injection experience on a 5-point scale (1 = very dissatisfied; 5 = very 
satisfied) at screening, week 8 (all enrolled patients), and week 44 (for 
patients continuing open-label subcutaneous golimumab 50 mg q4w). Discomfort, 
pain, stinging, burning, and redness related to injection were assessed (none, 
mild, moderate, severe).
RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients (N = 433) had most recently received 
adalimumab (50.3%) or etanercept (49.7%) prior to golimumab. Overall 
satisfaction (somewhat/very) with the golimumab injection experience was 
reported by 84.4% of patients at week 8 versus 63.4% of patients who were 
satisfied with prior adalimumab/etanercept. Patients receiving open-label 
subcutaneous golimumab through week 44 (N = 75) reported much less discomfort 
(60.9%), redness (60.9%), pain (59.4%), stinging (67.2%), and burning (65.6%) 
with the golimumab injection than with their previous tumor necrosis factor 
antagonist medication injection.
CONCLUSION: Most patients with RA receiving golimumab following 
adalimumab/etanercept inadequate response were satisfied with their overall 
golimumab experience, including its auto-injector versus their previous 
injection device. CLINICAL TRIALS.GOV: NCT01004432; EudraCT 2009-010582-23.

Ilium fractures, which commonly advance from the iliac crest to the greater 
sciatic notch, are high-energy pelvic fractures that are frequently unstable. 
The general course of management for this injury is conservative, although cases 
of substantially displaced have been described that warranted surgical 
intervention. Many conditions, including decreased mobility, structural 
alterations in the joints, and discomfort, might make people more vulnerable to 
falls while waiting for hip or knee surgery. This can have an effect on both 
preoperative and postoperative functioning. The goal of surgical treatment for 
these individuals is to return them back to their prefracture state. This 
article presents the case of a 30-year-old male who was obtained a dash injury 
while riding a motorbike. He was diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon with 
right-sided iliac blade fracture extending towards sacroiliac joint with 
right-sided sacral ala fracture and superior pubic rami fracture extending 
toward iliopectineal line and right-sided inferior pubic rami fracture (Tile 
Classification Type B3). He was operated via open reduction and internal 
fixation (ORIF) with osteosynthesis plating was done. Following surgery, the 
patient was dependent and his daily living was hampered. However, physiotherapy 
intervention improved the patient's pain and physical functioning and he gained 
independence in carrying out daily activities.

In pursuit of P2X3 antagonists: novel therapeutics for chronic pain and afferent 
sensitization.

Treating pain by inhibiting ATP activation of P2X3-containing receptors heralds 
an exciting new approach to pain management, and Afferent's program marks the 
vanguard in a new class of drugs poised to explore this approach to meet the 
significant unmet needs in pain management. P2X3 receptor subunits are expressed 
predominately and selectively in so-called C- and Aδ-fiber primary afferent 
neurons in most tissues and organ systems, including skin, joints, and hollow 
organs, suggesting a high degree of specificity to the pain sensing system in 
the human body. P2X3 antagonists block the activation of these fibers by ATP and 
stand to offer an alternative approach to the management of pain and discomfort. 
In addition, P2X3 is expressed pre-synaptically at central terminals of C-fiber 
afferent neurons, where ATP further sensitizes transmission of painful signals. 
As a result of the selectivity of the expression of P2X3, there is a lower 
likelihood of adverse effects in the brain, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular 
tissues, effects which remain limiting factors for many existing pain 
therapeutics. In the periphery, ATP (the factor that triggers P2X3 receptor 
activation) can be released from various cells as a result of tissue 
inflammation, injury or stress, as well as visceral organ distension, and 
stimulate these local nociceptors. The P2X3 receptor rationale has aroused a 
formidable level of investigation producing many reports that clarify the 
potential role of ATP as a pain mediator, in chronic sensitized states in 
particular, and has piqued the interest of pharmaceutical companies. P2X 
receptor-mediated afferent activation has been implicated in inflammatory, 
visceral, and neuropathic pain states, as well as in airways hyperreactivity, 
migraine, itch, and cancer pain. It is well appreciated that oftentimes new 
mechanisms translate poorly from models into clinical efficacy and 
effectiveness; however, the breadth of activity seen from P2X3 inhibition in 
models offers a realistic chance that this novel mechanism to inhibit afferent 
nerve sensitization may find its place in the sun and bring some merciful relief 
to the torment of persistent discomfort and pain. The development philosophy at 
Afferent is to conduct proof of concept patient studies and best identify target 
patient groups that may benefit from this new intervention.

BACKGROUND: Polyethylene liner dissociation is a rare but catastrophic event in 
total hip arthroplasty (THA), and certain implant designs are known to be at 
greater risk. Although the DePuy Pinnacle (Warsaw, IN, USA) modular acetabular 
construct has an excellent record of fixation and wear, an unexpectedly high 
number of liner dissociations has been noted.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were (1) to characterize the 
clinical parameters observed in a large group of patients who have experienced 
liner dissociations with the DePuy Pinnacle acetabular component; (2) to 
describe the radiographic findings in this group of patients; and (3) to 
calculate a minimum frequency of this complication.
METHODS: Since 2001, 23 patients with previously well-functioning THAs presented 
with sudden atraumatic polyethylene liner dissociation at four separate 
institutions. These THAs were performed between 2001 and 2013. Eight different 
arthroplasty specialists had performed the index hip arthroplasties using the 
DePuy Pinnacle acetabular component with a polyethylene liner. Polyethylene 
failures were evaluated for liner type and radiographic cup position. For three 
of the surgeons who contributed cases, institutional registries allowed the 
calculation of the number of components of this type that they used during the 
period in question, which provided a conservative estimate of the frequency of 
this type of failure.
RESULTS: All 23 liner failures occurred atraumatically in previously 
asymptomatic THAs at a mean of 48 months (range, 3-138 months). Patients 
characteristically reported a new and sudden onset of discomfort with audible, 
reproducible squeaking. Surgical inspection of dissociated liners demonstrated 
displacement of polyethylene with shearing of the peripheral locking tabs. 
Radiographic evaluation demonstrated that 14 cups were well positioned and nine 
cups were malpositioned outside the so-called safe zone. Conservative estimates 
of the frequency of this complication from the three surgeons' practices whose 
institutional registries allowed calculation of the lowest possible frequency 
were 0.32% (six of 1888), 0.77% (three of 391), and 0.82% (three of 367).
CONCLUSIONS: With this report of 23 additional liner dissociations, we suggest 
that surgeons should be aware of the problem and take extra precautions when 
using this implant to ensure locking mechanism integrity at the time of surgery. 
We caution that the frequency of liner dissociation may be higher than 
previously reported.

OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of studies on the quality of life (QoL) after 
posterior laminectomy in patients with thoracic ossification of the ligamentum 
flavum (TOLF), and risk factors associated with poor prognosis remain 
controversial. Therefore, the present study was conducted to illustrate the QoL 
for TOLF patients after surgery and determine its relationship with their 
demographic, surgery-related, clinical characteristics and imaging data.
METHODS: One hundred and eighteen patients diagnosed with thoracic myelopathy 
because of TOLF were enrolled in this retrospective study. They all underwent 
posterior decompressive laminectomy from August 2010 to January 2022. The QoL 
was evaluated based on the EQ-5D-5L. Collecting gender, age, number of 
operations, compressed segments, Frankel grade, complications, body mass index 
(BMI), symptoms and duration, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) 
score (preoperative), follow-up time and type of ossification, increased signal 
on Sagittal T2-weighted Images (ISST2I), occupancy rate and analyzing by 
Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, the χ2 -test, and logistic regression 
tests.
RESULTS: Average follow-up 70.8 months (18-149), the mean age was 
59.74 ± 9.81 years and the mean score for the QoL based on the EQ-5D-5 L and 
visual analogue scale (VAS) score were 0.71 ± 0.28 and 78.88 ± 10.21 at the 
final follow-up. Moderate and severe problems were found in the pain/discomfort 
in 22.0% of the patients. These mobility and usual activities numbers were 
slightly higher (24.6% and 30.4%, respectively). The mean scores for QoL and VAS 
were significantly higher in patients with mild and moderate neurological 
impairment, normal BMI, <60 years of age, no dural tears, symptom relief at 
hospital discharge, unilateral and bilateral ossification on axial CT scan, 
≤ 50% spinal canal occupancy on CT and MRI, and none or fuzzy on ISST2I.
CONCLUSION: QoL after posterior laminectomy in TOLF patients is generally 
satisfactory compared to preoperative levels. Preoperative mJOA score, Age, 
comorbid diabetes, the major symptom is activity limitation, BMI, ISST2I, 
Intraoperative dural tears and spinal canal occupancy rate correlate 
significantly with the corresponding dimensions and are predictive. Age, spinal 
canal occupancy rate, ISST2I, preoperative mJOA score, BMI are significantly 
associated with and have predictive value for overall postoperative QoL.

PURPOSE: Dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) is a primary repair 
technique for acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. For internal bracing 
of the sutured ACL, a metal spring with 8 mm maximum length change is preloaded 
with 60-80 N and fixed to a high-strength polyethylene braid. The bulky tibial 
hardware results in bone loss and may cause local discomfort with the necessity 
of hardware removal. The technique has been previously investigated 
biomechanically; however, the amount of spring shortening during movement of the 
knee joint is unknown. Spring shortening is a crucial measure, because it 
defines the necessary dimensions of the spring and, therefore, the overall size 
of the implant.
METHODS: Seven Thiel-fixated human cadaveric knee joints were subjected to 
passive range of motion (flexion/extension, internal/external rotation in 90° 
flexion, and varus/valgus stress in 0° and 20° flexion) and stability tests 
(Lachman/KT-1000 testing in 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° flexion) in the 
ACL-intact, ACL-transected, and DIS-repaired state. Kinematic data of femur, 
tibia, and implant spring were recorded with an optical measurement system 
(Optotrak) and the positions of the bone tunnels were assessed by computed 
tomography. Length change of bone tunnel distance as a surrogate for spring 
shortening was then computed from kinematic data. Tunnel positioning in a 
circular zone with r = 5 mm was simulated to account for surgical precision and 
its influence on length change was assessed.
RESULTS: Over all range of motion and stability tests, spring shortening was 
highest (5.0 ± 0.2 mm) during varus stress in 0° knee flexion. During 
flexion/extension, spring shortening was always highest in full extension 
(3.8 ± 0.3 mm) for all specimens and all simulations of bone tunnels. Tunnel 
distance shortening was highest (0.15 mm/°) for posterior femoral and posterior 
tibial tunnel positioning and lowest (0.03 mm/°) for anterior femoral and 
anterior tibial tunnel positioning.
CONCLUSION: During passive flexion/extension, the highest spring shortening was 
consistently measured in full extension with a continuous decrease towards 
flexion. If preloading of the spring is performed in extension, the spring can 
be downsized to incorporate a maximum length change of 5 mm resulting in a 
smaller implant with less bone sacrifice and, therefore, improved conditions in 
case of revision surgery.

BACKGROUND: Synovitis is an inflammation-related disease linked to rheumatoid 
arthritis, osteoarthritis, infections and trauma. This inflammation is 
accompanied by immune cells infiltration which initiates an inflammatory 
response causing pain, discomfort and affecting the normal joint function. The 
treatment of synovitis is based on the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs 
or biological agents such as platelet rich plasma and mesenchymal stem cells. 
However, the evaluation and validation of more effective therapies of synovitis 
requires the establishment of clinically relevant animal models.
RESULTS: In this study, Large White pigs were pre-immunized to evaluate an 
antigen-induced synovitis. The immune monitoring of synovial fluids in this 
model allowed us the identification of IL-12p40 and T cell subsets as immune 
biomarkers. Moreover, the evolution of synovitis was performed by arthroscopic 
procedures and kinetic analysis. In summary, this paper describes an animal 
model of antigen-induced synovitis to be used in the evaluation of 
anti-inflammatory therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: The novelty of this paper lies in the development of a clinically 
relevant model of synovitis which permits the simultaneous evaluation of 
synovitis from an immunological, surgical and kinetic point of view.

of autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and platelet-rich 
plasma (PRP) to dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip joints. ANIMALS 22 
client-owned dogs (12 placebo-treated [control] dogs and 10 treated dogs). 
PROCEDURES Dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip joints that caused signs of 
lameness or discomfort were characterized on the basis of results of orthopedic 
examination, goniometry, lameness score, the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI), 
a visual analogue scale, and results obtained by use of a pressure-sensing 
walkway at week 0 (baseline). Dogs received a simultaneous intraarticular and IV 
injection of SVF and PRP or a placebo. Dogs were examined again 4, 8, 12, and 24 
weeks after injection. RESULTS CBPI scores were significantly lower for the 
treatment group at week 24, compared with scores for the control group. Mean 
visual analogue scale score for the treatment group was significantly higher at 
week 0 than at weeks 4, 8, or 24. Dogs with baseline peak vertical force (PVF) 
in the lowest 25th percentile were compared, and the treatment group had a 
significantly higher PVF than did the control group. After the SVF-PRP 
injection, fewer dogs in the treated group than in the control group had 
lameness confirmed during examination. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE For 
dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip joints treated with SVF and PRP, 
improvements in CBPI and PVF were evident at some time points, compared with 
results for the control group.

The zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) functions as a buttress for the face and 
is the cornerstone to a person's aesthetic appearance, by both setting the 
midfacial width and providing prominence to the cheek. Malar deficiency is often 
acquired by blunt injury incurred in a traumatic accident, resulting in ZMC 
fracture. A 48-year-old male patient presented a right ZMC fracture after 
contusion injury by a baseball. He only received conservative management and 
later he suffered discomfort during mouth opening at the moment of mastication, 
due to trismus involving the temporomandibular joint. In the current case, we 
describe a surgical technique, by which the malar body is shifted anteriorly and 
laterally after combined oblique-vertical osteotomy. The technique presented, 
eventually restored the former aesthetic position of the malar complex and 
symmetry, and, moreover, improved mastication function.

India.

BACKGROUND: A review of literature revealed that, although the involvement of 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is not 
uncommon, variation in presentation persist. Comparative studies of bony changes 
in the right and left TMJ with the right and left peripheral hand 
(Metacarpophalangeal-MCP)/wrist joints have not been done, to the best of our 
knowledge.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the temporomandibular and 
hand (MCP) and wrist joints of fifteen rheumatoid arthritis patients were 
evaluated with questionnaires, clinical and lab assessment and radiographically 
using conventional radiographs and computed tomography. Students t-test was 
applied for the statistical analysis of the data obtained and a P value of 0.05 
was considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Comparisons between the right TMJ with right MCP/wrist joint and left 
TMJ with left MCP/wrist joint did not reveal statistically significant results. 
Radiographically, flattening and erosions were the common manifestations. MCP 
joints were more affected than the wrist, but whenever the wrist was involved, 
it was more likely to be bilaterally affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the TMJ showed osseous changes of a higher grade than the 
hand (MCP) and wrist joints radiographically, it was observed that patients were 
more aware of the peripheral joint discomfort. There were no significant 
differences between TMJ and peripheral joints on both right and left sides.

INTRODUCTION: Treating a complex elbow injury known as the terrible triad, 
combined with a severe soft tissue trauma, is challenging for most orthopedic 
surgeons and can lead to permanent disabilities and poor functional outcomes if 
reconstruction is inadequate.
CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old male with a history of high blood pressure was 
injured in an accident involving agricultural equipment and presented with a 
triad injury of the left elbow: a posterolateral dislocation combined with 
fractures of the radial head (Mason-Johnson Type II) and ulnar coronoid process 
(Morrey Type 1). Fractures to the radial head and ulnar coronoid process and 
injuries to the lateral collateral ligament and triceps tendon were repaired, 
and a local skin flap was preserved to provide adequate soft tissue coverage. A 
hinged external fixator was applied to maintain elbow alignment and allow early 
mobilization. Traditional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was applied on 
the remaining skin defects; when local necrosis and septic arthritis of the 
elbow were noted, NPWT with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) was initiated. 
Once a viable wound bed was obtained, a split-thickness skin graft was used to 
provide total coverage. All wounds and fractures were healed within 8 weeks, the 
external fixator was removed, and free elbow joint mobilization was allowed. At 
3 months, the authors obtained 100°/30°/0° of elbow range of motion with a DASH 
3 at 30. At 6 months, the elbow range of motion reached 120°/20°/0° with a clear 
improvement of DASH score (DASH 6 at 14.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Management of this complex elbow injury that featured NPWTi-d 
contributed to a good result and facilitated coverage of an extensive loss of 
skin and soft tissue; more importantly, the patient experienced limited 
discomfort. A larger prospective study is required to support general 
recommendations for this approach to similar injury.

OBJECTIVE: We present a case of a 38-year-old postpartum woman who had 
antepartal undiagnosed sarcoma with multiple metastasis. Although the patient 
underwent aggressive treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, she died 3 months 
after the vaginal delivery of a healthy female infant weighing 2,090 g at 35 
weeks of gestation.
CASE REPORT: The patient had right shoulder pain and mild chest discomfort 
during the last trimester of the pregnancy. Six days after delivery, she came to 
our emergency room because her pain had become more severe. A humeral neck tumor 
with bone destruction was found in the right shoulder on X-ray. After detailed 
evaluation, right humeral surgery, cardiac surgery, and liver biopsy were 
performed. All the removed specimens were sent for pathologic examination, and 
the results showed a sarcoma favoring malignant fibrous histiocytoma with its 
primary origin in the left atrium.
CONCLUSION: Obstetricians should be aware that any non-specific complaint may be 
due to severe disease. It is better to evaluate all symptoms and signs that 
persist. In this case, early intervention such as radiologic imaging of the bone 
or echocardiography could have been performed during pregnancy to prevent tumor 
spread, maternal morbidity, and even death.

Rehabilitation, K. Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences, Poznań, Poland.

A population of 920 healthy children was studied with the aim of assessing the 
incidence of hamstring muscle and plantar foot flexor tightness, and to 
correlate such symptoms with gait, posture, and low back discomfort or pain. 
Special attention was paid to the popliteal angle and dorsal foot flexion. The 
borderline values for the popliteal angle in the following age groups were, 
boys: 3 to 5 years, 40 degrees; 6 to 15 years, 50 degrees; and 16 to 19 years, 
40 degrees; girls: 3 to 5 years, 30 degrees; 6 to 14 years, 45 degrees; 15 to 19 
years, 30 degrees. The borderline values for dorsal foot flexion in the 
following age groups were 3 to 4 years, 7 degrees; 5 to 13 years, 10 degrees; 
and 14 to 19 years, 5 degrees. The results obtained indicate a natural increase 
in hamstring tightness, particularly shortly before the pubertal growth spurt. 
This seems to be linked with the natural evolution of lumbar lordosis and pelvic 
tilt. When hamstring tightness surpassed borderline values, dorsiflexion and 
lumbar lordosis decreased leading to postural deformities, bending-forward 
deficit, discomfort when sitting, and a shambling gait.

BACKGROUND: "Phantom bite syndrome," a persistent complaint of an uncomfortable 
bite sensation with no obvious occlusal abnormal finding, recently was suggested 
to be related with central nervous system dysfunction. Here, we report a case of 
phantom bite syndrome in which the occlusal discomfort was improved with 
mirtazapine and aripiprazole combination parallel with regional cerebral blood 
flow change.
CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old-female patient came to our clinic with the chief 
complaint of a "loosely bite" after dental treatment and various uncomfortable 
sensations of body sites. One year after the medication therapy, the 
prosthodontic retreatment was carried out successfully, and a good outcome was 
obtained for over 24 months so far. In addition, a subsequent change of regional 
cerebral blood flow was observed in single-photon emission computed tomography: 
the right and left asymmetry of cerebral blood flow in the frontal lobe has 
disappeared along with the improvement to the symptoms improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that some central nervous system dysfunction 
involving dopaminergic system might be related to the pathophysiology of phantom 
bite syndrome.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung usually presents as a local rather than a 
metastatic disease. We present a 55-year-old male who was referred to the 
orthopedics and traumatology clinic for evaluation of pain and discomfort around 
the left ankle 2 months after diagnosis of locally advanced non-small cell 
(squamous cell) lung cancer. Physical examination revealed nonspecific pain and 
tenderness around the ankle. T2-weighted MR images showed lesions like a bone 
marrow edema around the talar head and neck. Whole body dynamic bone scan 
revealed a metastatic lesion only in the foot. The patient died 4 months after 
diagnosis of the metastasis. Early diagnosis of foot metastasis may be 
challenging and delays in diagnosis of up to 24 months have been reported. Foot 
metastases are usually associated with advanced metastatic disease and survival 
rates are poor. Although metastatic disease of the foot is rare, it should be 
considered in the diagnosis of a painful foot in the elderly lung cancer 
patients. Palliative treatments such as pain relief medications should be chosen 
for patients with an expectancy of short survival whereas aggressive approaches 
may be applied for those with longer survival expectations.

PURPOSE: To compare two groups of patients who underwent two different 
arthroscopic procedures for repair of articular-sided partial-thickness rotator 
cuff tears (PTRCTs).
MATERIALS: This is a comparative prospective study of two methods for repair of 
partial cuff tears: Thirty-two patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair with a transtendon technique (group 1); 28 underwent arthroscopic 
full-thickness conversion and repair of the lesion (group 2). ROM measures, 
clinical findings, MRI features (tendon healing and re-tear), Constant-Murley 
and ASES scores were assessed pre- and postoperatively and compared. Patients 
were also asked about return to sport and level of activity.
RESULTS: At the last appointment, patients of both the groups were significantly 
improved for clinical findings, ROM measures, imaging features, Constant-Murley 
and ASES scores than at baseline, without any significant inter-group 
difference. In group 1, 15 of 20 patients (75 %) who practiced recreational 
sport activities had returned to sport at the same level as before the onset of 
symptoms, without any discomfort. In group 2, 12 of 18 patients (67 %) had 
returned to the same level of sport activity they practiced before symptoms. At 
the last follow up, MRI showed rotator cuff healing in 31 patients of Group 1 
and 27 patients of Group 2 (p = 0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: The two procedures are safe, effective, and comparable.

Effects of a posture-sensing air seat device (PSASD) on kinematics and trunk 
muscle activity during continuous computer work.

University, Republic of Korea.

The prevalence and incidence of musculoskeletal disorders is high with computer 
workers, and poor sitting posture can be considered a factor contributing to low 
back discomfort. In the clinical literature, maintaining a neutral spinal 
curvature has been considered an optimal sitting posture. This study 
investigated the flexion and lateral flexion of trunk movements and trunk muscle 
activity during computer work with and without a posture-sensing air seat device 
(PSASD). By sensing a certain amount of increased pressure over the baseline, 
posture-related visual feedback was given to participants through the PSASD. 
Eleven regular computer workers participated in this study. PSASD had the 
function of alerting the subject to their poor posture by using visual feedback. 
Subjects performed 20 min of computer work with and without a PSASD. Surface 
electromyography was used to measure the activity of the erector spine and 
internal abdominal oblique. Kinematic data were obtained using an 
electrogoniometer. The results showed that the mean of trunk flexion and lateral 
flexion was significantly reduced with PSASD. The activity of the erector spine 
and internal oblique was significantly higher with the PSASD than without. Our 
findings indicated that the PSASD helps to prevent habitual poor posture by 
maintaining an erect sitting posture during prolonged computer work.

Anterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty: does it correlate with 
patellar blood flow?

PURPOSE: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) disturbs patellar blood flow, an 
unintended accompaniment to TKA that may be a cause of postoperative anterior 
knee pain. We examine whether disrupted patellar blood flow correlates with 
anterior knee pain following TKA.
METHODS: In 50 patients (21 men, 29 women) undergoing TKA, we compared patellar 
blood flow at flexions 0° to 30°, 60°, 90°, and 110° before and after medial 
parapatellar arthrotomy to pre- and postoperative anterior knee pain scores by 
means of a laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) probe. Anterior knee pain was assessed 
using the pain intensity numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 (0-no, 10-worst 
pain). Based on the NRS pain values, patients were divided into two main groups: 
group A (n = 34) with no pain or discomfort (NRS range 0-4) and group B (n = 16) 
with anterior knee pain (NRS range 5-10).
RESULTS: Patients of group B demonstrated a significant decrease in blood flow 
before arthrotomy at flexions from 0° to 90°, and 110° and from 0° to 60°, 90°, 
and 110° after arthrotomy. For group A, a significant decrease in blood flow was 
detected at flexions from 0° to 90°, and 110° before and after arthrotomy. For 
both groups, medial arthrotomy did not have a statistically significant 
influence on patellar blood flow (margin of significance P < 0.05). Prior to 
TKA, 16 of the 50 patients of group B (32%) complained of anterior knee pain 
(mean NRS 7.1 ± 1.7). At 2-year follow-up, pain significantly decreased (NRS 3.1 
± 2.1) and only 4 of the 16 patients (25%) complained of moderate anterior pain 
(average NRS 5.7 ± 0.5), while 8 of 16 (50%) patients reported discomfort (mean 
NRS 3.5 ± 1.8) around the patella. Patients in group A also demonstrated a 
significant decrease in pain intensity (from NRS 1.5 ± 1.4 preoperatively to NRS 
0.4 ± 1.5 at 2-year follow-up). Statistical analysis demonstrated no 
statistically significant correlation between pre-arthrotomy/post-arthrotomy 
patellar blood flow and the presence of preoperative and postoperative anterior 
knee pain. Only the degree of flexion had an influence on patellar blood flow.
CONCLUSION: Medial arthrotomy had no direct significant effect on patellar blood 
flow, and the diminished blood flow did not correlate with postoperative 
anterior knee pain. However, a significant correlation was revealed between 
patellar blood flow and the degree of flexion: in almost a quarter of patients, 
blood flow dropped to zero at flexions of 100° and above.

(1)Orthopaedic Hospital of Invalid Foundation, Helsinki, Finland.

Recent reports on the outcome of sports injuries have pointed out that ankle 
sprains may cause long term discomfort, this occasionally being due to peroneal 
tendon dislocation which may become chronic. The present paper reports a method, 
which includes deepening of the retromalleolar groove and at the same time 
maintaining the cartilagenous gliding layer. Long term follow-up (2 to 10 years) 
is presented on four patients. One of the patients returned successfully to 
international track and road races. In each case, the clinical result after the 
operation was successful, the ankles showing normal biomechanical functions.

PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate 
the outcomes of syndesmotic screw fixation versus suture button fixation in the 
treatment of distal tibiofibular syndesmosis injury from the current literature.
METHODS: The electronic literature database of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
library were searched in August 2018. The data on medial clear space, 
tibiofibular clear space, tibiofibular overlap, American Orthopaedic Foot and 
Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores and complications (including wound infection, local 
irritation or discomfort, screw loosening and screw breakage) were extracted. 
Stata 14.0 software was used for our meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies including 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
and 6 cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis showed that 
there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding medial 
clear space (P = 0.54), tibiofibular clear space (P = 0.23) and tibiofibular 
overlap (P = 0.88) postoperatively. However, the present meta-analysis 
demonstrated that the suture button fixation group had significantly higher 
AOFAS scores than the syndesmotic screw fixation group at 3rd, 6th, 12th and 
24th months postoperatively (P = 0.001, P = 0.006, P = 0.000 and P = 0.049 
respectively). Besides, the time to full weight bearing in the suture button 
fixation group was significantly earlier than that in the syndesmotic screw 
fixation group (P = 0.000). As for the complications, the suture button fixation 
group had a lower rate of post-operative complication (screw loosening and screw 
breakage) compared with the syndesmotic screw fixation group (P = 0.048 and 
P = 0.000 respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggested that suture button fixation could 
achieve significant higher AOFAS scores with a lower rate of postoperative 
complications and earlier time to full weight bearing in distal tibiofibular 
syndesmosis injury. More RCTs are required for further research.

Treatment for partial tears of the lateral ligament of the ankle: a prospective 
trial.

Brooks SC, Potter BT, Rainey JB.

There is debate about the most appropriate form of treatment for partial tears 
of the lateral ligament of the ankle, which are common after inversion injuries. 
A prospective trial of four forms of treatment was carried out. The forms of 
treatment used were: no treatment with only a minimal bandage, Tubigrip support, 
immobilisation in plaster-of-Paris, and physiotherapy. The end point was taken 
when the patient returned to work or had a low score on an objective clinical 
scale. Early mobilisation, with or without physiotherapy, was found to offer the 
most rapid return to functional activity. Patients who had had their ankle 
immobilised in plaster-of-Paris required more days off work and longer 
attendance at a follow-up clinic. Inversion injuries are common and cause 
absence from work and discomfort for the patient. These findings suggest that 
mobilisation with physiotherapy, although not practical for all patients, is the 
most satisfactory course of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Bucket-handle meniscus tears (BHMT) are often displaced and 
unstable. The inside-out technique of repairing such tears is currently the gold 
standard. All-inside repair with meniscal fixators is getting increasingly 
popular. Shortcomings of the inside-out technique include neurovascular 
complications, especially saphenous nerve palsy, and retention of a 
non-resorbable suture which can result in discomfort to patient, granuloma 
formation, and a foci of infection. Hence, the purpose of this project was to 
innovate a novel all-inside technique to precisely reduce and fix BHMT while 
avoiding neurovascular complications and retention of a non-resorbable suture.
METHODS: Routine arthroscopic portals were created on a patient's left knee with 
a displaced BHMT. Through the anteromedial portal, a conjoint pseudo double 
lumen cannula was inserted. Two limbs of a reduction suture were passed through 
the cannula, one over the "femoral" surface of the meniscus, one over the 
"tibial" surface of the meniscus anterior to the biceps femoris tendon, with the 
knee flexed at 20° to avoid injury to the saphenous nerve. Suture limbs were 
passed out percutaneously and tensioned.
RESULTS: Anatomic reduction was ensured under arthroscopic visualization with 
ease. All inside repair was performed using the vertical mattress suture 
configuration. Reduction sutures were subsequently removed by cutting flush to 
the skin and pulling on one suture limb. The patient was back to full activities 
with minimal discomfort 8 months post-operatively.
CONCLUSION: The technique described is superior to existing techniques for the 
following reasons: (1) Reduction of the displaced meniscal tear is 
"extra-meniscal," avoiding further trauma to a damaged meniscus. (2) Tensioning 
of the two suture limbs created promotes better control of reduction through 
tensioning. (3) Risk of discomfort, infection, and neurovascular damage caused 
by a retained suture is reduced. (4) No additional portals/equipment is 
required. We encourage this novel technique to be attempted by surgeons.

Shoulder strain is a major limiting factor associated with load carriage. 
Despite advances in backpack designs, there are still reports of shoulder 
discomfort, loss of sensorimotor functions, and brachial plexus syndrome. The 
current study is aimed at characterizing mechanical loading conditions (strains 
and stresses) that develop within the shoulder's soft tissues when carrying a 
backpack. Open MRI scans were used for reconstructing a three-dimensional 
geometrical model of an unloaded shoulder and for measuring the soft tissue 
deformations caused by a 25-kg backpack; subsequently, a subject-specific finite 
element (FE) model for nonlinear, large-deformation stress-strain analyses was 
developed. Skin pressure distributions under the backpack strap were used as 
reference data and for verifying the numerical solutions. The parameters of the 
model were adjusted to fit the calculated tissue deformations to those obtained 
by MRI. The MRI scans revealed significant compression of the soft tissues of 
the shoulder, with substantial deformations in the area of the subclavian muscle 
and the brachial plexus. The maximal pressure values exerted by a 25-kg load 
were substantial and reached ∼90 kPa. In the muscle surrounding the brachial 
plexus, the model predicted maximal compressive strain of 0.14 and maximal 
tensile strain of 0.13, which might be injurious for the underlying neural 
tissue. In conclusion, the FE model provided some insights regarding the 
potential mechanisms underlying brachial plexus injuries related to load 
carriage. The large tissue deformations and pressure hotspots that were observed 
are likely to result in tissue damage, which may hamper neural function if 
sustained for long time exposures.

resistance assessments of the posterior hip and thigh muscles.

CONTEXT: Passive straight-legged-raise (SLR) assessments have been performed 
with the ankle fixed in dorsiflexion (DF), plantar-flexion (PF), or neutral 
(NTRL) position. However, it is unclear whether ankle position contributes to 
differences in the passive resistance measured during an SLR assessment.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of ankle position during an SLR on the 
passive torque, range of motion (ROM), and hamstrings electromyographic (EMG) 
responses to passive stretch of the posterior hip and thigh muscles.
DESIGN: Crossover study.
SETTING: Research laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 healthy volunteers (5 men: age = 
24 ± 3 years, height = 178 ± 6 cm, mass = 85 ± 10 kg; 8 women: age = 21 ± 1 
years, height = 163 ± 8 cm, mass = 60 ± 6 kg).
INTERVENTION(S): Participants performed 6 randomly ordered passive SLR 
assessments involving 2 assessments at each condition, which included the ankle 
positioned in DF, PF, and NTRL. All SLRs were performed using an isokinetic 
dynamometer programmed in passive mode to move the limb toward the head at 5°/s.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): During each SLR, maximal ROM was determined as the 
point of discomfort but not pain, as indicated by the participant. Passive 
torque and EMG amplitude were determined at 4 common joint angles (θ) separated 
by 5° during the final common 15° of ROM for each participant.
RESULTS: Passive torque was greater for the DF condition than the NTRL (P = 
.008) and PF (P = .03) conditions at θ3 and greater for the DF than NTRL 
condition (P = .02) at θ4. Maximal ROM was lower for the DF condition than the 
NTRL (P = .003) and PF (P < .001) conditions. However, we found no differences 
among conditions for EMG amplitude (P = .86).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that performing SLRs with the ankle 
positioned in DF may elicit greater passive torque and lower ROM than SLRs with 
the ankle positioned in PF or NTRL. The greater passive torque and lower ROM 
induced by the DF condition possibly were due to increased tension in the neural 
structures of the proximal thigh.

BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) can lead to pain and loss 
of function of the hip joint, which places a great burden on patients and 
society. Surgery is the main treatment for osteonecrosis of the femoral head, 
and quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting has a definite therapeutic 
effect as one method of surgery for the treatment of ONFH. However, the 
posterior superior retinacular artery is often injured during quadratus femoris 
muscle pedicle bone graft surgery. There is evidence that this artery is 
extremely important to the femoral head, as injury to this artery will seriously 
affect the blood supply of the femoral head. Therefore, this situation restricts 
the clinical application of quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafts. We 
aimed to explore a new surgical method of quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone 
grafting that can preserve the integrity of the posterior superior retinacular 
artery.
METHODS: We modified the traditional quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft 
and preserved the integrity of the posterior superior retinacular artery. To 
explore the safety and feasibility of the operation, we simulated the operation 
on 6 fresh frozen cadavers (12 hips) and measured the related data. We also 
tried this modified surgical method in the clinic and collected detailed data 
from the patients.
RESULTS: By simulating the modified quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft 
on the hip joints of fresh frozen cadavers, we found that the posterior superior 
retinacular artery existed in all cadaver specimens and that the sources may be 
different (MFCA or IGA). In the modified operation, the joint capsule did not 
need to be cut during the operation; therefore, the integrity of the posterior 
superior retinacular artery was preserved. The quadratus femoris muscle was 
exposed via the posterior approach of the hip joint, and then the quadratus 
femoris muscle pedicle bone flap was chiseled. After the pedicle of the 
quadratus femoris muscle was loosened properly, the migration distance of the 
quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone flap reached 5.89 ± 0.45 (χ ± s) cm. The 
bone flap was trimmed properly and placed on one side. Next, we drilled a bone 
tunnel from the external intertrochanteric aspect of the capsule of the hip 
joint, and the bone tunnel broke through the sclerosing zone and proceeded 
straight to the necrotic area of the femoral head. Next, the necrotic bone was 
removed with a ring saw and arc bone knife, autogenous bone or allogeneic bone 
was filled into the bone groove according to the situation, and the cancellous 
bone in the bone groove was tamped by percussion. Then, the bone flap was 
inserted into the bone groove, and appropriate pressurization was performed. The 
depth of the bone groove was determined by the location of ONFH. We found that 
the furthest distance between the bone groove and the femoral head was 
4.76 ± 0.07 (χ ± s) cm and that the length of the bone flap was (4.91 ± 0.23) 
(χ ± s) cm. This means that when the depth of the bone groove reached the area 
of ONFH, the quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone flap had a sufficient length 
and migration distance to be embedded in the area of ONFH and firmly fixed, and 
the quadratus femoris did not have much tension. The closest distance between 
the posterior superior retinacular artery and the bone groove was (1.11 ± 0.96) 
(χ ± s) cm. When the bone groove was created in this area, the edge of the bone 
groove had a safe distance of at least 1 cm from the posterior superior 
retinacular artery of the femoral head. We attempted to implement this modified 
operation clinically. During the procedure, the quadratus femoris muscle pedicle 
bone flap was embedded into the drilled bone groove and fixed with a magnesium 
nail. There was no sliding of the bone flap after the operation, and the 
posterior superior retinacular artery was intact. We followed the patient for 
3 months and found that the patient recovered well with no weight-bearing by the 
affected limb. The duration of the modified operation was shorter than that of 
the traditional quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft, the amount of 
bleeding was significantly reduced, the postoperative pain was lessened, and no 
special discomfort was reported. Postoperative imaging examination showed that 
the collapse of the femoral head had been partially corrected and that the bone 
flap had gradually fused with the surrounding bone.
CONCLUSIONS: Through this experimental study, we confirmed the feasibility of 
the modified method for quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting with 
preservation of the posterior superior retinacular artery. This modified 
operation not only retains the integrity of the posterior superior retinacular 
artery of the femoral head but also reduces the difficulty of the operation and 
shortens the surgical time, which is of great clinical significance.

Radiotherapy, when used in head and neck cancer treatment, can produce side 
effects in the patients, such as decreased salivary production, xerostomia, 
opportunistic infections, radiation caries, dysphagia, local discomfort and the 
limitation of mouth opening. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amplitude 
of mouth opening in patients before and immediately after the completion of 
radiotherapy, comparing the effectiveness of two physiotherapy exercises. The 
irradiated sites included the masticatory muscles. The results demonstrated that 
there were no statistically significant differences between the two instituted 
exercises; however there was a trend towards better clinical results in group 2. 
The amplitude of mouth opening showed a trend towards reduction, but this was 
not statistically significant. When the pterygoid and sternocleidomatoid muscles 
were included in the irriated field, patients were observed to have more 
morbidity. This indicates the great importance of these muscles in mouth 
opening. Based on the results obtained within this study, it is not possible to 
conclude that physiotherapy exercies are efficacious in preventing trismus. 
Future longitudinal studies are required to verify the onset of trismus in 
radiotherapy patients.

The condition known as tendonitis, tennis elbow, lateral epicondylalgia, or 
lateral epicondylitis affects the radiohumeral joint and causes persistent, 
severe discomfort in the elbow. It commonly affects those who work in 
professions that need repetitive forearm motions, like athletes who play on 
courts, computer operators, and woodworkers. It tends to originate from 
additional rapid, tiresome, recurring eccentric contractions and activities that 
grab gliding joints. It commonly affects the dominant hand. This case report 
describes the author's seven years of experience living with lateral 
epicondylitis, including functional disability in day-to-day life, and then 
physiotherapy management was started. Mill's and Cozen's tests were performed, 
and lateral epicondylitis was confirmed. From 2023, the physiotherapy session, 
including active release technique and conventional therapy, was taken regularly 
for four weeks. The outcome measure score of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was 
7/10 pre-treatment and 2/10 post-treatment, and for the Patient-Rated Tennis 
Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) scale, it was 50/100 pre-treatment and 25/100 
post-treatment. The results that are reported from this particular case study 
suggest that physiotherapy has a significant effect in improving muscle 
strength, increasing range of motion, improving activities of daily living, and 
enhancing the overall quality of life. The study concludes a physiotherapist is 
crucial in treating these overuse injuries and returning the patient to their 
daily activities.

Untreated venous insufficiency results not only in a gradual loss of cosmesis 
but also in variety of complications including persistent pain and discomfort, 
hemorrhage, superficial thrombophlebitis, and progressive skin changes that may 
ultimately lead to ulceration. In rare instances, chronic soft tissue changes 
may lead to stiffness of the ankle joint, fixed plantar flexion, and 
periostitis. This article reviews the variety of complications caused by venous 
insufficiency.

Irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation represent a relevant and 
common health issue. However, real-world clinical practice includes patients 
with constipation who may or may not have other abdominal complaints (pain, 
bloating, abdominal discomfort) with variable frequency. The goal of the present 
study was to obtain information on the workload entailed by patients with 
constipation and associated abdominal complaints, predominant clinical 
behaviors, education needs, and potential daily practice aids both in Primary 
Care and gastroenterology settings. The clinical behavior of doctors is 
generally similar at both levels, despite differences in healthcare approach: 
use of empiric therapies and clinically guided diagnostic tests, with some 
differences in colonoscopy use (not always directly accessible from Primary 
Care). Regarding perceptions, general support and osmotic laxatives are most 
valued by PC doctors, whereas osmotic laxatives, combined laxatives, and 
linaclotide are most valued by GE specialists. Furthermore, over half of 
respondents considered differentiating both diagnoses as challenging. Finally, 
considerable education needs are self-acknowledged at both levels, as is a 
demand for guidelines and protocols to help in managing this issue in clinical 
practice. A strength of this study is its providing a joint photograph of the 
medical approach and the perceptions of constipation with abdominal discomfort 
from a medical standpoint. Weaknesses include self-declaration (no formal 
validation) and a response rate potentially biased by professional motivation.

INTRODUCTION: Metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis of the great toe (hallux 
rigidus) is a frequent condition for which numerous surgical techniques have 
been proposed. The most used ones are cheilectomy and arthrodesis. The 
objectives of this retrospective study are to present the midterm results of the 
Valenti procedure and to compare these results with those from other recognized 
surgical techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a continuous 
group of 32 patients (41 cases) presenting hallux rigidus and treated using the 
Valenti technique from November 1999 to July 2004. The mean age of these 
patients at the time of surgery was 57 years. Forty-one percent of these 
patients also presented a static disorder of the foot. One or several additional 
procedures were undertaken, at the time of surgery, in 24% of these cases. 
Patients were assessed using the AOFAS score completed by the walking distance 
test, the gait test, the tiptoe test and self-evaluation of patient 
satisfaction. The radiographic work-up before surgery and at follow-up showed 
the progression of the joint space changes and allowed us to evaluate plantar 
subluxation at the base of the first phalanx under the metatarsal head.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (32 cases) were reviewed and evaluated with a mean 
follow-up of 5.5 years. Two cases of reflex sympathetic dystrophy were observed 
as complications. The mean final score was 81 out of 100 from a preoperative 
score of 47 out of 100. Pain was absent or only occasional in 94% of the cases. 
Discomfort wearing shoes was absent or moderate in 91% of the cases. Joint range 
of movement was greater than 30 degrees in 72% of the cases and the toes were 
stable. Walking distance was unlimited in 79% of the cases. A mean 30% plantar 
subluxation at the base of the first phalanx was noted at follow-up, with no 
clinical consequence. The results were comparable irrelevantly of the hallux 
rigidus grade being treated.
DISCUSSION: The numerous techniques proposed achieve comparable results both in 
terms of pain relief and functional result but each one has its own limitations. 
Only arthroplasties with silastic implants and the Keller technique give less 
satisfactory results. Arthrodesis remains the first-choice treatment for 
advanced hallux rigidus but failure is possible in case of technical error or 
malunion. Cheilectomy, a conservative intervention, is ideal for lesions that 
are not too advanced or remain limited to the dorsal part of the joint; this 
conservative option presents generally no specific complications. Prosthetic 
replacement--with, to date, little long-term experience for total 
arthroplasty--remains controversial because the results deteriorate over time. 
The Valenti procedure exposes the patient to a possible risk of 
metatarsophalangeal joint destabilization if the resection is too great, but 
this does not impair the final functional outcome.
CONCLUSION: The arthrectomy described by Valenti is a highly reproducible 
intervention. We find it to be a good compromise between mobility and stability, 
providing good results for all hallux rigidus grades and entailing a low 
complication rate.

Below knee amputation remains the treatment of choice for most patients with 
aggressive tumours of the distal tibia. We report the clinical and functional 
outcome of limb preserving surgery and endoprosthetic reconstruction of the 
distal tibia and ankle joint in five patients who declined amputation. The mean 
age was 32 years. Two had osteosarcoma, one Ewing's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and 
Giant cell tumour. Three patients developed significant complications including 
local recurrence, wound dehiscence and infection, and fibula impingement. 
Despite these complications the patients declined amputation even in the 
presence of significant discomfort. Early function was excellent in all patients 
but deteriorated with time. The patients still maintained an Enneking Score of 
more than 50%. Some patients are unwilling to undergo amputation for aggressive 
tumours of the distal tibia. For these, excision and reconstruction with 
endoprosthesis allow early functional recovery but there is significant medium 
term morbidity and functional deterioration.

L’amputation au dessous du genou reste le traitement de choix pour la plupart 
des patients présentant des tumeurs agressives au niveau de l’extrémité distale 
du tibia. Nous rapportons ici les résultats cliniques et fonctionnels de 5 
patients qui, ayant refusé toute amputation à ce niveau, ont bénéficié d’une 
chirurgie conservatrice et d’une reconstruction prothétique de l’extrémité 
inférieure du tibia et de la cheville. L’âge moyen était de 32 ans. Deux 
patients présentaient un ostéosarcome; les autres présentaient un sarcome 
d’Ewing, un leiomyo-sarcome et une tumeur à cellules géantes. Trois patients ont 
présenté des complications sérieuses: récidive locale, désunion et infection, 
conflit au niveau de la fibula. Malgré ces complications aux conséquences 
fonctionnelles lourdes, tous les patients ont refusé l’amputation. Le résultat 
fonctionnel précoce a été excellent pour tous les patients mais s’est détérioré 
avec le temps. Certains patients refusent de subir une amputation pour une 
tumeur agressive de l’extrémité inférieure du tibia. Pour ces patients, 
l’excision et la reconstruction à l’aide d’endo-prothèses permettent d’obtenir 
un bon résultat fonctionnel précoce cependant la morbidité ainsi que la 
détérioration fonctionnelle avec le temps reste importante.

Mycobacterium terrae is ubiquitous in our environment. M terrae infections most 
commonly involve tendon sheaths, bones, bursae, and joints. We report a case of 
infectious arthritis of the knee caused by M terrae in a 21-year-old man who had 
non-specific chronic synovitis. No organism was seen on microscopy or isolated 
from cultures until months later. Initially the M terrae culture was considered 
a contaminant and specific anti-mycobacterial treatment was not advised. The 
patient was commenced on suppressive therapy for persistent effusion and 
discomfort. Eventually, the M terrae infection was confirmed and he was 
commenced on clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ethambutol. The triple 
antibiotic regimen was continued for 2 years. The knee improved but never 
completely settled. The patient chose to cease all antibiotic medication. The 
knee remained swollen and irritable, with little chance of eradicating the 
organism.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional effects 
of temporalis myofascial flap after condylectomy, with or without disc removal, 
in elderly patients with anterior disc displacement (ADD) without reduction and 
an erosive condylar surface of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
METHODS: A total of 15 joints from 11 elderly patients (71-78 years old) were 
included. The patients had pain, mandibular dysfunction symptoms, and unilateral 
or bilateral ADD as well as an erosive condylar surface of the TMJ. All patients 
underwent temporalis myofascial flap reconstruction after condylectomy, with or 
without disc removal. If the maximal mouth opening (MMO) remained <35 mm after 
condylectomy, coronoidotomy was also performed. Self-assessed pain and 
mandibular function, including MMO and protrusive and lateral movements, were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: No patient experienced serious complications. Most measurements 
improved significantly after surgery compared to preoperatively. Most patients 
achieved nearly-normal mouth opening at 4 weeks after surgery. Although most 
patients felt discomfort during active postoperative physiotherapy, no patient 
reported serious pain during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Although nonsurgical therapy is often the first treatment choice for 
ADD without reduction of the TMJ, surgical intervention involving condylectomy 
and temporalis myofascial flap reconstruction may be a reasonable first option 
for elderly patients with an erosive condylar surface of the TMJ.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 
using the Genesis II posterior stabilized prosthesis with a high-flex insert 
during the mid-term follow-up and to assess its effect on the Japanese 
lifestyle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients (8 men and 45 women) 
underwent primary TKA. The mean follow-up time was 76 months (5-9 years). 
Clinical results were assessed with the Japanese Orthopedic Association 
osteoarthritis knee rating score (JOA knee score), range of motion, and 
lifestyle changes.
RESULTS: The postoperative JOA knee score improved significantly compared to the 
preoperative JOA knee score. The mean preoperative flexion range improved from 
112° to 123° postoperatively (p < 0.05). Additionally, our findings showed that 
39% of patients enjoyed a floor-sitting life preoperatively, but only 30% of 
patients enjoyed floor-sitting life postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: The postoperative range of knee motion and JOA knee score improved 
after TKA using the Genesis II posterior stabilized prosthesis with a high-flex 
insert, but the number of patients who enjoyed floor-sitting life decreased from 
39% to 30% because of feelings of fear and discomfort.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the characteristics of deep venous flow in the 
leg in a cast and the effects of a wearable neuromuscular stimulator (geko; 
FirstKind Ltd) and also to explore the participants' tolerance of the 
stimulator.
METHODS: This is an open-label physiological study on ten healthy volunteers. 
Duplex ultrasonography of the superficial femoral vein measured normal flow and 
cross-sectional area in the standing and supine positions (with the lower limb 
initially horizontal and then elevated). Flow measurements were repeated during 
activation of the geko stimulator placed over the peroneal nerve. The process 
was repeated after the application of a below-knee cast. Participants evaluated 
discomfort using a questionnaire (verbal rating score) and a scoring index 
(visual analogue scale).
RESULTS: The geko device was effective in significantly increasing venous blood 
flow in the lower limb both with a plaster cast (mean difference 11.5 
cm/sec(-1); p = 0.001 to 0.13) and without a plaster cast (mean difference 7.7 
cm/sec(-1); p = 0.001 to 0.75). Posture also had a significant effect on peak 
venous blood flow when the cast was on and the geko inactive (p = 0.003 to 
0.69), although these differences were less pronounced than the effect of the 
geko (mean difference 3.1 cm/sec(-1) (-6.5 to 10)). The geko device was well 
tolerated, with participants generally reporting only mild discomfort using the 
device.
CONCLUSION: The geko device increases venous blood flow in the lower limb, 
offering a potential mechanical thromboprolylaxis for patients in a cast. Cite

Adult acquired flexible flatfoot, treated by calcaneocuboid distraction 
arthrodesis, posterior tibial tendon augmentation, and percutaneous Achilles 
tendon lengthening: a prospective outcome study of 20 patients.

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Several methods for the treatment of acquired flexible flatfoot have 
been described.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We followed the outcome of calcaneocuboid distraction 
arthrodesis with lengthening of the lateral column prospectively in 20 patients 
(20 feet). The mean age of the patients was 55 (30-66) years and 16 were women. 
The lateral column lengthening was combined with percutaneous lengthening of the 
Achilles tendon and augmentation of the posterior tibial tendon in all patients. 
Fixed forefoot supination, hallux valgus, and/or symptomatic arthrosis, were 
corrected with arthrodesis of the first cuneiform-metatarsal joint (n = 8) and 
arthrodesis of the naviculocuneiform joint (n = 2). The Foot Function Index 
(FFI) and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Clinical Rating 
Index hindfoot score (CRI) were completed preoperatively and at follow-up. 
Follow-up time was 25 (13-39) months. All patients were physically examined at 
follow-up at the outpatient clinic, and the overall satisfaction rate was 
registered. Standardized weight-bearing radiographs were taken preoperatively 
and at follow-up. The lateral and dorsoplantar talometatarsal angle was 
measured, together with the ground-navicular distance.
RESULTS: At follow-up, 17/20 feet had complete relief of pain or only minor 
symptoms. The overall patient satisfaction rate was excellent or good in 15 
patients and 17 patients reported an increase in daily and/or recreational 
activities. 3 patients complained of pain at the distraction site and/or 
cuboid-MT5 joint, without signs of arthrosis. All but 1 patient would have 
chosen to undergo the same procedure given the same circumstances. The 
improvement in both the FFI and CRI was statistically significant. On 
radiographic examination, the lateral and dorsoplantar talometatarsal angle and 
the ground-navicular distance improved significantly. Nonunion developed in 2 
patients and united after bone grafting. 3 patients had either paresthesia or 
anesthesia in the distribution area of the sural nerve.
INTERPRETATION: We found good short-term results after calcaneocuboid 
distraction arthrodesis, percutaneous tendon Achilles lengthening, and medial 
soft tissue augmentation for the treatment of degenerative/acquired flexible 
flatfoot. Pain or discomfort along the lateral aspect of the foot is the most 
common and worrying postoperative complaint.

Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of varying interdental bite platform 
thickness of the scuba mouthpiece on airway efficiency.
METHODS: 10 male divers had their mean peak flow measured for free breathing, 
maximum flow with diving mouthpiece, teeth in occlusion, and for five 
experimental mouthpieces with different thickness of interdental bite platform 
(1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm).
RESULTS: The connecting airway between the demand valve and mouthpiece was found 
to be a major limiting factor in airway efficiency. An interdental bite platform 
of 4 mm resulted in the greatest air flow with a further increase in thickness 
resulting in air flow restriction.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of an interdental bite platform of 4 mm placed between the 
premolar and molar teeth ensures the greatest airway efficiency and also results 
in a design which provides the least temporomandibular joint discomfort for the 
diver.

Comparison of outcome of unilateral locking plate and dual plating in the 
treatment of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures.

Lee MH, Hsu CJ, Lin KC, Renn JH.

BACKGROUND: Tibial plateau fracture (TPF) includes different fracture patterns 
with varied degrees of articular depression and displacement. Many kinds of 
fixators, including newly designed plate with locking screws, were applied to 
treat these complicated fractures. We intended to follow up the surgical 
outcomes of (1) unilateral locking plate, (2) classic dual plates, or (3) hybrid 
dual plates for TPF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 76 patients with TPF, 
Schatzker types V and VI, who we operated from June 2006 to May 2009 in our 
institute. Excluding patients who expired due to other medical conditions and 
without complete follow-up, 45 patients were sorted out in this series. The 
scheme of surgical intervention was designed by visiting staff, and 15 patients, 
as group I, were treated with unilateral locking plate. The other 19 patients, 
as group II, were treated with classic dual plates. The residual 11 patients, as 
group III, were treated with hybrid dual plates (one lateral approach locking 
compression plate (LCP) + medial anti-gliding plate). All patients were under 
periodic F/U at about 6 weeks interval for at least 18 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: In group I, 13 cases achieved solid bony union without obvious 
traumatic OA change, limitation of ROM, or malalignment. In groups II and III, 
15 and 10 patients reached the same goal, respectively. By analysis of the 
recorded parameters with statistical software (SPSS 12.0), there were five 
parameters with significant difference, including Schatzker classification, 
operation time, staged treatment or not, hospitalization period, and hardware 
impingement.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant statistical difference of union rate 
between these three groups in our series. Based on our clinical follow-up, 
several key points were emphasized: (1) Soft tissue problems should be kept in 
mind, and usage of locking plate can reduce the discomfort of hardware 
impingement effectively. (2) The single lateral approach technique for TPF with 
locking plate results in less operation time and shorter hospitalization period. 
(3) If the medial buttress cannot be established by reduction of the lateral 
fracture, then open reduction of the medial side is necessary and buttresses the 
medial fragment by dual plates.

Accessory ossicles are developmental variants which are often asymptomatic. When 
incidentally picked up on imaging, they are often inconsequential and rarely a 
cause for concern. However, they may cause pain or discomfort due to trauma, 
altered stress, and over-activity. Nuclear scintigraphy may play a role in the 
diagnosis and localizing pain generators. 18F-Sodium Fluoride (NaF) is a PET 
imaging agent used in bone imaging. Although commonly used in imaging patients 
with cancer imaging malignancy, 18F-NaF may be useful in the evaluation of 
benign bone and joint conditions. In this article, we would like to present a 
spectrum of clinical cases and review the potential diagnostic utility of 
18F-NaF in the assessment of symptomatic accessory ossicles in patients referred 
for staging cancers.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if altering the foot progression angle (FPA) by varying 
magnitudes during gait alters the external knee adduction moment (KAM), knee 
flexion moment (KFM), knee extension moment (KEM) and/or symptoms in people with 
medial knee osteoarthritis (OA). Potential influence of pain and knee 
malalignment on load-modifying effects of FPA was investigated.
DESIGN: Participants (n = 22) underwent 3-dimensional gait analysis to measure 
KAM peaks, KAM impulse, KFM and KEM peaks. Following natural gait, five altered 
FPA conditions were performed in random order (10° toe-in, 0° FPA, 10° toe-out, 
20° toe-out and 30° toe-out). A projection screen displayed their real-time FPA. 
Pain/discomfort at knees and feet/ankles were evaluated for each condition. 
Linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Toe-in reduced the early stance peak KAM and KEM but increased the KAM 
impulse, late stance peak and KFM. Toe-out reduced the KAM impulse, late stance 
peak and KFM (P < 0.001) but increased the early stance peak KAM and KEM. All 
effects were greater in participants with more varus knees. Pain significantly 
mediated the effect of altered FPA on the KAM impulse and late stance peak. In 
more painful individuals, toe-in was predicted to reduce the KAM impulse and 
late stance peak, and increase them for toe-out gait. There were no immediate 
symptomatic changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Effects of altered FPA vary across all medial knee load parameters 
and it is difficult to determine an optimal direction of FPA change. Future 
studies should consider Western Ontario McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC) 
pain to judge the likely effects of altered FPA.

We report a case of isolated rupture of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) of 
the knee while attempting to place the left foot behind the head during yoga 
practice. The 34-year-old man had discomfort of the lateral aspect of the knee 
particularly with varus strain. A magnetic resonance image revealed rupture of 
the LCL at the insertion onto the fibula. The patient had grade-II laxity of the 
LCL and was treated non-operatively. At the 12-month follow-up, grade-I laxity 
of the LCL remained clinically evident, but function was not impaired.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the relation between handball playing, passive hip range 
of motion (ROM), and the development of radiological hip osteoarthritis (OA) in 
former elite handball players. Two related issues are addressed: (a) the 
relation between long term elite handball playing and the incidence of hip OA; 
(b) the relations between hip ROM, OA, and pain.
METHODS: Data on 20 former elite handball players and 39 control subjects were 
collected. A questionnaire yielded personal details, loading patterns during 
physical activity, and previous lower limb joint injury. Bilateral radiographs 
were analysed to diagnose and classify hip OA. Passive hip ROM was measured 
bilaterally with a goniometer.
RESULTS: A close relation was found between long term elite handball practice 
and the incidence of hip OA: 60% of the handball players were diagnosed with OA 
in at least one of the hip joints compared with 13% of the control subjects. 
Passive ROM measured in the handball players was significantly lower for hip 
flexion and medial rotation and higher for abduction, extension, and lateral 
rotation than the control values. The handball players with OA reported less 
pain in the hip joints during daily activities than the control subjects with 
OA.
CONCLUSION: The risk of developing premature hip OA seems high for retired 
handball players and significantly greater than for the general population. Pain 
and discomfort represent two difficult diagnostic challenges to the sports 
physician, as the repetitive nature of movements that are specific to handball 
can lead to alterations that are rarely seen in the general population.

Neer modification of open Bankart procedure: what are the rates of recurrent 
instability, functional outcome, and arthritis?

Boileau P(1), Fourati E, Bicknell R.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Traumatology, Hôpital de 
L'Archet, University of Nice, Nice, France.

BACKGROUND: Neer modified the Bankart procedure by combining a superoinferior 
capsular shift with the labral reattachment. The theoretical advantages of the 
modification were that such a procedure would restore the patient's anatomy and 
also treat the repeated capsular stretching encountered in anteroinferior 
instability without limiting external rotation and, thereby reducing the risk of 
arthritis.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore determined: (1) the rate of recurrent 
instability after this modification, (2) patient function, and (3) the incidence 
and stage of glenohumeral osteoarthritis at greater than 2 years followup in 
patients with traumatic anteroinferior instability.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all 64 patients (average age, 27 years) who 
had the modified Bankart procedure for recurrent dislocations (n = 39) or 
subluxation (n = 25) from 1991 to 1997. The labrum was reattached with suture 
anchors and a superoinferior capsular shift was added. We determined the rate of 
recurrent instability, Rowe and Walch-Duplay scores and shoulder ROM, and the 
presence of glenohumeral osteoarthritis (modified Samilson and Prieto 
classification). The minimum followup was 24 months (median, 40 months; range, 
24-120 months).
RESULTS: Recurrent instability occurred in seven of the 64 patients (11%) at an 
average of 25 months postoperatively (range, 7 days to 6 years); in six patients 
the recurrence was associated with trauma; five of the six patients underwent 
reoperation with a Latarjet procedure. Eight additional patients (13%) presented 
with persistent shoulder apprehension or discomfort. The average Rowe score was 
83% (range, 20-100%) and average Walch-Duplay score 83% (range, 15-100%). 
However, only 36 of 64 (56%) patients could return to the same sport at the same 
level. The loss of external rotation was 13° compared with the contralateral 
side. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis incidence increased from 4% preoperatively to 
17% postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The open Bankart procedure modified by Neer provided high function 
scores but a relatively low rate of return to sport and high rate of recurrent 
instability. Our rate of recurrent instability, similar to that obtained with 
arthroscopic Bankart procedures, has prompted us to abandon the open procedure.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and possible effects of whole-body 
vibration (WBV) training on muscle strength and gait performance in people with 
late effects of polio.
DESIGN: A case-controlled pilot study with assessments before and after 
training.
SETTING: A university hospital rehabilitation department.
PARTICIPANTS: People (N=5; 3 men, 2 women; mean age, 64+/-6.7y; range, 55-71y) 
with clinically and electrophysiologically verified late effects of polio.
INTERVENTIONS: All participants underwent 10 sessions of supervised WBV training 
(standing with knees flexed 40 degrees -55 degrees up to 60 seconds per 
repetition and 10 repetitions per session twice weekly for 5 weeks).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Isokinetic and isometric knee muscle strength 
(dynamometer), and gait performance (Timed Up & Go, Comfortable Gait Speed, Fast 
Gait Speed, and six-minute walk tests).
RESULTS: All participants completed the 5 weeks of WBV training, with no 
discernible discomfort. No significant changes in knee muscle strength or gait 
performance were found after the WBV training period.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study did not show any significant improvements in knee 
muscle strength and gait performance following a standard protocol of WBV 
training. Thus, the results do not lend support to WBV training for people with 
late effects of polio.

The use of gravity or manual-stress radiographs in the assessment of 
supination-external rotation fractures of the ankle.

Supination-external rotation (SER) fractures of the ankle may present with a 
medial ligamentous injury that is not apparent on the initial radiographs. A 
cadaver gravity-stress view has been described, but the manual-stress view is 
considered to be the examination of choice for the diagnosis of medial injuries. 
We prospectively compared the efficacy of these two examinations. We undertook 
both examinations in 29 patients with SER fractures. Of these, 16 (55%) were 
stress-positive, i.e. and had widening of the medial clear space of > 4 mm with 
a mean medial clear space of 6.09 mm (4.4 to 8.1) on gravity-stress and 5.81 mm 
(4.0 to 8.2) on manual-stress examination, and 13 patients (45%) were 
stress-negative with a mean medial clear space of 3.91 mm (3.3 to 5.1) and 3.61 
mm (2.6 to 4.5) on examination of gravity- and manual-stress respectively. The 
mean absolute visual analgoue scale score for discomfort in the examination of 
gravity stress was 3.45 (1 to 6) and in the manual-stress procedure 6.14 (3 to 
10). We have shown that examination of gravity-stress is as reliable and 
perceived as more comfortable than that of manual stress. We recommend using it 
as the initial diagnostic screening examination for the detection of occult 
medial ligamentous injuries in SER fractures of the ankle.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic low back pain is a disabling phenomenon that can cause a 
severe reduction in quality of life, especially in elderly patients. Surgical 
treatment is sometimes a big challenge for these elderly patients. 
Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is an increasingly popular method for treating low 
back pain caused by facet syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
whether RF neurotomy is effective in terms of pain reduction and functional 
outcome in elderly patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients aged 80 years and older who had 
chronic mechanical low back pain were examined after they underwent RF heat 
lesion of the medial branch. Follow-up occurred 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after 
treatment. Pain was measured on the visual analog scale and functional outcome 
was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index.
RESULTS: After 1 month, 43 patients (74%) were satisfied with the results. After 
3 months, 38 patients (66%) had clinically significant pain relief. After 6 
months, 33 patients (57%) had pain relief, and at the 1-year follow-up, 30 
patients (52%) showed good results while 28 patients (48%) showed no effect. The 
Oswestry Disability Index score was substantially improved even after 1 year. 
Minor complications occurred in eleven patients (19%), who had transient 
discomfort and burning pain.
CONCLUSION: RF is a safe and partially effective procedure for treating elderly 
patients with mechanical back pain due to facet syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Stiffness in the shoulder is a frequent symptom associated with a 
number of clinical entities whose management remains inadequately defined.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study of 235 cases of stiffness in the 
shoulder compared six therapeutic techniques with a mean follow-up of 13 months 
(range, 3-28 months) (T1: 58 cases, conventional rehabilitation under the pain 
threshold, T2: 59 cases, self-rehabilitation over the pain threshold, T3: 31 
cases, T2 + supervision, T4: 11 cases, T1 + capsular distension, T5: 31 cases, 
T1 + locoregional anesthesia, T6: 45 cases, T1 + T5 + capsulotomy). The 
therapeutic power of each technique and its impact on the result were assessed 
at each self-rehabilitation and rehabilitation session during the first 6 weeks 
and then at 3 months, 6 months, and at the final revision depending on 
subjective criteria (pain, discomfort, and morale) and objective criteria 
(Constant score, goniometric measurements).
RESULTS: Conventional rehabilitation (T1) is less effective than 
self-rehabilitation over the pain threshold (T2 & T3) during the first 6 weeks 
(P<0.05). Self-rehabilitation stagnates between the 6th and 12th week except 
when it is supervised by a therapist (T3). Anesthesia (T4) and capsular 
distension (T5) do not lead to significantly different progression beyond 6 
months. Capsulotomy does not demonstrate greater therapeutic power but its 
failure rate (persisting stiffness at 1 year) is 0% versus 14-17% for the other 
techniques (P<0.05).
DISCUSSION: The techniques are complementary and therapeutic success stems from 
an algorithm adapted to the individual patient with, over the first 3 months, 
successive self-rehabilitation and conventional rehabilitation, possibly 
completed by capsular distension or anesthesia between the 3rd and 6th months. 
In case of failure at 6 months, endoscopic capsulotomy can be proposed. 
Therapeutic patient education and active participation are the key to treatment 
success or failure.

The outcome of arthroscopic medial release of 255 knees in 173 patients for 
varying grades of osteoarthritis involving the medial compartment is reported. 
All operations were performed by a single surgeon between January 2001 and May 
2003. The Knee Society score for pain and the patient's subjective satisfaction 
were used for the outcome evaluation. Overall, satisfactory outcome was reported 
for 197 knees (77.3%) and the mean Knee Society score for pain improved from 
17.6 (95% confidence interval, 16.7 to 18.5), pre-operatively to 39.4 (95% 
confidence interval, 37.9 to 41.1) (p < 0.001). There were minor manageable 
complications of persistent effusion in 16 knees and prolonged wound discomfort 
in 11. In total, 15 of the 21 knees with poor results were converted to total 
knee replacements and two other patients (three knees) were offered this option 
after a mean period of 16 months. Based on these observations arthroscopic 
medial release is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the medial 
compartment of the knee joint and can be expected to reduce the pain in the 
majority of patients for at least four years post-operatively.

Medical School, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefit of the first infliximab infusion on sleep 
disturbances in patients with RA Material and methods: Evaluation of RA 
activity, sleepiness (Epworth scale and multiple sleep latency test), alertness 
(steer clear test), and sleep structure (polysomnography) were conducted before 
and after the first infusion of infliximab in six female patients with RA.
RESULTS: The day after the first infliximab infusion, the mean (SD) number of 
tender (20 (2.4)) or swollen (15.3 (2)) joints and the morning stiffness (140 
(61.9) min) had not changed. There were significant improvements in the median 
number of total sleep stage transitions per hour (median (IR) before v after 
infusion: 20.5 (43) v 7.5 (6); Wilcoxon paired test, p = 0.014), median 
percentage of phase I+II (83.5 (8) v 54.5 (24); p = 0.023), percentage of REM 
stages (2 (10) v 11.5 (8); p = 0.014), median percentage sleep efficiency (44 
(22) v 75 (18); p = 0.014), median sleep latency (77.5 (150) v 25.5 (23) min; p 
= 0.023), and median number of hits in the steer clear test (48.5 (86) v 6 (45); 
p = 0.023). Neither objective nor subjective daytime sleepiness was noted. One 
obese patient had obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep and the alertness disturbances in RA improve with infliximab 
treatment. Improvement appears unrelated to joint discomfort amelioration but 
suggests a central effect through inhibition of circulating TNFalpha levels.

Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Stimulation-evoked discomfort secondary to ligamentum flavum 
stimulation (LFS) is a technological limitation of percutaneous spinal cord 
stimulator (SCS) lead implants. There is a paucity of literature describing the 
clinical presentation and time periods at which this side effect may present 
following insertion of cylindrical lead(s).
OBJECTIVE: To describe a series of 5 patients who presented at varying time 
periods after SCS lead placement with LFS.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: We performed a chart review of online medical records of patients with 
symptoms consistent with LFS at an academic interventional pain clinic 
identified over 7 consecutive years (2006 - 2013).
RESULTS: LFS most frequently presented within months of implantation of 
cylindrical leads. One patient complained of LFS during the temporary trial 
while another developed LFS after lead revision. All patients were successfully 
treated when paddle electrodes replaced percutaneous cylindrical leads.
CONCLUSION: LFS may present as a barrier to successful SCS treatment. Clinicians 
placing percutaneous SCS leads should be aware of the variable time course of 
LFS presentation. Paddle style electrodes seem to offer an enduring solution to 
LFS so that patients may continue to benefit from SCS therapy.

BACKGROUND: Anesthesia management for patients with severe ankylosing 
spondylitis scheduled for total hip arthroplasty is challenging due to a 
potential difficult airway and difficult neuraxial block. We report 4 cases with 
ankylosing spondylitis successfully managed with a combination of lumbar plexus, 
sacral plexus and T12 paravertebral block.
CASE PRESENTATION: Four patients were scheduled for total hip arthroplasty. All 
of them were diagnosed as severe ankylosing spondylitis with rigidity and 
immobilization of cervical and lumbar spine and hip joints. A combination of T12 
paravertebral block, lumbar plexus and sacral plexus block was successfully used 
for the surgery without any additional intravenous anesthetic or local 
anesthetics infiltration to the incision, and none of the patients complained of 
discomfort during the operations.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of T12 paravertebral block, lumbar plexus and 
sacral plexus block, which may block all nerves innervating the articular 
capsule, surrounding muscles and the skin involved in total hip arthroplasty, 
might be a promising alternative for total hip arthroplasty in ankylosing 
spondylitis.

The proximal phalangeal base is the most commonly fractured hand bone in 
children. Such fractures are rarely reported as irreducible due to flexor tendon 
entrapment. Here, we describe a patient who sustained a malunited fracture on 
the right fifth finger proximal phalanx with flexor tendon entrapment after 
treatment with closed reduction with K-wires fixation.A 13-year-old patient came 
to the clinic following a bicycle accident 6 weeks ago. He presented with 
flexion limitation in his small finger on the right hand. During physical 
examination, the patient felt no pain, and the neurovascular structures were 
intact. However range of motion (ROM) in his small finger was not normal. Plain 
radiographs displayed a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the small finger 
proximal phalanx base and volar angulation with callus formation. During the 
operation, it was established that the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) 
around the fracture had a severe adhesion, whereas the flexor digitorum 
profundus (FDP) was entrapped between the volarly displaced metaphyses and the 
epiphyses and united with the bone. We removed the volarly displaced metaphyses 
and freed FDP and repaired the A2 pulley. The bone was anatomically fixed with 
K-wires. In the treatment after the operation, on the 2nd day, the patient was 
permitted the DIP joint motion by wearing a dynamic splint.At the 12-months 
follow-up, the patient had regained full ROM with no discomfort and the proximal 
phalanx growth plate of the small finger closed naturally with normal 
alignment.When treating a proximal phalangeal base fracture in children, the 
possibility of flexor tendon entrapment should be considered and should be 
carefully dealt with in its treatment.

A 25-year-old man complained of severe pain in the right foot after a traffic 
accident. There was a wound on the medial aspect of the foot extending over the 
length of the first metatarsal. There was no sign of vascular compromise and 
sensations were intact. Radiographs showed dislocation of the first 
tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) and metatarsophalangeal joints with the head of the 
first metatarsal facing proximally and plantarward (reverse floating first 
metatarsal), a segmental fracture of the second metatarsal, fracture dislocation 
of the third metatarsal from the metatarsophalangeal and tarsometatarsal joints 
(floating third metatarsal), and fractures at the base of the fourth and fifth 
metatarsals and of cuneiforms. Open reduction and internal fixation were 
performed. The metatarsal head was buttonholed through the capsule and muscles 
and was released and reduced. The fractured second metatarsal was reduced and 
stabilized with a K-wire. The third floating metatarsal was aligned and fixed 
with a K-wire. A below-knee posterior plaster splint was applied for six weeks. 
Full weight bearing was started at 10 weeks. The patient returned to his 
activities with only minimal discomfort. This is the first reported case of 
plantar Lisfranc dislocation and reverse floating first metatarsal.

Seventy-one patients presenting for day-case arthroscopy were randomly allocated 
to receive either intramuscular diclofenac 75 mg or ketorolac 30 mg immediately 
after induction of anaesthesia. One hour after operation visual analogue pain 
scores were significantly lower in the ketorolac group compared with those 
receiving diclofenac. Pain scores at 2 and 4 h postoperatively were not 
significantly different between the two groups although six of those receiving 
diclofenac required opioid analgesia compared with only one in the ketorolac 
group. Discomfort in the operated knee was similar for both groups on the day 
following surgery, but pain from the intramuscular injection site was 
significantly greater in the diclofenac group. Intramuscular ketorolac 30 mg 
provided better postoperative analgesia and less pain at the injection site than 
diclofenac 75 mg.

We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with a lump in the 
mid-third of the left clavicle, which had recently increased in size to 10 cm in 
diameter. Plain X-ray, computed tomography and bone scans suggested that the 
lump was a parosteal osteosarcoma. Due to the expected 30% functional loss from 
claviculectomy [Wood in The results of total claviculectomy. Clin Orthop Relat 
Res 1986; 207: :186-90.], the patient opted for excision of the tumour plus the 
adjacent clavicle, irradiation and reimplantation of the bone with internal 
fixation. On 2-year follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence or 
complications, with a good range of movement of the joint. On 4-year follow-up, 
the patient was found to have discomfort, and X-rays showed that the clavicle 
had fractured, which was managed symptomatically.

BACKGROUND: Hemophilic knee arthritis is one of the most common presenting 
symptoms of hemophilia, and its management continues to be challenging to 
practitioners. Preliminary research has suggested that platelet-rich plasma 
(PRP) may have short-term efficacy in the treatment of hemophilic knee 
arthritis, but evidence for this treatment is limited.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: What is the effectiveness of PRP compared with placebo in 
(1) reducing pain and improving knee joint function (as measured by WOMAC, VAS, 
and Hemophilia Joint Health Score [HJHS]) and (2) improving quality of life (as 
measured by SF-36 scores) in patients with hemophilic knee arthritis through 24 
months of follow-up?
METHODS: This was a prospective, parallel-group, double-blinded, single-center, 
placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that included participants from a 
tertiary care center starting January 1, 2019, with follow-up completed on 
November 30, 2021. Participants were older than 18 years and had hemophilic knee 
arthritis confirmed by MRI, and they were randomly allocated to interventions in 
a 1:1 ratio. The investigators were not informed of the randomization sequence 
generated by the computer. Patient groups were comparable with respect to age, 
gender, BMI, hemophilia type, and disease severity at baseline. Physicians 
delivered three sessions (one per week) of a standard intraarticular injection 
of PRP (n = 95) or placebo (n = 95). The rate of successful blinding was 
balanced across the groups, which was assessed by asking participants which 
injection they thought they had received. The primary outcome was the WOMAC 
score (range 0 to 96; higher scores indicate more pain and worse function; 
minimum clinically important difference, 6.4 points) over 24 months. Among the 
190 patients assigned to PRP or saline injections (mean age 31 ± 7 years), 100% 
(190) of patients were men). There was no between-group difference in the 
proportion of patients who completed the trial; 97% (92 of 95) of patients in 
the PRP group and 94% (89 of 95) of patients in the placebo group completed the 
trial. The most common adverse events were injection site discomfort 8% (8 of 
95) in the PRP group and 4% (4 of 95) in the placebo group. An 
intention-to-treat analysis was planned, but there was no crossover between 
groups. All patients were included in the analyses. With 95 patients in each 
group, the study was powered a priori at 90% to detect a difference in WOMAC 
score of 6.4 points, which was considered a clinically important difference.
RESULTS: There were no clinically important differences in the mean WOMAC, VAS 
pain, HJHS, SF-36, and MRI scores between groups at any timepoint. 
Intraarticular PRP did not ameliorate function, symptoms, and quality of life in 
patients with hemophilic knee arthritis. At 24 months of follow-up, the mean 
difference between the PRP and placebo groups in the WOMAC score was -1 (95% CI 
-5 to 2; p = 0.42). The mean difference in the VAS pain score was -0.3 (95% CI 
-0.8 to 0.2; p = 0.19), in the HJHS was -0.6 (95% CI -1.4 to 0.1; p = 0.10), in 
the SF-36 physical component summary was 0 (95% CI -2 to 3; p = 0.87), and in 
the SF-36 mental component summary was -1 (95% CI -3 to 2; p = 0.64). The mean 
differences in the MRI scores of soft tissue and osteochondral subscore were 0.1 
(95% CI -0.3 to 0.5; p = 0.59) and -0.3 (95% CI -0.7 to 0.1; p = 0.19), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with hemophilic knee arthritis, three intraarticular 
PRP injections, compared with placebo injections, did not improve hemophilic 
knee symptoms, function, and quality of life over 24 months. The results of this 
study do not support the use of PRP injections in patients who have hemophilic 
knee arthritis.

The use of three types of suture and stainless steel wire tension banding for 
the fixation of simulated olecranon fractures: a comparison study in cadaver 
elbows.

Using an osteotomy of the olecranon as a model of a transverse fracture in 22 
cadaver elbows we determined the ability of three different types of suture and 
stainless steel wire to maintain reduction when using a tension-band technique 
to stabilise the bone. Physiological cyclical loading simulating passive elbow 
movement (15 N) and using the arms to push up from a chair (450 N) were applied 
using an Instron materials testing machine whilst monitoring the osteotomy site 
with a video extensometer. Each osteotomy was repaired by one of four materials, 
namely, Stainless Steel Wire (7), No 2 Ethibond (3), No 5 Ethibond (5), or No 2 
FiberWire (7). There were no failures (movement of > 2 mm) with stainless steel 
wire or FiberWire and no significant difference in the movements measured across 
the site of the osteotomy (p = 0.99). The No. 2 Ethibond failed at 450 N and two 
of the five of No. 5 Ethibond sutures had a separation of > 2 mm at 450 N. 
FiberWire as the tension band in this model held the reduction as effectively as 
stainless steel wire and may reduce the incidence of discomfort from the 
hardware. On the basis of our findings we suggest that a clinical trial should 
be undertaken.

Fourteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) self rated their pain and 
stiffness on separate 10 cm visual analogue scales and performed bead intubation 
coordinometry (BIC) on six occasions each day for seven consecutive days. In 
addition, 14 healthy controls matched for age and sex also performed BIC 
measurements according to the same schedule. Data were analysed using least 
squares and cosine vector techniques. Significant circadian rhythms in patients 
with RA were detected in pain, stiffness, and BIC, and in controls in BIC. Pain 
was least in patients with RA at 1700 and stiffness at 1724. Peak BIC 
performance occurred almost simultaneously in RA (1544) and control (1528) 
subjects and for subjects with RA occurred within the 95% confidence interval of 
least pain and stiffness. These data suggest that the inferior performance of 
subjects with RA may be an accentuation of the normal physiological variation 
seen in healthy controls, but may be modulated by the patient's level of pain or 
stiffness, or both.

BACKGROUND: In our experience results of the Oxford unicompartmental knee 
replacement have not been as good as had been expected. A common post operative 
complaint is of persistent medial knee discomfort, it is not clear why this 
phenomenon occurs and we have attempted to address this in our study.
METHODS: 48 patients were retrospectively identified at a mean of 4.5 years 
(range = 3 to 6 years) following consecutive Oxford medial Unicompartmental Knee 
arthroplasties for varus anteromedial osteoarthritis. The mean age at 
implantation was 67 years (range 57-86). Of these 48 patients, 4 had died, 4 had 
undergone revision of their unicompartmental knee replacements and 2 had been 
lost to follow up leaving 38 patients with 40 replaced knees available for 
analysis using the 'new Oxford Knee Score' questionnaire. During assessment 
patients were asked specifically whether or not they still experienced medial 
knee discomfort or pain.
RESULTS: The mean 'Oxford score' was only 32.7 (range = 16 to 48) and 22 of the 
40 knees were uncomfortable or painful medially.The accuracy of component 
positioning was recorded, using standard post operative xrays, by summing the 
angulation or displacement of each component in two planes from the ideal 
position (according to the 'Oxford knee system radiographic criteria'). No 
correlation was demonstrated between the radiographic scores and the 'Oxford 
scores', or with the presence or absence of medial knee discomfort or pain.
CONCLUSION: In our hands the functional outcome following Oxford 
Unicompartmental knee replacement was variable, with a high incidence of medial 
knee discomfort which did not correlate with the postoperative radiographic 
scores, pre-op arthritis and positioning of the prosthesis.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome causes significant discomfort and disability among 
much of the general population. Despite recent breakthroughs in dynamic 
three-dimensional imaging technologies to assess pathological patellofemoral 
motion, such tools remain costly for clinical diagnostics applications. Thus, 
this study investigated whether three-dimensional patellofemoral kinematics 
could be predicted from routine two-dimensional static measures of 
patellofemoral joint alignment quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
data acquired in full knee extension. Twenty-six volunteers clinically diagnosed 
with patellofemoral pain (19 F/7 M, 25.9 ± 11.1 years) and 26 control subjects 
(19 F/7 M, 25.3 ± 7.7 years) were included in this IRB-approved study. Static 
three-dimensional sagittal T1-weighted gradient recall echo and dynamic MRI 
scans were acquired. For the dynamic image acquisition, subjects cyclically 
flexed and extended their knee (at 30 cycles/min) while a full cine-phase 
contrast MRI set (24 time frames of anatomic images and x-, y-, and z-velocity 
images) was acquired. From these data, static measures of patellofemoral 
alignment and three-dimensional patellofemoral kinematics were derived. Single 
and multiple regressions between static and kinematic variables were evaluated. 
Although shown reliable, the static MRI measures could only partially predict 
patellofemoral kinematics, with r(2) -values ranging from 16% to 77%. This makes 
it imperitave that the current precise, accurate, 3D, dynamic imaging techniques 
be translated into clinical tools.

Research has shown that dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint is often 
associated with tinnitus.
AIM: To characterize tinnitus in individuals with normal hearing and search for 
a possible relationship with Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD).
STUDY DESIGN: prospective and cross-sectional.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants included 20 adults of both genders with 
tinnitus and normal hearing thresholds on audiometry. We studied tinnitus 
psychoacoustic characteristics and employed the checklist of TMD signs and 
symptoms from the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI).
RESULTS: The high pitch, continuous and bilateral tinnitus was the most 
frequent. Upon acuphenometry, the average tinnitus pitch reported by the 
subjects was 8.6 kHz and the average loudness was 14.1 dBSL. The degree of 
discomfort caused by tinnitus was mild. We observed that the higher the pitch, 
the lower was the loudness and the higher was the THI score. We found that 90% 
of the patients had at least one TMD sign or symptom.
CONCLUSIONS: The most common was the high pitch, continuous and bilateral 
tinnitus; 90% of patients had at least one sign or symptom of TMD and there was 
no correlation between the tinnitus and acuphenometry, THI and the TMD 
checklist.

BACKGROUND: Difficulties in kneeling, one of the poorest scoring functional 
outcomes post total knee arthroplasty (TKA),have been attributed to a lack of 
patient education. This is the first study to investigate specific factors 
affecting a patient's perceived ability to kneel post TKA, following exposure to 
a preoperative kneeling education session.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted following TKA with 
patients who had been educated about kneeling prior to the operation. Patients 
completed kneeling questionnaires at 6 (n = 115) and 12 (n = 82) months post 
TKA. In addition to the 12-month kneeling questionnaire, patients also completed 
the Oxford knee score (OKS) survey.
RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients perceived they could kneel at 12 months 
post TKA. Overall, pain and discomfort were the most common factors deterring 
patients from kneeling. Perceived kneeling ability was the poorest scored 
outcome on the OKS with patients reporting mild to moderate difficulty with this 
task. Kneeling scores were strongly correlated with overall knee function scores 
(R = 0.70), strongly correlated with pain scores (R = 0.45) and weakly 
correlated with knee stability scores (R = 0.29). When asked about other factors 
preventing kneeling other than pain or discomfort, 75 % had reasons unrelated to 
the knee or TKA. The most common reason was 'problems with the other knee' 
(n = 19).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this study were provided with education regarding their 
kneeling ability post TKA, yet still experienced limitations in perceived 
kneeling ability postoperatively. Contrary to previous research, our study 
suggests that factors other than patient education affect a patient's perceived 
kneeling ability post TKA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and to compare the Spaso and Kocher reduction maneuvers 
in terms of efficiency, time of reduction, facileness, pain, discomfort to the 
patient, complications and risks, besides promoting the comparison between the 
two maneuvers, aiming to ground the emergency conduct.
METHODS: A prospective study with 105 patients with acute shoulder dislocations 
were enrolled in the study between February 2011 and September 2012. The 
patients were randomized into two groups and they were submitted to the 
reduction of dislocation using the Spaso maneuver (group A) or the Kocher 
technique (group B) by first, second or third-year orthopedic surgery residents 
from our service. The results were evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two 
groups in terms of age, gender, timing of reduction, number of precedent 
episodes and complications after reduction. However, reduction was achieved in 
more cases using the Spaso method than it was among the Kocher group, as well as 
the mean duration of the reduction maneuver and discomfort were shorter in the 
group A patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Both methods presented good results in terms of dislocation 
reduction and low complications rates. Nevertheless, the Spaso maneuver was more 
efficient, fast and easily applicable in comparison with Kocher's method. Level

Assessment of the Lequesne index of severity for osteoarthritis of the hip in an 
elderly population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the measurement properties of the Lequesne index of 
severity for osteoarthritis of the hip (LISOH) together with its overall 
usefulness with reference to the original stated aims.
METHOD: Postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 5500 Oxfordshire 
residents, aged 65 and above. Respondents with hip symptoms at baseline (but 
without verification of a diagnosis) were sent an identical follow-up 
questionnaire 12 months later. The questionnaire included a general health 
section, including the Short Form-36 survey, and a hip section which began with 
a screening question about hip pain. Respondents who reported having a prolonged 
episode of hip pain were asked to complete the LISOH.
RESULTS: At baseline, response rate of 66.3% (3341/5039) was obtained from 
eligible participants; 19.2% (610/3175) of respondents reported having hip pain. 
Internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.86) for all 11 
items of the LISOH; however, factor analysis identified two factors 
(sub-scales): "function and mobility" and "pain and discomfort". Rasch analysis 
revealed that the two factors were only unidimensional when applied to 
sub-groups of respondents. Convergent validity of the LISOH was questionable, as 
the "function and mobility" factor was more highly correlated with SF-36 bodily 
pain score than was the "pain and discomfort" factor. The assessment of 
sensitivity over time was problematic due to changing patterns of symptomatic 
weight-bearing joints over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study identifies major limitations with the 
LISOH--particularly if used as a single composite measure.

Croom, Limerick, Ireland.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of the popliteal angle as an indicator for 
successful closed reduction of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in 
children with delayed presentation.
METHODS: 29 patients aged 6 to 18 months underwent successful closed reduction 
for unilateral DDH under general anaesthesia. Using a graduated goniometer, the 
popliteal angle was measured with the hip abducted within the safe zone (to 
avoid redislocation and injury to the femoral capital epiphysis) before and 
after reduction and after 6 weeks of spica casting.
RESULTS: The mean popliteal angles before and after reduction and after 6 weeks 
of spica casting were 5.1, 37.5, and 17.9 degrees, respectively (p<0.0001, 
paired t test). Because of discomfort, the spica casts were altered in 3 
patients (2 at week 1 and one at week 3).
CONCLUSION: Reduction of the hip in DDH results in an increased popliteal angle 
of >20 degree. This may be used to indicate the diagnosis and safe closed 
reduction.

Fatal yellow fever in a traveler returning from Venezuela, 1999.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

On September 28, 1999, a previously healthy 48-year-old man from California 
sought care at a local emergency department (ED) and was hospitalized with a 
2-day history of fever (102 F [38.9 C]), chills, headache, photophobia, diffuse 
myalgias, joint pains, nausea, vomiting, constipation, upper abdominal 
discomfort, and general weakness. On September 26, he had returned from a 10-day 
trip to Venezuela. On September 29, an infectious disease physician from the ED 
contacted the Marin County Health Department (MCHD) about the patient's 
symptoms; MCHD reported his illness to the California Department of Health 
Services (CDHS) as a suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever. This report 
describes the investigation of the case.

OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the long-term effect of occupational 
determinants on knee pain. We aimed to assess whether the risk factors for 
severe knee pain, observed with a cross-sectional approach, were still relevant 
after retirement, 12 years later.
METHODS: All men participating in the ARPEGE side study of the GAZEL cohort 
(employees of the French national utility for energy production and 
distribution, recruited in 1989) and who answered the 1994 or 1995 general GAZEL 
self-administered questionnaire, were included. Weight and self-reported 
exposures over the entire working life were collected at baseline. Knee pain and 
its intensity were recorded in 1994-1995 and again in 2006. Moderate and severe 
knee pain, defined from an intensity or discomfort scale (threshold 3 on a 
6-level scale in 1994-1995, and 4 on an 8-level scale in 2006), were the main 
outcomes.
RESULTS: At baseline, 1786 men were included. In 1994-1995, moderate knee pain 
was observed among 10.3% and severe pain in 12.8% of men. In 2006, 1482 men 
(83%) answered the questionnaire. Moderate and severe knee pain were observed in 
18.6% and 16.3% of respondents, respectively. Working in a kneeling or squatting 
position was significantly associated with severe knee pain at baseline, taking 
into account age, sports, smoking habits, and body mass index [adjusted odds 
ratio (OR (adj)) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1-1.9 for "ever 
exposed" and OR (adj)2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.1 for >25 years of exposure]. In 2006, 
when most subjects were retired, the association between working in a kneeling 
or squatting position and severe pain was weaker but still significant (OR 
(adj)1.4, 95% CI 1.04-1.85).
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of high knee exposure in the working life on severe knee 
pain remains even after retirement, although decreased. An extended surveillance 
and prevention program for these workers could be proposed.

Lateral displacement of the mandible in Rhesus monkeys.

Blankenship JR, Ramfjord SP.

Lateral displacement of the mandible was induced experimentally in five adult 
male Rhesus monkeys. Following from 2 1/2 weeks to 19 months, the animals were 
sacrificed and examined histologically. Two of the monkeys received H3 proline 4 
months prior to sacrifice and radioautographs were prepared. The lateral 
displacement apparently caused great discomfort because the monkeys refused to 
eat and lost weight rapidly for a few months. After about 12 months, the monkeys 
could again eat their normal diet to the extent they started to gain weight 
slowly. The histological and radio-autographic findings indicated almost no 
changes of the articular surfaces of the temporomandibular joints. However, 
extensive reorganization of the neck of the condyles was observed. Severe 
periodontal trauma and extensive movements of the teeth occurred in spite of the 
fact that the teeth in each jaw were splinted firmly together.

A six-year-old girl was examined upon development of pain, swelling, and locking 
in her right knee after a considerable period of discomfort and popping 
sensation. She had no history of trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 
discoid lateral meniscus, filling the entire lateral plateau and exhibiting 
signs of degeneration. On arthroscopic examination, a bucket-handle tear of the 
discoid lateral meniscus was noted and the patient was treated with arthroscopic 
subtotal meniscectomy. During the first month of follow-up, the patient had a 
full range of motion and normal gait. At three years, she maintained full range 
of motion without pain, locking, or popping. Due to the likelihood of joint 
degeneration, long-term follow-up was recommended.

Total hip replacement in osteoarthrosis using the Charnley prosthesis.

Todd RC, Lightowler CD, Harris J.

Charnley low-friction arthroplasty was performed on 352 osteoarthritic hips, 
usually because of severe pain. Three hundred and twenty hips were reviewed at a 
special follow-up clinic or by postal questionnaire. After operation 89% of hips 
were pain-free or caused only occasional discomfort, and in 76% there was an 
increased range of movement. Of those patients actually seen for review 79% were 
judged to have a good or excellent result. The most frequent single complication 
was deep infection, which occurred in 5.3% of hips.

The effect of a subject-specific amount of lateral wedge on knee mechanics in 
patients with medial knee osteoarthritis.

Avenue, Evansville, Indiana 47722, USA. rb83@evansville.edu

We examined if a subject-specific amount of lateral wedge added to a foot 
orthosis could alter knee mechanics to potentially reduce the progression of 
knee osteoarthritis in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis. Twenty 
individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis (>/=2 Kellgren Lawrence grade) were 
prescribed a custom laterally wedged foot orthotic device. The prescribed wedge 
amount was the minimal wedge amount that provided the maximum amount of pain 
reduction during a lateral step-down test. Following an accommodation period, 
all subjects returned to the laboratory for a gait analysis. Knee mechanics were 
collected as the subjects walked at an intentional walking speed. Walking in the 
laterally wedged orthotic device significantly reduced the peak adduction moment 
during early stance (p < 0.01) compared to the nonwedged device. Similarly, the 
wedged orthotic device significantly reduced the knee adduction excursion from 
heel strike to peak adduction (p < 0.01) compared to the nonwedged device. No 
differences in the peak adduction moment during propulsion or peak adduction 
during stance were observed between the orthotic conditions. A subject-specific 
laterally wedged orthotic device was able to reduce the peak knee adduction 
moment during early stance, which is thought to be associated with the 
progression of knee osteoarthritis. Previous studies on this device have 
reported issues associated with foot discomfort when using wedge amounts >7 
degrees; however, no such issues were reported in this study. Therefore, 
providing a custom laterally wedged orthotic device may potentially increase 
compliance while still potentially reducing disease progression.

Surgical correction of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome: a case report of esotropia, 
entropion, and blepharoptosis.

We report a case of surgical treatment for Hallermann-Streiff syndrome in a 
patient with ocular manifestations of esotropia, entropion, and blepharoptosis. 
A 54-year-old man visited Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital complaining of ocular 
discomfort due to cilia touching the corneas of both eyes for several years. He 
had a bird-like face, pinched nose, hypotrichosis of the scalp, mandibular 
hypoplasia with forward displacement of the temporomandibular joints, a small 
mouth, and proportional short stature. His ophthalmic features included sparse 
eyelashes and eyebrows, microphthalmia, nystagmus, lower lid entropion in the 
right eye, and upper lid entropion with blepharoptosis in both eyes. There was 
esodeviation of the eyeball of more than 100 prism diopters at near and 
distance, and there were limitations in ocular movement on lateral gaze. The 
capsulopalpebral fascia was repaired to treat the right lower lid entropion, but 
an additional Quickert suture was required to prevent recurrence. Blepharoplasty 
and levator palpebrae repair were performed for blepharoptosis and 
dermatochalasis. Three months after lid surgery, the right medial rectus muscle 
was recessed 7.5 mm, the left medial rectus was recessed 7.25 mm, and the left 
lateral rectus muscle was resected 8.0 mm.

INTRODUCTION: Large ganglionic cystic formations arising from the infrapatellar 
fat pad are quite uncommon and only a few are mentioned in the literature. An 
open excision in these cases is mandatory.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a large infrapatellar fat pad ganglion 
in a 37-year-old Greek man with chronic knee discomfort. The ganglionic cyst 
originated from the infrapatellar fat pad and had no intrasynovial extension. 
The final diagnosis was determined with magnetic resonance imaging of the knee, 
and the lesion was treated with surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: These lesions are asymptomatic in most cases but often are 
misdiagnosed as meniscal or ligamentous lesions of the knee joint. Nowadays, the 
therapeutic trend for such lesions is arthroscopic excision, but when there is a 
large ganglion, as in this case report, the treatment should be an open and 
thorough resection. This report is intended mostly but not exclusively for 
clinical physicians and radiologists.

Dental wear caused by association between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux 
disease: a rehabilitation report.

Bruxism is a pathological activity of the stomatognathic system that involves 
tooth grinding and clenching during parafunctional jaw movements. Clinical signs 
of bruxism are mostly related to dental wear and muscular and joint discomforts, 
but a large number of etiological factors can be listed, as local, systemic, 
psychological and hereditary factors. The association between bruxism, feeding 
and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to 
dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and 
cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and 
muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This 
paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, 
smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great 
muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes. From the diagnosis, a 
multidisciplinary treatment plan was established. The initial treatment approach 
consisted of medical follow up with counseling on diet and smoking habits and 
management of the gastric disorders. This was followed by the installation of an 
interocclusal acrylic device in centric relation of occlusion (CRO) for 
reestablishment of the occlusal stability, vertical dimension of occlusion, 
anterior guides and return to normal muscle activity (90-day use approximately). 
After remission of initial symptoms, oral rehabilitation was implemented in CRO 
by means of full resin composite restorations and new interocclusal device for 
protection of restorations. Satisfactory esthetics, improved function and 
occlusal stability were obtained after oral rehabilitation. The patient has 
attended annual follow-ups for the past 2 years. The multidisciplinary treatment 
seems to be the key for a successful rehabilitation of severe cases of dental 
wear involving the association of different health disorders.

We present a case of a 58-yr-old male to illustrate the scintigraphic, 
roentgenographic, clinical, and pathologic features of periarticular tumoral 
calcinosis that occurred in a hemodialysis patient. Soft-tissue calcifications 
developed 3 yr after onset of hemodialysis, became progressively larger during 
the ensuing five years, and culminated in voluntary withdrawal from dialysis 
because of the extreme discomfort and lack of mobility that resulted from the 
calcinosis. Histologically, an aplastic disorder was present with very low bone 
formation. On bone scintigraphy, intense calcium uptake in soft tissues implied 
that it was metabolically active. We hypothesize that this high metabolic 
activity contributed to the persistent hypercalcemia observed during the 
patient's last year of life.

of Campinas, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present pilot study was to describe pain 
complaints of TMD patients and cervical spine dysfunction.
METHODS: Fourteen women with myogenous TMD, cervical motion limitation and 
rotation of at least one of the three first cervical vertebrae evidenced by 
radiographic examination participated in this study. The multidimensional pain 
evaluation was accomplished by a Brazilian version of the McGill Pain 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The results showed that the most painful body site mentioned was 
cervical spine, followed by scapular region and temporomandibular joint. More 
than half of the volunteers reported temporal pain pattern as rhythmic, periodic 
and, or still, intermittent. The majority of the patients classified the pain 
intensity assessed at the moment of the evaluation as mild to discomforting. 
Absolute agreement was not observed among volunteers regarding word dimensions 
used to describe their pain, although a great number of patients chose the 
descriptor related to tension as the better expression to describe their painful 
complaint.
CONCLUSION: Pain characteristics of TMD patients with cervical spine dysfunction 
showed cervical spine as a common painful region reported and words related to 
affective and emotional dimensions of pain perception can be used by these 
patients to qualify their pain complain.

OBJETIVO: objetivo deste trabalho foi descrever as queixas de dor em portadores 
de Disfunção Temporomandibular (DTM) com disfunção da coluna cervical.
MÉTODOS: Participaram desta pesquisa 14 portadores de DTM miogênica, do sexo 
feminino, com limitação do movimento cervical e rotação de pelo menos uma das 
três primeiras vértebras cervicais, diagnosticada através de exame radiográfico. 
A avaliação multidimensional da dor foi realizada usando uma versão brasileira 
do questionário McGill de dor (Br-MPQ).
RESULTADOS: Foi observado que a região mais indicada como dolorosa foi a região 
cervical, seguida pela região da cintura escapular e articulação 
temporomandibular. Com relação ao padrão temporal da dor, mais da metade dos 
voluntários anotaram que suas queixas tinham uma característica ritmada, 
periódica ou intermitente. A intensidade da dor presente registrada no momento 
da avaliação foi classificada como de leve a forte para a maior parte dos 
participantes da pesquisa. Nenhuma das dimensões de palavras que descrevem a dor 
obteve concordância absoluta entre os voluntários, porém a maioria dos 
voluntários escolheu o descritor relacionado à tensão como a expressão que 
melhor descreve sua queixa dolorosa.
CONCLUSÃO: A característica da queixa de dor, dos portadores de DTM e disfunção 
da coluna cervical, mostrou que a região cervical é a área mais freqüentemente 
indicada e que palavras relacionadas as dimensões afetiva e emocional, da 
percepção de dor, podem ser usadas por estes pacientes para qualificar sua 
queixa de dor.

The placement of cases of Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis (EPTB) on the appropriate 
Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) regimen remains a problematic 
issue in India and often, consultants delay this, leading to significant 
avoidable pain, discomfort and reduction in the quality of life of the patients. 
In contrast, a prompt institution of the DOTS regimen can regress such problems, 
even at a delayed stage. The following case report on polyarticular tuberculosis 
which involved the bilateral knee and ankle joints without a pulmonary or 
disseminated form of tuberculosis, amply highlights these facts.

Patients suffering from adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are very ill 
and present most commonly with shortness of breath during physical activity, a 
pale complexion from anemia, a very low platelet count, the appearance of 
pinhead-sized red spots under the skin called petechiae, or prolonged bleeding 
from minor cuts and discomfort in the bones and joints. Fever in the absence of 
an obvious cause is common. Leukemic lymphoblasts may accumulate in the 
lymphatic system, and lymph nodes can be enlarged. We report a young adult male 
with a novel translocation in ALL, who had vague (uncertain) minimal symptoms 
and splenomegaly. The patient had a unique cytogenetic abnormality: 
45,XY,der(9)t(9;12)(p24;q12),-12, which has not been previously described in 
ALL. This is categorized as a poor risk due to his failure to achieve complete 
remission after induction chemotherapy.

The issue of whether a traumatic but occult cervical spine fracture can exist 
has generated significant debate in emergency medicine. The profound clinical 
and legal implications of missing an unstable cervical spine injury are well 
known to the emergency care provider. An elderly patient who satisfies all of 
the rigorous criteria for this type of injury is discussed. The patient 
experienced delayed subluxation of her acute odontoid fracture during a 
flexion/extension examination completed in the ED, with resultant development of 
cervical discomfort. Elderly victims of trauma with an appropriate mechanism of 
injury should be suspected of subtle or occult neck injuries.

Synovial chondromatosis (SC) in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is an uncommon 
entity, mostly when the involvement is bilateral. The authors report a rare case 
of bilateral SC, with a follow-up of 13 months, and a literature review. A 
60-year-old Caucasian woman, with the chief complaint of pain for 6 years in the 
bilateral pre-auricular region, had a progressive clacking and discomfort on the 
left side during mouth opening. The panoramic image was suggestive of SC. The 
bilateral lesion was surgically removed by direct access. Histopathological 
examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis of bilateral SC. This article shows 
the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for the early diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment. Also, it encourages the referral of such cases to 
professionals with a greater familiarity with this entity.

Instability of the proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) can present as frank 
dislocations, vague symptoms of lateral knee pain, discomfort during activity, 
or symptoms related to irritation of the common peroneal nerve. An accurate 
preoperative diagnosis is imperative and should include a trial of taping of the 
PTFJ for a 4- to 6-week time frame before surgical reconstruction is indicated. 
In the adolescent population, surgical planning can be complicated by the 
presence of open physes; therefore, caution must be taken to avoid drilling 
through or placing screw fixation across the physes. Potential complications 
include growth arrest and limb length discrepancy. Therefore, the purpose of 
this Technical Note is to describe the surgical technique for addressing PTFJ 
instability in adolescent patients.

[Purpose] The Purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of spiral 
taping on proprioception in functional ankle instability. [Subjects and Methods] 
Thirty-five participants in this study had discomfort in only one ankle and 
Cumberland ankle instability score of ≤23. ST was applied to the unstable ankle, 
and proprioception was measured baseline and 30 min later. Proprioception was 
measured using the active joint angle reproduction test. [Results] Plantar 
flexions of 10° (ES, 0.303) and 20° (ES, 1.369) and inversion 20° (ES, 0.998) 
showed a significant improvement. [Conclusion] Spiral taping improved on 
proprioception. Therefore, spiral taping may be an effective method for 
functional ankle instability.

Although the rate of patients reporting satisfaction is generally high after 
joint replacement surgery, up to 23% after total hip replacement and 34% after 
total knee arthroplasty of treated subjects report discomfort or pain 1 year 
after surgery. Moreover, chronic or subacute inflammation is reported in some 
cases even a long time after surgery. Another open and debated issue in 
prosthetic surgery is implant survivorship, especially when related to good 
prosthesis bone ingrowth. Pulsed Electro Magnetic Fields (PEMFs) treatment, 
although initially recommended after total joint replacement to promote bone 
ingrowth and to reduce inflammation and pain, is not currently part of usual 
clinical practice. The purpose of this review was to analyze existing literature 
on PEMFs effects in joint replacement surgery and to report results of clinical 
studies and current indications. We selected all currently available prospective 
studies or RCT on the use of PEMFs in total joint replacement with the purpose 
of investigating effects of PEMFs on recovery, pain relief and patients' 
satisfaction following hip, knee or shoulder arthroplasty. All the studies 
analyzed reported no adverse effects, and good patient compliance to the 
treatment. The available literature shows that early control of joint 
inflammation process in the first days after surgery through the use of PEMFs 
should be considered an effective completion of the surgical procedure to 
improve the patient's functional recovery.

When open-book injuries are neglected and result into a pelvic malunion or 
nonunion, long-term problems, such as chronic pain, gait abnormalities, sitting 
discomfort, neurological symptoms and urogenital symptoms can occur. In this 
case report, we describe the repair of a neglected pelvic disruption with the 
dislocation of the urinary bladder in a one-stage procedure. The clinical image 
with which the patient presented could be split into unique sub-problems, for 
which separate solutions needed to be chosen: large symphysis diastasis, 
instability and pain in both SI joints, malunion of the superior and inferior 
pubic rami fractures; and urinary bladder herniation into the upper thigh. In a 
single-stage procedure, the pelvic ring was reconstructed and the bladder 
reduced. The patient was thereafter continent for urine and could walk 
independently. A complex clinical problem was divided into its sub-problems, for 
which specific solutions were found.

In this study, we discuss a case of a 59-year-old male who developed a 
periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) three months after a total hip arthroplasty 
(THA). The patient complained of groin and buttock pain, swelling, and high 
temperature. A palpable fluid collection, discomfort, edema, and elevated local 
temperature were present in the clinical examination. Laboratory analysis 
revealed elevated white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and 
C-reactive protein (CRP). The preoperative joint aspiration came up positive for 
Staphylococcus caprae (S. caprae) infection. Diagnosis and pathogen 
identification were confirmed by histological examination of six tissue samples 
obtained during surgery. We initially performed early debridement, antibiotics, 
and implant retention (DAIR) followed by antibiotic therapy suggested by an 
infectious disease specialist. DAIR failed two months later, and we proceeded to 
a two-stage revision. Following surgery, the patient was treated with 
intravenous antibiotic combination therapy for three weeks and thereafter with 
oral antibiotics for three months. Four months down the line, the patient is 
free of symptoms, and the inflammatory markers are normal. Finally, we will 
proceed with the second stage of revision. This study highlights a very rare 
case of PJI infection by S. caprae, reviews the limited literature, and provides 
the available evidence for surgical and antibiotic management.

Awareness of Heterotopic Ossification in Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Primer.

Lespasio MJ(1), Guarino AJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Boston Medical Center, MA.

Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the presence of normal bone in soft tissue 
where bone should not exist. After direct musculoskeletal trauma of the 
surrounding soft tissue, HO is hypothesized to develop from a dysfunction of 
normal lamellar bone formation and remodeling that appears in nonskeletal areas 
of the body. Acquired HO related to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) of the hip 
and knee forms outside the joint capsule and can be a challenging condition when 
it impairs the essential healing process after elective surgery. Although HO is 
rare after elective TJA and thus clinically immaterial, when clinically relevant 
HO develops, patients may experience the following: 1) limited ambulation, 2) 
restricted range of motion, and 3) severe pain and discomfort that may lead to 
loss of function. Ultimately, patients with clinically relevant HO after 
elective TJA may require additional treatment, including medication, radiation 
therapy, manipulation under anesthesia, surgical excision of the HO, and 
possibly revision TJA. Awareness of HO and an understanding of the associated 
risk factors along with the various management options will enable health care 
practitioners and their patients to optimize their surgical outcomes.

Cross-Modality Image Synthesis via Weakly Coupled and Geometry Co-Regularized 
Joint Dictionary Learning.

Yawen Huang, Ling Shao, Frangi AF.

Multi-modality medical imaging is increasingly used for comprehensive assessment 
of complex diseases in either diagnostic examinations or as part of medical 
research trials. Different imaging modalities provide complementary information 
about living tissues. However, multi-modal examinations are not always possible 
due to adversary factors, such as patient discomfort, increased cost, prolonged 
scanning time, and scanner unavailability. In additionally, in large imaging 
studies, incomplete records are not uncommon owing to image artifacts, data 
corruption or data loss, which compromise the potential of multi-modal 
acquisitions. In this paper, we propose a weakly coupled and geometry 
co-regularized joint dictionary learning method to address the problem of 
cross-modality synthesis while considering the fact that collecting the large 
amounts of training data is often impractical. Our learning stage requires only 
a few registered multi-modality image pairs as training data. To employ both 
paired images and a large set of unpaired data, a cross-modality image matching 
criterion is proposed. Then, we propose a unified model by integrating such a 
criterion into the joint dictionary learning and the observed common feature 
space for associating cross-modality data for the purpose of synthesis. 
Furthermore, two regularization terms are added to construct robust sparse 
representations. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance of 
the proposed model over state-of-the-art methods.

OBJECTIVE: Safety concerns or contraindications in the use of hormones have 
resulted in a rise in the use of nutritional medicinal products for the 
management of menopausal symptoms. The aim of the present study was to 
demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Exelvit Menopause®.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, open, observational, and multicentre study 
was performed, including 156 menopausal women. The patients received the 
nutritional product containing evening primrose oil 50 mg; hop extract 
0.127-0.212 mg; saffron Stigmas Extract 0.6 mg; tryptophan 71.25 mg, vitamins 
B6, D3, K2, B12, and B9 once per day for 12 weeks. The validated menopausal 
rating score (MRS) was used for recording symptoms.
RESULTS: A decrease in the MRS of all menopausal symptoms was observed after 12 
weeks compared to baseline (p < 0. 0001). Overall, hot flashes were reduced by 
48.15%, heart discomfort by 33.3%, sleep disturbance by 46.2%, joint and 
muscular discomfort by 27.8%, depressive mood by 45.0%, irritability by 47.6%, 
anxiety by 44.4%, physical problems by 36.4%, sexual problems by 30.0%, bladder 
problems 31.3%, and vaginal dryness by 33.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional product Exelvit Menopause® significantly reduced 
menopausal symptoms.

Ear complaints induced by interior pressure transients are common experiences 
for passengers and crew members when high-speed trains are passing through 
tunnels. However, approaches to assessing the risks of the pressure-related 
aural discomfort have not been reported until recently. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the hazards of interior pressure transients of high-speed 
train on human ears combining the effects of operation speed and seal index. 
Moving model tests were conducted to obtain the pressure transients when the 
model train runs in the tunnel. The recorded data were transformed into the 
interior pressures by empirical formula. Furthermore, the aural sensations were 
divided into four levels hierarchically and the range for each level was derived 
by logistic regression analysis method and represented by three biomechanical 
metrics. Furthermore, a human middle ear finite element (FE) model was used to 
simulate its dynamics under the interior pressures. The results indicate that 
lifting operation speed from 250 km/h to 350 km/h in tunnel will prolong the 
duration of ear complaints by more than two times whereas improving the seal 
index from 4 s to 12 s will reduce the incidences of the onset of tinnitus and 
hearing loss by more than ten times. In addition, the duration of aural comfort 
shortens from the head car to the tail car against the running direction. It is 
desirable that enhancing the seal index improve the aural sensations of the 
passengers and crew members considering the lifting operation speed of 
high-speed train.

RATIONALE: Osteochondroma is a common benign bone tumor consisting of 
cartilage-covered bone confluent with the medullary canal of the epiphysis. 
Extraosseous osteochondroma shares the same appearance and histologic features 
as a typical osteochondroma but does not have any attachment to surrounding bone 
structures. Because of its low incidence, extraosseous osteochondroma is 
uncommon in clinical workups and thus prone to misdiagnosis. The diagnosis of 
extraosseous osteochondroma should be considered when there is a well-defined 
bony mass in the soft tissue with no direct continuity with the adjacent bone or 
joint. Here, we present a case of an imaging diagnosis of "calcified bursitis in 
the subcutaneous superficial fascial layer" and a postoperative pathological 
diagnosis of "extraosseous osteochondroma."
PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 61-year-old man who had a right plantar heel 
mass for 2 years and recently visited the hospital because of discomfort in 
shoes.
DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with pathological examination.
INTERVENTIONS: After completing the relevant preoperative examination and 
preoperative preparation and excluding contraindications to surgery, surgery was 
performed under nerve block anesthesia.
OUTCOMES: We performed surgical resection, and the patient did not have obvious 
discomfort when discharged from the hospital. Auxiliary examination showed no 
abnormalities.
LESSONS: For foot tumors, we need to consider the possibility of extraosseous 
osteochondroma. After completing the auxiliary examination, we should determine 
the relationship between the tumor and its surrounding tissues and blood supply 
before surgery to avoid causing major trauma.

The indications and clinical necessity for routine hardware removal after 
treating ankle or distal tibia fracture with open reduction and internal 
fixation are disputed even when hardware-related pain is insignificant. Thus, we 
determined the clinical effects of routine hardware removal irrespective of the 
degree of hardware-related pain, especially in the perspective of patients' 
daily activities. This study was conducted on 80 consecutive cases (78 patients) 
treated by surgery and hardware removal after bony union. There were 56 ankle 
and 24 distal tibia fractures. The hardware-related pain, ankle joint stiffness, 
discomfort on ambulation, and patient satisfaction were evaluated before and at 
least 6 months after hardware removal. Pain score before hardware removal was 
3.4 (range 0 to 6) and decreased to 1.3 (range 0 to 6) after removal. 58 (72.5%) 
patients experienced improved ankle stiffness and 65 (81.3%) less discomfort 
while walking on uneven ground and 63 (80.8%) patients were satisfied with 
hardware removal. These results suggest that routine hardware removal after 
ankle or distal tibia fracture could ameliorate hardware-related pain and 
improves daily activities and patient satisfaction even when the 
hardware-related pain is minimal.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and degenerative disease, which may result 
in significant pain and decreased quality of life. Recent updates in our 
understanding of OA have demonstrated that it is a whole joint disease that has 
many similarities to an unhealed wound containing inflammatory cytokines. The 
nSTRIDE Autologous Protein Solution (APS) Kit is a medical device under 
development for the treatment of OA. The APS Kit processes a patient's own blood 
at the point of care to contain high concentrations of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines and anabolic growth factors. This study assessed the safety and 
treatment effects of a single intra-articular injection of APS. Eleven patients 
were enrolled in this study. Sufficient blood could not be drawn from one 
patient who was subsequently withdrawn, leaving 10 patients treated. Minor 
adverse events (AEs) were experienced by seven subjects (63.6%). There was one 
serious AE (diverticulitis) unrelated to the device or procedure. One subject 
experienced AEs that were judged "likely" to be procedure related 
(arthralgia/musculoskeletal discomfort) and all resolved within 6 days of 
injection. All other AEs were unrelated to the device or procedure. Western 
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores 
improved significantly over time (ANOVA, p < 0.0001, 12.0 ± 1.2 preinjection, 
3.3 ± 2.9 one year postinjection, and 72.5% WOMAC pain improvement). There was 
significant positive correlation between white blood cell concentration in APS 
and improvement in WOMAC pain scores.

AIM: The aim of this paper is to examine the continuity of care and general 
wellbeing of patients with comorbidities undergoing elective total hip or knee 
joint replacement.
BACKGROUND: Advances in medical science and improved lifestyles have reduced 
mortality rates in most Western countries. As a result, there is an ageing 
population with a concomitant growth in the number of people who are living with 
multiple chronic illnesses, commonly referred to as comorbidities. These 
patients often require acute care services, creating a blend of acute and 
chronic illness needs. For example, joint replacement surgery is frequently 
performed to improve impaired mobility associated with osteoarthritis.
METHOD: A purposive sample of twenty participants with multiple comorbidities 
who required joint replacement surgery was recruited to obtain survey, interview 
and medical record audit data. Data were collected during 2004 and 2005.
FINDINGS: Comorbidity care was poorly co-ordinated prior to having surgery, 
during the acute care stay and following surgery and primarily entailed 
prescribed medicines. The main focus in acute care was patient throughput 
following joint replacement surgery according to a prescribed clinical pathway. 
General wellbeing was less than optimal: participants reported pain, fatigue, 
insomnia and alterations in urinary elimination as the chief sources of 
discomfort during the course of the study.
CONCLUSION: Continuity of care of comorbidities was lacking. Comorbidities 
affected patient general wellbeing and delayed recovery from surgery. Acute 
care, clinical pathways and the specialisation of medicine and nursing 
subordinated the general problem of patients with comorbidities. Systems 
designed to integrate and co-ordinate chronic illness care had limited 
application in the acute care setting. A multidisciplinary, holistic approach is 
required. Recommendations for further research conclude this paper.

OBJECTIVES: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are characterized by pain or 
discomfort in the temporomandibular joint, periauricular region, masticatory 
muscles, and neck on one or both sides. It may also be associated with joint 
sounds, restricted mandibular movements and mandibular deviation. Oxidative 
agents may have a deleterious role in the pathogenesis of joint diseases, and 
oxidative stress can lead to TMD. The aim of this study was to assess the 
oxidative stress biomarkers in the saliva of TMD patients and healthy controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 30 patients with 
TMDs (5 males and 25 females) with a mean age of 30.7±13.2 years, and 30 healthy 
controls (5 males and 25 females) with a mean age of 29.16±11.2 years. Saliva 
samples were collected according to the standard protocol and the total 
antioxidant capacity of the saliva (non-enzymatic), catalase activity, and 
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using the ferric reducing ability of 
plasma, Aebi's method, and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. 
Finally, The MDA levels were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. Other 
quantitative parameters were analyzed by independent t-test.
RESULTS: TMD patients had significantly higher salivary levels of MDA compared 
to the control group (P=0.001). But there were no significant differences in 
catalase (P=0.49) and total antioxidant capacity (P=0.22) of TMD patients and 
healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: It seems that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis 
of TMDs.

Natural rubber is considered an economic plant in Thailand and is used to 
manufacture many products. Foam back pillows have proven to have various 
benefits for the lower back. However, no study has compared the effects of foam 
and rubber pillows. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare the efficacy 
of foam and rubber pillows on transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscle 
fatigue, patient satisfaction, and discomfort scores during 60 min of prolonged 
sitting. Thirty healthy participants were invited to the study and randomized 
into three sitting conditions over three consecutive days. The three groups were 
as follows: control, foam pillow, and rubber pillow. Our results revealed that 
the discomfort score increased with the sitting time in all three groups (p < 
0.05). The control group had the highest discomfort when compared to the rubber 
pillow group at 30 min (T4; p = 0.007) and 60 min (T7; p = 0.0001), as well as 
the foam pillow group at 60 min (T7; p = 0.0001). Participants were more 
satisfied sitting with the two types of back pillows at the initial time (T1; p 
= 0.0001) and at 60 min (T7; p = 0.0001) when compared with the control group. 
Furthermore, the participants were more satisfied with using rubber pillows 
rather than foam pillows throughout the sitting period (p = 0.0001). The control 
group experienced more transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscle fatigue 
at 60 min (T7) of sitting compared to the initial time (T1) (p = 0.038). Thus, 
sitting with pillow support can decrease deep trunk muscle fatigue, and using a 
pillow made from natural rubber may ensure greater satisfaction and less 
discomfort for the user.

INTRODUCTION: Intra-articular distal radius fractures have long been massively 
discussed in the literature, but regarding to fractures that possess rotated 
volar medial fragment in the joint a few amount papers has been written. In this 
article, we would like to emphasize the significance of the rotated palmar 
medial (lunate facet) fragment.
CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old man fell from a height of about 3 m and landed on his 
right outstretched hand; within 40 min, he arrived at our clinic presenting with 
a severe pain and swelling in his right wrist. Initial X-rays of the wrist 
revealed dorsal subluxation of the radiocarpal joint with dorsal comminution of 
the radial articular surface and fracture of the radial styloid process, with 
(nearly inverted) ~ 140-150° rotation of the palmar medial fragment. With an 
additional volar approach, the fragment reduced and stabilized with two K-wires 
and wrist immobilized in external fixator. The patient returned to daily 
activities without any discomfort and pain after the 1 year from the surgery.
CONCLUSION: Overlooking of palmar rotated osteochondral fragment will cause 
deficiency to build proper pre-operative strategy to approach the reduction of 
the fragment. The incompetence of reduction will deteriorate the articular 
surface and lead to early osteoarthritis of the wrist. The surgeon should detect 
this fragment and should be familiar with volar approaches of the wrist. Above 
average surgical experience would be needed for successful reduction.

Sternoclavicular dislocations account for less than 5% of all dislocations of 
the scapular belt. Most cases of anterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular 
joint do not present symptoms. However, some patients may develop chronic 
anterior instability and remain symptomatic, and surgical treatment is indicated 
in these cases. There is a scarcity of reports in the literature relating to 
reconstruction using the long palmar tendon in cases of traumatic anterior 
instability. Although rare, these injuries deserve rapid diagnosis and efficient 
treatment in order to avoid future complications. The aim of this report was to 
report on a case of a motocross competitor who developed chronic traumatic 
anterior instability of the sternoclavicular joint and underwent surgical 
reconstruction using the autogenous long palmar tendon. The patient was a 
33-year-old man with a history of anterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular 
subsequent to a fall during a maneuver in a motocross competition. Conservative 
treatment was instituted initially, consisting of use of a functional sling to 
treat the symptoms for 3 weeks, along with physiotherapeutic rehabilitation for 
3 months. We chose to use a modification of the "figure of eight" technique 
based on the studies by Spencer and Kuhn. A longitudinal incision of 
approximately 10 cm was made at the level of the sternoclavicular joint. The 
graft from the ipsilateral long palmar tendon was passed through the orifices in 
the form of a modified "figure of eight" and its ends were sutured together. The 
patient was immobilized using an American sling for 4 weeks. After 6 months of 
follow-up, the patient no longer presented pain or instability when movement of 
the sternoclavicular joint was required. Minor discomfort and slight prominence 
of the sternoclavicular joint continued to be present but did not affect the 
patient's activities. Thus, the patient was able to return to racing 6 months 
after the operation. Our study presented a case of chronic anterior dislocation 
of the sternoclavicular joint that was successfully treated by using a 
modification of the "figure of eight" reconstruction technique. This technique 
was shown to be safe and effective, and it allowed the patient to fully return 
to his sports activities.

Publisher: As luxações esternoclaviculares representam menos de 5% de todas as 
luxações da cintura escapular. A maioria dos casos de luxação anterior da 
articulação esternoclavicular não apresenta sintomas. Entretanto, alguns 
pacientes podem desenvolver instabilidade anterior crônica e permanecer 
sintomáticos. Nesses casos é indicado o tratamento cirúrgico. A literatura é 
escassa em relação à reconstrução com uso do tendão palmar longo nos casos de 
instabilidade anterior traumática. Embora raras, essas lesões merecem 
diagnóstico rápido e tratamento eficaz para evitar complicações futuras. O 
objetivo deste trabalho foi relatar um caso de um atleta de motocross que 
evoluiu com instabilidade anterior traumática crônica da articulação 
esternoclavicular e foi submetido a reconstrução cirúrgica com o uso do tendão 
palmar longo autógeno.Paciente masculino, 33 anos, com história de luxação 
anterior da articulação esternoclavicular após queda durante manobra em um 
campeonato de motocross. Inicialmente foi empregado o tratamento conservador, 
com uso de tipoia funcional por três semanas, e sintomático, além da 
reabilitação com fisioterapia por três meses. Optamos por usar uma modificação 
da técnica do “oito”, baseados nos estudos de Spencer e Kuhn. A incisão 
longitudinal de aproximadamente 10 cm foi feita no nível da articulação 
esternoclavicular. O enxerto do tendão palmar longo ipsilateral foi passado 
pelos orifícios em forma de “oito” modificado e suas extremidades foram 
suturadas conjuntamente. O paciente foi imobilizado com tipoia americana por 
quatro semanas. No fim de seis meses de seguimento não apresentava dor ou 
instabilidade quando solicitada a articulação esternoclavicular. Um discreto 
desconforto e ligeira saliência da articulação esternoclavicular permaneceu, mas 
não afetaram suas atividades, o que permitiu ao paciente voltar às pistas de 
corrida com seis meses de pós-operatório. Nosso estudo apresentou um caso de 
luxação anterior crônica da articulação esternoclavicular tratado com sucesso 
com o uso de uma modificação da técnica de reconstrução em “oito”. Essa técnica 
mostrou ser segura e eficaz e permitiu um retorno total às atividades esportivas 
do paciente.

During social interaction, humans prefer to keep a certain distance between 
themselves and other individuals. This preferred 'interpersonal distance' (IPD) 
is known to be sensitive to social context, and in the present study we aimed to 
further investigate the extent to which IPD is affected by the specific type of 
social interaction. In particular, we focused on the contrast between joint 
actions, where two or more individuals coordinate their actions in space and 
time to achieve a shared goal, and parallel actions, where individuals act 
alongside each other but individually. We predicted that joint action would be 
associated with a smaller preferred IPD compared to parallel action. 
Additionally, given that this research took place in the midst of the COVID-19 
pandemic, we aimed to assess whether IPD preferences are affected by 
individuals' concerns about infection in general, as well as COVID-19 in 
particular. We predicted that higher individual concerns would be associated 
with greater preferred IPD. To test these hypotheses, we asked participants to 
imagine different social scenarios (involving either joint or parallel actions 
alongside a stranger) and indicate, on a visual scale, their preferred IPD. The 
results of two experiments (n = 211, n = 212) showed that participants preferred 
a shorter distance when they imagined acting jointly compared to when they 
imagined acting in parallel. Moreover, participants who reported higher 
discomfort for potential pathogen contact and who were more aware of the 
COVID-19 context in which the study took place preferred a larger IPD in 
general. Our results provide further evidence that different types of social 
interaction shape IPD preference. We discuss potential reasons for this 
phenomenon and highlight remaining questions for future research.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral fish cartilage 
hydrolysate (FCH) on symptoms and joint tissue structure in rat developing 
osteoarthritis induced surgically. Osteoarthritis was induced in the right knee 
of mature male Lewis rats (n = 12/group) by surgical transection of the anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACLT) combined with partial medial meniscectomy (pMMx). Two 
weeks after surgery, rats were treated orally with either control (sterile H2O) 
or FCH for four weeks. Pain and function were assessed by dynamic weight-bearing 
test (incapacitance test), electronic Von Frey (EVF; hindpaw allodynia 
threshold), and pressure algometer (knee allodynia threshold). Time and groups 
differences at each time point were evaluated using a mixed model. The 
histological features were evaluated eight weeks after surgery using OARSI 
score. Mann-Whitney test nonparametric test was applied to compare OARSI score. 
ACTL/pMMx surgery significantly reduced weight-bearing and increased allodynia 
and sensitivity thresholds of the operated paw/knee. Globally, FCH improved 
these parameters faster, but no significant difference between control and FCH 
groups was observed. Eight weeks after surgery, rats developed moderate OA 
lesions. Compared with control, FCH did not significantly modify OA lesion 
severity assessed using the OARSI score. In this mechanically induced OA model, 
4 weeks of supplementation with FCH had no significant effect on cartilage 
lesion, but tends to accelerate pain relief and joint function recovery. This 
positive trend may have opened the way for further investigation of FCH as 
potential treatment of joint discomfort associated with OA.

CONTEXT: The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyaan) intends to "converge" 
nutrition-related program components across sectors (nutrition, health, water, 
and sanitation). In this study, we have examined the perspectives of Anganwadi 
workers (AWWs), the frontline workers of the Integrated Child Development 
Services, on working in convergence with the public health sector.
METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study was done between June 2018 and June 
2019 in two urban informal settlements in Mumbai. We conducted in-depth 
interviews with 26 AWWs and their supervisors, purposively sampled and 
diversified in terms of age, education, and years of experience. We used the 
software NVivo version 12 to aid analysis.
RESULTS: Most AWWs acknowledged that a convergent framework of action between 
"nutrition" and "health" was likely to be beneficial to the community. However, 
they also shared that cross-sector convergence was currently limited due to 
technical unfamiliarity with "health-sector" issues in the frontline, discomfort 
with data sharing, and lack of meaningful incentives for joint work. Broader 
organizational challenges such as poor infrastructure and lack of supervision, 
as well as challenges in the urban context (migration and cultural barriers) 
further hindered joint activities.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that critical structural gaps in the urban 
setup of ICDS need to be addressed and AWWs need to be better familiarized with 
the changing roles expected from them under POSHAN Abhiyaan. To work better with 
the health sector, the work timings of AWWs need to be aligned with those of the 
health sector and meaningful financial incentives need to be put in place for 
cross-sector activities.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The change in anatomy and physiology resulting from radical 
mandible surgery is often exacerbated by radiation therapies that make the 
mucosa atrophic and susceptible to irritation and ulceration rendering the task 
of areating functional complete dentures for edentulous subjects very 
challenging to prosthodontists. The aim of this study is to describe an implant 
supported denture rehabilitation in an edentulous hemimandibulectomized patient 
with a singular prosthetic design in order to compensate for the lack of a 
condylar process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subject of the clinical case, had a history of 
squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsillar region for which it was subjected 
to a hemimandibulectomy and was primarily rehabilitated with an over denture 
mounted onto a bar furnished by a resin condylar eminence in articulation with 
the glenoid fossa of the upper denture. The need to provide greater 
stabilization for the upper prosthesis led to a maxillary implant insertion and 
to the realization of a new joint connection that was constituted inferiorly by 
a titanium condyle and superiorly by a teflon acetabulum.
DISCUSSION: The prosthetic balance guaranteed by the second rehabilitation 
greatly affected the biomechanics of mastication leading to a reduction of 
eccentric interferences, a stabilization of centric occlusion, and a lowering of 
intensity contraction by masticatory muscles. This difference is well 
represented by two and three-dimensional plans obtained from the application of 
a T-Scan III device.
CONCLUSIONS: The rehabilitative solution proposed was effective in resolving the 
lateral deviation, in relieving masticatory and speech discomfort, as well as 
restoring an aesthetically acceptable appearance in a hemimandibulectomized and 
not reconstructed patient.

BACKGROUND Osteogensis imperfecta (OI) is a rare disorder associated with 
brittle bones, skeletal deformities, short stature, and conductive hearing loss. 
It is caused by mutations in genes encoding collagen type I production and is 
associated with multiple fractures occurring during a patient's lifetime. 
Atypical fractures can occur without a history of previous injury or diagnosis. 
CASE REPORT A 52-year old man sustained a fall from his own height. He 
experienced pelvic pain but could bear weight. He was referred to the hospital 
by his primary care physician and was admitted to the Orthopedic Department with 
a pelvic ring fracture. We performed open reduction and internal fixation with a 
reconstruction plate via an intrapelvic approach. At 12 weeks after discharge, 
he sustained a peritrochanteric fracture. It was surgically treated with a 
dynamic hip screw. The patient commenced weight-bearing 20 weeks after the 
initial procedure. Bone union was achieved clinically and radiographically. He 
did not have any revision procedures. At the time of this report, 5 years after 
the described period, he felt no discomfort around the hips, sacroiliac joints, 
and pubic symphysis. CONCLUSIONS OI poses a difficult treatment challenge, but, 
achieving a good clinical and functional result is possible with a precise 
surgical technique and meticulous preoperative planning. Clinicians should 
always consider the possibility of a simultaneous fracture occurrence in 
different parts of the body. Some patients present without a previous diagnosis, 
and we should always have some suspicion of OI in cases of young patients 
presenting with low-energy fractures.

BACKGROUND Traditional plaster (TP) is a widely used auxiliary fixation (AF) 
approach for postoperative fracture patients. However, patient discomfort and 
inconvenience to clinicians has limited its application. We introduce a novel 
instant 3-dimensional printing appliance system (3D-AS) to address such issues. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-seven postoperative fracture patients were divided 
randomly between a TP group and a 3D-AS group, and analyzed retrospectively. 
Radiographic images during follow-up were evaluated for fracture healing and 
fracture reduction quality. The range of motion (ROM) was recorded to assess 
motor performance. Patient pain was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale 
(VAS). Complications were also compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The 
patients comprised 17 men and 10 women with ages ranging from 21 to 69 years 
(mean age: 47.35). All patients completed a follow-up visit (range: 14-19 
months, mean: 13.59 months). Although no significant difference was found 
between general characteristics (P>0.05) and the time of fracture union 
(P>0.05), significant differences between groups were seen in complications 
(P<0.05), VAS (P<0.01), patient satisfaction (P<0.05), and ROM for the upper 
joints (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that 3D-AS provides better 
upper-limb ROM and more comfortable healing for postoperative fracture patients, 
indicating that it can be recommended for use in such patients.

Human falls pose a serious threat to the person's health, especially for the 
elderly and disease-impacted people. Early detection of involuntary human gait 
change can indicate a forthcoming fall. Therefore, human body fall warning can 
help avoid falls and their caused injuries for the skeleton and joints. A simple 
and easy-to-use fall detection system based on gait analysis can be very 
helpful, especially if sensors of this system are implemented inside the shoes 
without causing a sensible discomfort for the user. We created a methodology for 
the fall prediction using three specially designed Velostat®-based wearable feet 
sensors installed in the shoe lining. Measured pressure distribution of the feet 
allows the analysis of the gait by evaluating the main parameters: stepping 
rhythm, size of the step, weight distribution between heel and foot, and timing 
of the gait phases. The proposed method was evaluated by recording normal gait 
and simulated abnormal gait of subjects. The obtained results show the 
efficiency of the proposed method: the accuracy of abnormal gait detection 
reached up to 94%. In this way, it becomes possible to predict the fall in the 
early stage or avoid gait discoordination and warn the subject or helping 
companion person.

BACKGROUND: Most bone metastases are observed in the trunk of the body. 
Metastasis in the mandibular condyle is rare. In many case reports, temporary 
common temporomandibular joint disorder-like symptoms can be a sign of relapse 
and metastasis.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of breast carcinoma metastatic to the 
left mandibular condyle in a 55-year-old Japanese woman, who visited our 
department for a dental check-up prior to chemotherapy. She had almost no 
symptoms, but radiographs suggested the existence of metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: In many case reports, patients had some symptoms. In this case 
report, our patient had slight symptoms, but we were able to confirm the 
metastasis from the symptoms and panoramic dental radiograph. When patients 
complain about discomfort of the temporomandibular joint, we need to consider 
the possibility of metastasis and notice changes on the panoramic dental 
radiograph.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis is a common cause of orofacial pain with 
distressing symptoms. The patients most commonly females are often anxious and 
worried due to the typical gritty sound produced during chewing moments. In 
other cases there is pain followed by decreased mouth opening. Currently the 
treatment is not standardised though the clinicians are treating these disorders 
either by oral medications; splintage or by injections. Though local injection 
of Triamcinolone acetonide and Hyaluronic acid is an innovative therapy yet it 
is elusive of much research. The main aim of the present study is to evaluate 
the efficacy of with Triamcinolone acetonide and Hyaluronic acid in treating 
temporomandibular joint arthritis. The present study is a prospective non 
randomized clinical trial of 100 patients in a tertiary referral centre. The 
patients diagnosed with temporomandibular joint arthritis were treated with 
local infiltration of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide along with 20 mg of 
hyaluronic acid; one injection every week for 4 weeks. The pre-treatment and 
post-treatment data was compared using student paired t test and Mann-Whitney U 
test. Majority of the patients showed relief in symptoms like pain (87/96) and 
clicking sounds (81/88) and the difference was statistically significant 
(p < 0.05). Though other symptoms like restrictive mouth opening; discomfort on 
lateral and medial movement were also relieved in 9/15 patients and 21/23 
patients respectively however the difference was not statistically significant. 
We highly recommend the use of Triamcinolone acetonide and hyaluronic acid 
injection in TMJ arthritis as it helps in relieving pain and clicking of sound 
in majority of the patients. The treatment is an out-patient department 
procedure with almost no side effects in most of the patients. The cost 
effectiveness of the treatment is another benefit.

Acromegaly is a disorder characterized by hypersecretion of growth hormone, 
resulting in morbidities associated with multiple systems. Although most of the 
morbidities are reversed following control of the underlying disease, it may 
take several weeks to months for the symptoms to subside. One of the most 
noticeable effects of acromegaly is changes in facial features and jawbone 
growth, which can lead to severe pain and discomfort. This report describes a 
case of a 31-year-old patient with acromegaly induced bilateral condylar 
hyperplasia who presented with severe temporomandibular joint (TMJ), facial 
pain, and degenerative changes in TMJ. The patient was treated by 
trans-sphenoidal excision of pituitary adenoma, medications, and radiotherapy, 
but his hormonal levels were persistently high. Considering the refractory 
nature of the disease, the patient underwent bilateral high condylectomy, right 
articular disc removal, and abdominal dermis fat grafting. The surgery arrested 
the progressive mandibular enlargement and prevented further degenerative 
changes of TMJ. Although there was some reduction in TMJ pain, the myogenous 
pain and headache persisted after surgery. TMJ surgery may be selectively used 
for refractory cases of acromegaly and those requiring discectomy or total joint 
replacement. This case report describes the role of TMJ surgery in the 
management of morbidities and symptoms associated with TMJ in acromegaly until 
biochemical normalcy is achieved.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis resulting in joint 
discomfort and disability, culminating in decline in life quality. Attention has 
been drawn in recent years to disease-associated molecular biomarkers found in 
readily accessible biofluids due to low invasiveness of acquisition and their 
potential to detect early pathological molecular changes not observed with 
traditional imaging methodology. These biochemical markers of OA have been found 
in synovial fluid, blood, and urine. They include emerging molecular classes, 
such as metabolites and noncoding RNAs, as well as classical biomarkers, like 
inflammatory mediators and by-products of degradative processes involving 
articular cartilage. Although blood-based biomarkers tend to be most studied, 
the use of synovial fluid, a more isolated biofluid in the synovial joint, and 
urine as an excreted fluid containing OA biomarkers can offer valuable 
information on local and overall disease activity, respectively. Furthermore, 
larger clinical studies are required to determine relationships between 
biomarkers in different biofluids, and their impacts on patient measures of OA. 
This narrative review provides a concise overview of recent studies of OA using 
these four classes of biomarkers as potential biomarker for measuring disease 
incidence, staging, prognosis, and therapeutic intervention efficacy.

Adventitial cystic disease (ACD) of the veins is a rare vascular disease. Most 
cases of venous ACD are located adjacent to the joint area, such as the common 
femoral, external iliac, and popliteal veins. To the best of our knowledge, 67 
cases of venous ACD have been reported, and ACD of the superficial femoral vein 
(SFV) has never been reported. Herein, we report the case of a 57-year-old male 
who presented with swelling and discomfort in the left leg. Computed tomography 
venography revealed multiple cystic lesions in the left distal SFV. The patient 
underwent cyst excision, which relieved the compression in the vein, although 
mild stenosis prevailed in the SFV. After a week, thrombosis developed in the 
popliteal vein. The thrombosis resolved after three months of anticoagulant 
therapy, and the patient showed no recurrence of ACD during three years of 
follow-up.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to report a case of a plexiform 
neurofibroma (PNF) in the pelvic region treated with sweet bee venom (SBV) and 
mountain ginseng pharmacopuncture (MGP).
METHODS: A 16-year-old girl was diagnosed as having PNFs, neurofibromatosis type 
1, 10 years ago and she had surgery three times to remove the benign tumors, but 
the growth of the PNFs continued. She has been treated in our clinic with SBV 
and MGP two times per month from March 2010 to April 2014. SBV was injected 
intra-subcutaneously at the borders of the PNFs in the pelvic region, and MGP 
was administrated intravenously each treatment time.
RESULTS: The growths of the PNFs occurred rapidly and continued steadily before 
treatment. Since March 2010, she has been treated in our clinic, and the growths 
of the PNFs have almost stopped; further-more, the discomfort of hip joint pain 
has been reduced, and her general condition has improved.
CONCLUSION: We cautiously conclude that SBV and MGP treatment has some effects 
that suppress the growth and the spread of the PNFs in this patient.

Due to the life-prolonging effects of combination antiretroviral therapy, many 
people with HIV are living longer. However, this enhanced longevity is often 
mirrored by increased disability resulting from HIV and/or the adverse effects 
of medication. Management of HIV-positive patients is further complicated by 
comorbidities related to aging, including bone and joint disorders. In this 
paper, we describe the nonsurgical management of an HIV-positive patient with 
premature onset of severe osteonecrosis of the knee. A 50-year-old man who had 
been HIV-positive for 16 years and on combination antiretroviral therapy for 11 
years presented to his family physician with extreme discomfort in his right 
knee. He was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the right knee, but resisted total 
knee arthroplasty because of potential complications under anesthesia related to 
comorbid advanced liver disease. Instead, a successful combination of 
non-surgical management strategies was employed by the patient and his health 
care team.

BACKGROUND: Noise exposure is considered a stressor that may potentially exert 
negative health effects among the exposed individuals. On a population basis, 
the most prevalent and immediate response to noise is annoyance, which is an 
individually experienced phenomenon that may activate physiological 
stress-responses and result in both physical and mental symptoms. Health 
implications of traffic noise have been investigated thoroughly, but not of 
neighbour noise. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations 
between neighbour noise annoyance and eight different physical and mental health 
symptoms.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Danish Health and Morbidity Survey 2017 
were used. The present study included a random sample of 3893 adults living in 
multi-storey housing. Information on neighbour noise annoyance and various 
health symptoms (e.g. pain in various body parts, headache, sleeping problems, 
depression, and anxiety) during the past two weeks was obtained by 
self-administered questionnaires. The question on neighbour noise annoyance and 
health symptoms, respectively, had three possible response options: 'Yes, very 
annoyed/bothered', 'Yes, slightly annoyed/bothered', 'No'. The associations 
between neighbour noise annoyance and very bothering physical and mental health 
symptoms were investigated using multiple logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Being very annoyed by neighbour noise was significantly associated with 
higher odds of being very bothered by all eight health symptoms (adjusted 
OR = 1.73-3.32, all p-values < 0.05) compared to individuals not annoyed by 
noise from neighbours. Statistically significant interactions were observed 
between sex and two of the eight health symptoms. Among women, a strong 
association was observed between neighbour noise annoyance and being very 
bothered by pain or discomfort in the shoulder or neck, and in the arms, hands, 
legs, knees, hips or joints. Among men, no associations were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings from this study, neighbour noise annoyance is 
strongly associated with eight different physical and mental health symptoms. 
Future studies are encouraged to 1) determine the direction of causality using a 
longitudinal design, 2) explore the biological mechanisms explaining the 
sex-specific impact of neighbour noise annoyance on symptoms of musculoskeletal 
pain or discomfort and the other outcomes as well.

The authors describe a case of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation 
(SANT) of the spleen treated at the 2(nd) Department of Surgery, Jagiellonian 
University, Medical College. The patient was a 23-year-old woman. Clinically she 
presented with 2-year history of recurrent mild fever, diffuse joint pain, 
abdominal discomfort and iron deficiency anaemia of chronic disease. The 
laboratory tests revealed a non-characteristic chronic inflammatory response. A 
splenic solid lesion 9 cm in diameter was found on abdominal computed 
tomography. The patient underwent uneventful laparoscopic resection of the upper 
half of the splenic parenchyma. The resected tumour showed characteristic 
histological and immunophenotypical findings of SANT as previously described in 
the literature. In long-term follow-up, improvement of preoperative symptoms and 
abnormalities in the blood tests was documented.

Gaucher's disease is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of 
adult patients with hepatosplenomegaly and increased serum ACE. A 19-year-old 
girl presented with recurrent epigastric and left hypochondrial pain over a 
period of 9 years, associated with episodes of nausea and diarrhoea. She was 
extensively investigated and found to have splenomegaly and raised serum ACE. A 
screen for haematological disorders was negative. She reported an insect bite 
during an overseas holiday preceding her symptoms. She was therefore also 
screened for infectious causes of hepatosplenomegaly but without success. Later 
on in life, she reported joint pain and discomfort. Sarcoidosis was thought to 
be the putative cause on more than one occasion. However, the presence of 
splenomegaly and her relatively young age, led the rheumatologist to the correct 
diagnosis.

Muscle injuries generally occur in two-joint muscles with a high percentage of 
type II fibers during the performance of eccentric activity. Some muscle 
injuries, such as those located in the adductor longus, a monoarticular muscle, 
as well as rectus abdominis do not fully comply with these requirements. This 
study examines five cases of elite handball players with ruptured rectus 
abdominals. Sonographically, lesions in rectus abdominis are shown as a 
disruption of the fibrillar pattern with a hematic suffusion that invades the 
entire lesion. In some of the cases, the ultrasound study was complemented with 
a MRI. A unified rehabilitation protocol was applied and the return to play time 
of each handball player ranged between 16 and 22 days, with an average of 18.2 
days. Follow-up at 15 months showed no evidence of re-injury or residual 
discomfort and all of them are playing at their highest level. The aim of this 
study was to illustrate a feature of handball injury that, as in tennis and 
volleyball, is uncommon and so far has not been specifically reported. The 
phenomenon of contralateral abdominal hypertrophy in handball appears in the 
dominant arm as in tennis and volleyball.

BACKGROUND: Comminuted manubrium sterni fractures are rare, and internal 
fixation methods are limited. This report explored a practical and feasible 
method of internal fixation for comminuted manubrium sterni fractures.
CASE SUMMARY: A 17-year-old female was injured in a car accident for which she 
underwent debridement and suturing of her head and anterior chest wounds in 
another hospital. Eight days later, the patient was transferred to our hospital 
for surgical treatment. The manubrium sterni was found intraoperatively to be 
split into three irregular fragments with obvious overlap and separation 
displacement. Meanwhile, a manubriosternal joint dislocation and left first rib 
cartilage fracture were observed. The retraction force of the shape-memory alloy 
staples was used to pull the fracture fragments together. Two more titanium 
locking plates were then used to fix the manubrium sterni and corpus sterni 
longitudinally, and the left first rib cartilage fracture was repositioned and 
fixed with a titanium locking plate. A postoperative computed tomography scan 
showed reduced and rigid fixation of the comminuted manubrium sterni fractures. 
The patient recovered well with no significant complaints of discomfort. The 
patient was discharged 10 days postoperatively after the stitches had been 
removed.
CONCLUSION: Shape-memory alloy staples had the advantage of being safe and 
effective during the repositioning and internal fixation of comminuted manubrium 
sterni fractures. Therefore, they provided a new surgical option for comminuted 
manubrium sterni fractures.

BACKGROUND: Pressure-related skin lesions on the digits are a significant cause 
of discomfort. Most foot pain related to ill-fitting shoes occurs in the 
forefoot and digital areas. Pain has been associated with poor shoe fit, reduced 
toe box volume, as well as contour and shape of the shoe Off-the-shelf 
medical-grade footwear is designed as an intervention for chronic lesions on the 
digits. These shoes are designed with a flexible neoprene fabric upper that is 
thought to reduce pressure on the forefoot and reduce discomfort associated with 
ill-fitting shoes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an 
off-the-shelf, medical-grade shoe on dorsal digital pressure and perceived 
comfort when compared to participant's own preferred shoe.
METHODS: Thirty participants (18 females, 12 males) scored their perceived 
comfort whilst wearing each footwear style using a visual analog comfort scale. 
Dorsal digital and interdigital pressures were measured in using the 
WalkinSense® in-shoe pressure system. Sensors were placed on predetermined 
anatomical landmarks on the digits. Participants were randomly assigned the test 
shoe and their own shoe. Once wearing the shoe, the participants walked across a 
6 m walkway and pressure data from each sensor was collected and processed to 
obtain peak pressure, time to peak pressure and contact time.
RESULTS: Participants scored the test shoe with higher comfort points than their 
own footwear. Overall peak pressure, pressure time integral and contact time 
decreased, whilst the time taken to reach peak pressure increased across all 
anatomical landmarks whilst wearing the test shoe. Statistically significant 
changes were observed for all of the measured variables relating to pressure on 
the medial border of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
CONCLUSION: The test shoe provided greater comfort and reduced the amount of 
pressure on the forefoot. The medical-grade footwear therefore, is a viable 
alternative to custom made prescription footwear and is more suitable than a 
regular everyday shoe when treating digital lesions associated with pressure.

BACKGROUND: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by 
progressive calcification of spinal tissues; however, the impact of 
calcification on pain and function is poorly understood. This study examined the 
association between progressive ectopic spine calcification in mice lacking 
equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1-/-), a preclinical model of DISH, 
and behavioral indicators of pain.
METHODS: A longitudinal study design was used to assess radiating pain, axial 
discomfort, and physical function in wild-type and ENT1-/- mice at 2, 4, and 
6 months. At endpoint, spinal cords were isolated for immunohistochemical 
analysis of astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (IBA1), and nociceptive innervation 
(CGRP).
RESULTS: Increased spine calcification in ENT1-/- mice was associated with 
reductions in flexmaze exploration, vertical activity in an open field, and 
self-supporting behavior in tail suspension, suggesting flexion-induced 
discomfort or stiffness. Grip force during the axial stretch was also reduced in 
ENT1-/- mice at 6 months of age. Increased CGRP immunoreactivity was detected in 
the spinal cords of female and male ENT1-/- mice compared to wild-type. GFAP- 
and IBA1-immunoreactivity were increased in female ENT1-/- mice compared to 
wild-type, suggesting an increase in nociceptive innervation.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that ENT1-/- mice experience axial discomfort 
and/or stiffness and importantly that these features are detected during the 
early stages of spine calcification.

BACKGROUND: Patients are often concerned about returning to sports after total 
hip arthroplasty (THA).
PURPOSE: To (1) evaluate sports participation and motivation rates in a large 
cohort of patients who underwent uncemented THA with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings 
and (2) determine whether patients' participation was associated with their 
motivation for each sport, preoperative demographics, or patient-reported 
outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: We surveyed 1310 patients (aged <75 years) who underwent uncemented 
ceramic-on-ceramic THA and collected levels of motivation and participation for 
22 different sports as well as patient-reported outcome measure scores. A total 
of 1042 patients (1206 hips) returned questionnaires; the mean age at index 
surgery was 60.6 ± 8.8 years.
RESULTS: At least 51% of patients participated regularly or frequently in at 
least 1 light sport, 73% in at least 1 moderate sport, and 20% in at least 1 
strenuous sport. Sports participation was strongly correlated with motivation (r 
= 0.97, P < .001) but not with level of discomfort (r = 0.22, P = .292). 
Participation in strenuous sports was significantly associated with age, body 
mass index, and sex. There were significant differences among patients who 
practiced various categories of sports as determined using the Oxford Hip Score 
(P = .008), but not with regard to the Forgotten Joint Score (P = .054).
CONCLUSION: Only 20% of patients practiced strenuous sports regularly or 
frequently after THA, regardless of pain or discomfort. Participation in sports 
after THA is strongly correlated with motivation but not with level of 
discomfort. Longer term studies with a greater focus on complications and 
survival are necessary to determine whether high-impact sports compromise 
patient safety or implant longevity.

This study investigated the impact of blood flow restriction (BFR) during 
treadmill walking on gait kinematics. Twenty-one participants completed one 
familiarisation and four experimental sessions, including two walking speeds 
(moderate [5.0 ± 0.3km·h-1] and fast [6.4 ± 0.4km·h-1]) and two occlusion 
conditions (BFR [60% of arterial occlusion pressure] and unrestricted). For each 
exercise intensity, the BFR session was performed first. Participants were 
instructed to walk as long as possible, with sessions capped at 20 min. 
Unrestricted sessions were time-matched, and the order of exercise intensity was 
randomised. Kinematics were collected over 10s every minute using 
retro-reflective markers affixed to specific body landmarks. Ratings of 
perceived exertion and discomfort were collected every two minutes. Blood 
samples were collected from the fingertip pre-exercise and the finger and toe 
post-exercise, and were analysed for lactate, electrolytes, and markers of 
cell-membrane damage. During the BFR sessions the cuffs remained inflated while 
the blood samples were collected. Fast-walk BFR sessions exhibited higher 
anterior trunk flexion (p = 0.001) and knee flexion during stance (p = 0.001) 
compared to all other sessions. Step width was increased during BFR sessions 
(p = 0.001), but no difference in step length (p = 0.300) or cadence (p = 0.922) 
were observed. The time required to elicit change in anterior trunk flexion and 
plantar-flexion angle at toe-off was shorter during BFR sessions (p = 0.024). 
The BFR sessions elicited the highest ratings of perceived exertion and 
discomfort, as well as blood lactate concentration (p ≤ 0.001). Application of 
BFR during moderate and fast treadmill walking modifies gait kinematics and 
exacerbates exercise-related sensations as well as blood lactate concentration.

Plain Language Summary: Applying blood flow restriction changes walking 
kinematics, causing an overall increase in anterior trunk flexion and knee 
flexion during stance while simultaneously reducing plantar-flexion angle at 
toe-off and ankle joint velocity.Applying blood flow restriction exacerbate 
exercise-related sensations of exertion and discomfort.Sample site does not 
influence the level of post-exercise blood lactate or markers of cell-membrane 
potential and damage.

OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMSP) in 
school going children and its impact on daily life.
METHODS: One thousand eighteen apparently healthy school children aged 5-16 
years were assessed and analysed for IMSP and its associated problems. Standard 
tests for significance were applied.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five (16.2%) children mostly males (55.2%) 
reported IMSP. Lower limbs (52.1%) were the most common location of pain. More 
than 1 year of pain history was present in 15%. Thirty-seven percent children 
complained of discomfort during walking, 30.9%, had pain during physical 
exercise, 29.2% had difficulty attending lessons and 4.2% had interference in 
pursuing hobbies. The children were also further sub grouped into preadolescents 
and adolescents. There was significant difference in pain duration and duration 
of each pain episode in the two groups (p=0.01). A significant number of 
children (21.2%) with IMSP reported school absenteeism (p<0.001). A significant 
number of adolescents had history positive for contact sports (p=0.001). Sleep 
disturbances were also reported to be higher in children with IMSP (29% vs. 
5.7%, p=0.001). Other associated problems in children with IMSP found were day 
time tiredness (51.1%), headache (47.3%) and abdominal pain (24.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of IMSP in school children aged 5-16 yrs was found to be 
16.2% and a significant percentage of these children experience interference 
with daily activities including school absenteeism.

(1)Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.

This is a case report detailing the use of in-office needle arthroscopy (mi-eye 
2™) in a patient with chronic knee pain and inconclusive magnetic resonance 
imaging findings. The patient is a 40-year-old male who presented to our clinic 
after an extended history of right knee pain along the medial aspect with 
previous failed treatments. Magnetic resonance imaging without contrast had 
demonstrated full-thickness chondral fissuring of the lateral patellar facet, 
mild abnormal signals of the proximal patellar tendon and Hoffa's fat pad, and 
intact anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament. The patient 
was previously treated with an ultrasound-guided injection of 2 cm3 of 1% 
lidocaine without epinephrine and 1 cm3 of Kenalog-40 and scheduled for 
follow-up. At follow-up, clinical examination showed antalgic gait, minimal 
tenderness along medial joint line, medial pain in deep flexion, and no pain 
when in varus or valgus. Due to continued discomfort with a negative magnetic 
resonance imaging, in-office diagnostic arthroscopy was performed using mi-eye 2 
revealing a tear of the mid-body of the medial meniscus. The patient 
subsequently underwent arthroscopic repair and is recovering well with complete 
resolution of medial joint pain. This report highlights the clinical utility of 
in-office diagnostic arthroscopy in the management of patients with persistent 
knee pain and negative or equivocal findings on magnetic resonance imaging.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: The treatment preference for neglected elbow 
dislocation is by open reduction and lengthening the tricep muscle. If the 
dislocation is not reduced for more than 6 months, degenerative resorption would 
have occurred. We did total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) with a tricep turn-down 
flap for the management in this case. The use of a tricep flap for tricep 
shortening after unreduced elbow dislocation has been reported in previous 
publications but none used a turn-down flap.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 82-year-old woman came to the orthopedic outpatient clinic 
with pain and discomfort on her right elbow. The arm affected by the injury was 
her dominant hand, restricting her from farming and leisure activities. 
Exploration findings confirmed the presence of a dislocated elbow with 
associated soft tissue complications. The cartilage was degeneratively 
destructed, and the tricep muscle was retracted.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: In our case, tricep shortening was managed with elongation 
using a turn-down flap. The lack of soft tissue layers and thin fibrous fascias 
results in tension-vulnerable TEA surgical wounds. This is caused by the 
insufficient coverage of the joint, which leads to wound complications. Previous 
studies of turn-down flap procedures showed good flap survival and functional 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Tricep turn-down flap could be an option for tricep lengthening 
procedures in unreduced neglected elbow joint dislocation.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, degenerative, and progressive disease of 
articular cartilage, producing discomfort and physical disability in older 
adults. Thirteen percent of elderly people complain of knee OA. Management 
options for knee OA could be divided into the following categories: 
conservative, pharmacological, procedural, and surgical. Joint replacement is 
the gold standard, reserved for severe grades of knee OA, due to its 
complications rate and increased risk of joint revision. A nonsurgical approach 
is the first choice in the adult population with cartilage damage and knee OA. 
Yearly, more than 10% of knee OA-affected patients undergo intra-articular 
injections of different drugs, especially within three months after OA 
diagnosis. Several molecules, such as corticosteroids injection, hyaluronic acid 
(HA), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), are managed to reduce the symptoms of 
patients with knee OA. The aim of this review was to offer an overview of 
intra-articular injections used for the treatment of OA and report the 
conventional pharmacological products used.

OBJECTIVE:  This study was conducted to assess the effects of applying a gel 
of combined glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate on the temporomandibular 
joint (TMJ) area in patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion treated by 
removable functional appliances in terms of TMJ internal proportions, levels of 
pain, and tension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 36 patients aged 10-13 years with 
skeletal Class II malocclusion due to retrusion of the mandible characterized 
by: 4-8 degrees of the sagittal skeletal discrepancy (ANB) angle, 4-7 mm of 
overjet, 72-76 degrees of the sagittal mandibular positioning (SNB) angle, and a 
bone maturity stage located at pubertal growth spurt. Patients were distributed 
to the experimental group (Twin-Block appliance + Jointance® gel) or the control 
group (conventional treatment with the Twin-Block appliance). An allocation 
ratio of 1:1 was employed. Pre- and post-treatment digital lateral cephalometric 
radiograms were taken, and the TMJ joint spaces were measured using the Viewbox 
software (dHAL Software, Kifissia, Greece). The pain and discomfort levels were 
evaluated using a questionnaire with a four-point Likert scale at three 
assessment times.
RESULTS:  The anterior and posterior glenoid and anterior condylar distances to 
the pterygoid vertical (PTV) reference plane significantly decreased after 
treatment (p<.001), and the anterior joint space decreased significantly 
(p<.001). In contrast, the superior distance of the condyle to the Frankfort 
horizontal reference plane increased significantly after treatment, and the same 
results were found for the posterior and superior joint spaces (p<.05). There 
were no significant differences between the two groups in the evaluated linear 
variables. No significant differences were found when comparing pain and tension 
levels between the two groups at each assessment time. A gradual decrease in 
pain and tension levels was observed between the three evaluation times in both 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS:  A combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate did 
not affect the temporomandibular joint spaces, pain, and tension levels in 
patients with skeletal Class II malocclusions treated by removable functional 
appliances.

CASE SUMMARY: A 9-year-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat was referred for 
assessment of a chronic non-weightbearing left forelimb lameness that had an 
acute onset following a suspected cat bite to the distal limb 4 weeks 
previously. There was minimal improvement following conservative management. On 
examination there was discomfort on palpation of the left palmar metacarpal 
region. An orthopaedic examination performed under sedation identified a 
moderate effusion of the left fourth metacarpophalangeal joint. A CT scan was 
performed, which identified fragmentation of the medial palmar sesamoid of the 
fourth digit (sesamoid V). Arthrocentesis of the fourth metacarpophalangeal 
joint identified septic inflammation. Surgical removal of the fragmented palmar 
sesamoid was performed and was submitted for histopathology and bacteriology 
analysis. Postoperative CT confirmed the removal of all fragments. Pasteurella 
species were isolated from the sesamoid fragments. Histopathology revealed 
osteomyelitis, neutrophilic inflammation and multifocal necrosis, with evidence 
of fibrosis present. The cat was re-examined 3 months postoperatively, at which 
point there was no evidence of lameness and orthopaedic examination of the limb 
was unremarkable.
RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported 
case of fragmentation of a palmar sesamoid in a cat. This case study describes 
the diagnosis and the successful management of a cat with fragmentation of a 
palmar sesamoid, following an altercation with another cat.

INTRODUCTION: Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (OFMT) is an uncommon soft tissue and 
bone neoplasm with just over 100 cases being reported in the literature. They 
present as small, slow-growing asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules in the soft 
tissues of the trunk and extremities.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of a 25-year-old, right hand dominant 
gentleman who complained of a seven-year history of pain and discomfort in the 
dorsal aspect of the right thumb. He was unable to move his interphalangeal 
joint (IPJ) but had good function otherwise. Examination revealed a localized 
tender swelling over the dorsal aspect of the IPJ. The thumb was fixed in 
extension. X-ray revealed marked abnormal soft tissue swelling around the 
interphalangeal joint, cystic abnormalities and new bone formation. Biopsy 
showed fibrous tissue containing nodules of tumor with cells in a myxoid 
background, rounded and histiocytoid to elongated and spindle shaped. CD57, type 
IV collagen, smooth muscle actin were found and CD56 and EMA were focally 
positive. These were in keeping with ossifying fibromyxoid tumor with an 
atypical immunophenotype.
DISCUSSION: The tumor was formally excised with the flexor pollicis longus 
tendon. A two-month review revealed his pain had settled. As the tumor had an 
atypical immunophenotype he was referred to the regional sarcoma team.
CONCLUSION: OMFT can present with atypical clinical, radiological and 
histological features. It is managed in a multidisciplinary setting and often 
requires lifetime follow up to detect a recurrence given the uncertain nature of 
these lesions.

INTRODUCTION: Lipomas are the most common benign mesenchymal tumors. The 
intra-articular localization is exceptional.We report the first case of an 
intra-articular osteolipoma at the elbow.
CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old patient with no pathological history, presented to 
the emergency room with a two weeks history of a painless, progressively left 
elbow swelling in a context of apyrexia.Physical examination revealed a hot, 
edematous left elbow. The gentle mobilization of the joint was painless. 
Biologie was normal. Initial radiograph showed a well-defined lobular image. 
Ultrasound revealed an anechoic intra-articular collection associated to a 
synovium hyperaemia and the MRI shows an aspect of synovitis. An arthrotomy was 
done via an internal approach of the elbow. Joint fluid was red. A free ossified 
intraarticular mass was discovered. Bacteriological samples were sterile. 
Histological examination concluded to an osteolipoma with no histological signs 
of malignancy. At the last 3-year follow-up, the patient didn't report any pain 
or functional discomfort. Elbow mobility was complete, with the absence of 
recurrences.
DISCUSSION: Osteolipoma is defined as a histological variant of lipoma having 
undergone bone metaplasia. Allen found 06 cases in a series of 635 lipomas over 
five years. Pain has not been reported in the literature. In our case the pain 
was explained by the interposition of the tumoral mass between the articular 
surfaces. Histological examination confirms the diagnosis and recurrences are 
rare.
CONCLUSION: Osteolipoma is an extremely rare entity of mesenchymal tumors whose 
intra-articular location, although exceptional, does not worsen the prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Simple and safe fingertip reconstruction methods involve the use of 
local neurovascular islands flaps that can preserve functional length and 
sensitivity, and reconstruction with skin of the same texture. However, 
techniques involving flaps have numerous drawbacks and do not satisfy all the 
requirements for fingertip reconstruction. A particular problem is the 
persistence of contracture deformity due to lack of full flap advancement. We 
present a new technique using uni-pedicled volar rotational advancement flap 
with large Z-plasty, and describe the results of long-term follow-up.
METHODS: From October 1993 to December 2009, 112 fingers of 98 patients were 
covered with uni-pedicled volar rotational advancement flap with large Z-plasty 
after sustaining various types of injuries or finger pulp avulsion. A 
longitudinal incision was made along the lateral border of the digit and a large 
neurovascular volar flap was elevated just above the pulleys and flexor tendon 
sheath. To release tension, a large Z-plasty was applied at the 
metacarpophalangeal joint or interphalangeal joint crease. The final patient 
outcomes were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: All fingertip injuries were treated without flap necrosis. Partial 
wound dehiscence was observed in two patients and average static two-point 
discrimination was 5.2 mm. There were no postoperative contracture deformities, 
joint stiffness, paresthesia, or hypersensitivity. Most patients were left with 
acceptable scarring and were free of postoperative pain and cold intolerance 
during the long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel technique provides durable, completely sensate, and 
well-vascularized coverage of the fingertip with minimal discomfort to patients.

BACKGROUND: In the context of breast cancer, axillary web syndrome (AWS), also 
called lymphatic cording, typically presents in the weeks after axillary 
surgery. This painful condition, likely lymphofibrotic in origin, restricts 
upper extremity range of motion (ROM). There is no established treatment, 
although physical therapy and other approaches have been used to variable 
effect. This report describes treatment of a female client with AWS, who had 
recently undergone a unilateral simple mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy plus 
axillary dissection.
METHODS: The client presented with pain upon movement (self-reported as 5 on the 
0-10 Oxford Pain Scale), visible cording and restricted use of the ipsilateral 
upper extremity. Clinical assessment included determining the extent of AWS 
cording (taut, from axilla to wrist) and measuring glenohumeral joint ROM (140° 
flexion by goniometer). A therapeutic massage with movement protocol, termed 
dynamic angular petrissage, was administered over two sessions: Swedish massage 
combined with dynamically taking the limb through all possible angles of 
movement (passive ROM), controlling stretch and tension while simultaneously and 
segmentally applying petrissage and non-petrissage techniques to the underlying 
soft tissue. Careful attention was taken to not break the cord. Home care 
consisted of prescribed exercises performed by the patient.
RESULTS: After Session One, pain was reduced (to 0/10), ROM improved (to 170° 
flexion), and cording was visibly reduced. After Session Two the cord was 
residually apparent only on hyperextension, with no ROM restrictions in 
glenohumeral joint flexion. Follow-up at three months revealed absence of visual 
or palpable evidence of cording, unrestricted glenohumeral joint ROM, and 
absence of movement-associated pain.
CONCLUSION: The signs and symptoms of AWS were quickly and effectively 
eliminated, without causing any pain or discomfort to the client. We propose 
that dynamic angular petrissage may be an efficient and safe treatment approach 
for reducing the pain, mobility restrictions, and cording of AWS.

BACKGROUND: Femoral head avascular necrosis is the cause of paralyzing status of 
youth population. Initial diagnosis is the main element in treating the disease. 
Bone grafting and core decompression are the approved cures at the early steps 
of the disease. Hip replacement in a total manner is the common cure in the 
final stages. The optimal treatment in the intermediate stages is partially 
disputable. We investigated several patients with femoral head osteonecrosis 
cured with impacted cancellous allograft and open core decompression using the 
lightbulb technique.
METHODS: A total of 46 patients (58 hips) suffering from femoral head 
osteonecrosis were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. Patients were 
classified into two groups: A (stage 2B Ficat) and B (stage 3 Ficat) to be 
treated with the impaction of cancellous allograft and by open core 
decompression. Radiographic results, demographic data, and range of hip joint 
motions were recorded. The patients were assessed through employing the Harris 
hip score (HHS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) index prior to operation and 
over five years following surgery. We also studied radiographic alterations of 
femoral head.
RESULTS: The means of HHS and VAS were developed following the operation. 
Radiographic outcomes promoted in both groups, however, it was better in group 
A. 12 (40%) and six (22%) hips (40%) in groups A and B, respectively displayed 
developed stages following the operation. The hip ROM was enhanced with the mean 
of 15-20 degrees (P<0.005).
CONCLUSION: Open core decompression combined with allograft impaction sounds to 
be influential in the developing steps of femoral head necrosis and leads to 
joint discomfort and diminished pain improving ROM of the hip joint and 
meanwhile procrastinating the worsening of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Synovial osteochondromatosis is a benign metaplastic proliferative 
disorder of the synovium characterised by the formation of multiple 
cartilaginous nodules in the synovium, many of which detach and become loose 
bodies. The disease is characteristically monoarticular, most commonly involving 
the knee. A site in the elbow was first reported in 1918 by Henderson, but any 
joint may be involved. Very few cases of synovial osteochondromatosis of the 
elbow have been reported in the literature. The presenting symptoms are usually 
diffuse discomfort in the affected joint and decreased range of motion with an 
accompanying gritty or locking sensation. The treatment of choice is excision of 
the synovium and removal of the loose bodies.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare neglected case covering a 32-year period of 
a locally aggressive synovial osteochondromatosis of the elbow in a 47-year-old 
man. Clinical examination revealed a significant increase in size of the left 
elbow compared to the contralateral one. The simple radiographs and the computed 
tomography showed multiple rounded, calcified bodies widespread throughout the 
elbow joint. At surgery we removed and counted a total of 312 loose bodies, 
varying in size from a few millimeters to 3 cm. The evaluation at 6 months 
postoperatively showed marked reduction in the volume of the elbow, improvement 
of extension and flexion and an increase of the Mayo elbow performance score 
from 50 points before surgery to 80 points at 6 months postoperative.
CONCLUSION: Synovial osteochondromatosis is an uncommon condition characterized 
by the formation of multiple nodules of hyaline cartilage within the 
sub-synovial connective tissue. The differential diagnosis includes chronic 
articular infection, osteoarthritis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, 
mono-articular inflammatory arthritis and periarticular neoplasms like synovial 
sarcoma. The treatment of choice is excision of the synovium and removal of the 
loose bodies. The prognosis is good, but recurrences may occur if the removal is 
incomplete.

INTRODUCTION: Application of biofeedback techniques in rehabilitation has turned 
into an exciting research area during the recent decade. Providing an 
appropriate visual or auditory biofeedback signal is the most critical 
requirement of a biofeedback technique. In this regard, changes in Surface 
Electromyography (SEMG) signals during wrist movement can be used to generate an 
indictable visual biofeedback signal for wrist movement rehabilitation via SEMG 
biofeedback. This paper proposes a novel methodology for selecting the most 
appropriate features out of wrist muscle SEMG signals.
METHODS: To this end, the surface EMG signals from flexor and extensor muscle 
groups during wrist joint movements were recorded and analyzed. Some linear and 
nonlinear features in frequency, time, and time-frequency domains were extracted 
from the recorded surface EMG signals of the flexor and extensor muscles. 
Experiments and analyses were performed on ten healthy subjects and four stroke 
patients with wrist muscle spasticity as the movement disorder subjects. Some 
heuristic feature selection measures were applied. The main motivation behind 
choosing applied heuristic feature selection measures was meeting. In the first 
step, the designed visual biofeedback signal should indicate a healthy wrist 
motion profile as its successful tracking by the patient guarantees 
rehabilitation. In addition, the visual biofeedback signal should be a smooth 
curve thus preventing the patient from discomfort while tracking it on a monitor 
during the biofeedback therapy.
RESULTS: In this pilot study, after using the introduced feature selection 
measures, quantitative and qualitative analyses of the extracted features 
indicated that Shannon entropy is the most appropriate feature for generating a 
visual biofeedback signal as a healthy wrist motion profile to improve the 
ability of stroke patients in controlling wrist joint motion. In addition, it 
was shown that when the wrist joint moves between a flexed and rest position, 
the flexor muscle EMG signal should be used for generating a visual biofeedback 
signal. However when the wrist joint moves between a rest position and an 
extended position, the extensor muscle EMG signal is appropriate for providing a 
visual biofeedback signal. It is worth noting that the achieved pilot study 
results should be confirmed by the future studies with larger samples.
CONCLUSION: According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that among 
the analyzed features, the Shannon entropy was the most appropriate feature. It 
can be employed for generating a visual biofeedback signal for reduction of 
spasticity in patients with stroke.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Joint pain afflicts millions of adults worldwide. The effect 
of a bone morphogenetic protein complex on joint pain is assessed in this study.
METHODS: We compared the impact of a dietary supplement protein complex 
(Cyplexinol®) and placebo in 18 men and women (aged 43 ± 10 years) with 
self-reported joint pain. Subjects were randomly assigned to each condition, 
consumed twice daily for 14 days (900 mg/day). Subjects completed questionnaires 
(e.g., Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 
and subjective pain using a visual analog scale [VAS]) at the start and end of 
each treatment phase. Blood samples were analyzed for bone morphogenic protein 
(BMP), alkaline phosphatase, and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, 
interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, IL-1β, and TGF-β). Blood was also collected on days 1 
and 15 to determine the acute impact of treatment on these measures.
RESULTS: Pain and discomfort scores improved (P ≤ 0.05) for subjects following 
use of Cyplexinol® but not placebo. Improvements were noted for WOMAC pain (P = 
0.05), stiffness (P = 0.039), and total pain (P = 0.026), as well as VAS pain (P 
= 0.015), recreational activity interference (P = 0.023), mood interference (P = 
0.012), and total pain (P = 0.024). A trend was noted for WOMAC physical 
function (P = 0.052). An approximate 50% increase in BMP5 was noted following 
Cyplexinol® (P = 0.01), with a similar increase noted for placebo (P = 0.022). A 
near doubling in TGF-β (P = 0.001) was noted for Cyplexinol®. No other changes 
of significance were noted across time, nor were any differences noted in 
cytokines following acute intake of the conditions (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Cyplexinol® can alleviate joint pain in middle-aged men and women, 
while elevating BMP5 and TGF-β. Cyplexinol® does not influence cytokines, at 
least within a short 2-week supplementation period or within the 2-h 
post-ingestion period.
RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Individuals suffering with joint pain in the knee and/or 
hip may benefit from daily use of Cyplexinol®, as we observed decreased pain and 
stiffness following treatment.

Objective: Management of calcaneal wounds is challenging due to a paucity of 
tissue, complex local anatomy, and limited vascularity. These wounds are 
commonly associated with lower extremity fractures, which are often treated with 
external fixation. Free tissue transfers are frequently employed as a means for 
closure of plantar heel wounds; however, postoperative management can be 
challenging due to their dependent location. We sought to describe how simple 
modification of the external fixator can help relieve direct pressure, provide 
joint immobilization, and optimize accessibility necessary for flap survival. 
Methods: Three patients requiring autologous free tissue reconstruction of 
hindfoot defects were immobilized using an external fixator with a "kickstand" 
modification. Viability of the transferred tissue and the postoperative outcomes 
were assessed. Results: All free flaps survived with no associated 
complications. The "kickstand" modification was well tolerated with minimal 
discomfort. All 3 patients expressed satisfaction with early return to 
ambulation. Conclusion: An external fixator with a "kickstand" modification 
provides an essential function in maintaining the viability of the transferred 
tissue to plantar calcaneal wounds.

Juvenile Tillaux fractures are Salter-Hallis III fractures of the distal tibial 
epiphysis that occur only when the tibial epiphyses are closing. Theoretically, 
arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of a juvenile Tillaux fracture 
can facilitate the accurate reconstruction of the articular surface, using 
arthroscopic visualization. We treated a girl aged 14 years who had a juvenile 
Tillaux fracture by using arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation. In 
order to obtain articular congruency, the screw was inserted under arthroscopic 
visualization. Although the screw was placed through the epiphysis, the patient 
had no symptoms of discomfort and the functional results were excellent. We 
performed a second operation to remove the implant 9 months later. During this 
procedure, arthroscopy indicated the healing of the fracture site and an intact 
articular surface. At the 1.5 year follow-up, the radiograph indicated that the 
epiphysis was closed normally and that the patient had no symptoms. The American 
Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was 100, or excellent. Although 
screw insertion into the epiphysis should be avoided, reconstructing the 
congruency of the joint surface is of higher priority in repairing the 
epiphysis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of whole greenshell mussel (GSM) powder on 
biomarkers of cartilage metabolism, inflammatory cytokines, and joint symptoms 
in postmenopausal women with overweight/obesity and joint discomfort.
DESIGN: Fifty-five postmenopausal women with overweight/obesity were randomly 
assigned to receive 3 g/day whole GSM powder or placebo for 12 weeks. Cartilage 
turnover biomarkers urinary C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) and serum 
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were measured at baseline, week 6 and 
12. Plasma cytokines were measured at baseline and week 12. Joint pain and 
knee-related problems were assessed at baseline and week 12 using a 100 mm 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
(KOOS) questionnaire, respectively.
RESULTS: Forty-nine participants completed the study (GSM n = 25, placebo n = 
24). After 12 weeks, urinary CTX-II showed no significant change over time or 
between the groups (interaction effect P = 0.1). However, in women with 
symptomatic knees, a significant difference was noted between the group 
(treatment effect P = 0.04), as it was lower in the GSM group compared to 
placebo group at week 6 (P = 0.04) and week 12 (P = 0.03). Serum COMP and plasma 
cytokines were not affected. GSM supplementation showed greater reduction in the 
VAS pain score than placebo (-13.2 ± 20.3 vs. -2.9 ± 15.9; P = 0.04). No 
significant change in KOOS domains between the two groups was observed.
CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation of whole GSM powder at 3 g/day may slow down 
the degradation of type II collagen in postmenopausal women with symptomatic 
knees. GSM treatment conferred clinical benefit on overall joint pain. No 
significant effect was noted for inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that GSM may 
act within the joint microenvironment rather than at the systemic level.

Aneurysm of the coronary artery is an uncommon condition that is usually found 
incidentally. The left coronary aneurysm is the least common. We report the case 
of a young patient with a history of vasculitis who was found to have a left 
fusiform coronary aneurysm. This is a 20-year-old female who has a history of 
polyarteritis nodosa and who came due to shortness of breath associated with 
chest discomfort. The physical exam was only relevant for multiple joint pains 
and tenderness. An echocardiogram showed a possible coronary aneurysm that was 
confirmed on the angio-tomography. The patient was discharged without 
complications. The left main coronary artery aneurysm is a rare condition and 
the least common of the coronary aneurysms. There is no established guideline 
for screening and therapy of these aneurysms, but invasive methods are not a 
preferred method for follow-up on this condition.

Morphea, also referred to as localized scleroderma, is a rare inflammatory 
disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It has been reported in both kids 
and adults with equal frequency. Morphea encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical 
variants ranging from solitary skin lesions with minimal discomfort to severe 
subtypes like generalized or linear morphea. Morphea symptoms are usually 
limited to the skin and the subcutaneous tissue. Still, extracutaneous 
involvement is reported in approximately 22% of patients, with linear and 
generalized subtypes in a cohort reported by Zulian et al. Localized scleroderma 
can rarely cause debilitating lesions, which result in joint contractures, limb 
growth defects, and other extracutaneous features in children. Morphea 
encompasses a wide variety of clinical phenotypes, which makes its 
classification challenging. The most commonly used classification was described 
by Laxer and Zulian, which includes circumscribed morphea, linear morphea, 
generalized morphea, pan-sclerotic and mixed subtype. Circumscribed morphea is 
the most common variant and further differentiated into superficial and deep 
variants. In one cohort study, circumscribed morphea was responsible for 60-65% 
of the patients. The liner morphea includes the limb or head variant based on 
the location of the lesion. One of the most current classifications was 
developed in 2017 by the European dermatology forum (EDF). The predominant 
subtypes of the disease distinguished in the EDF classification are generalized 
type, limited type, linear type, deep type, and mixed type.

INTRODUCTION: Elbow instability following non-reconstructible capitellum 
fracture could be a source of severe pain and discomfort. There are limited 
treatment options to address this which include either a total elbow replacement 
or radiocapitellar replacement. However, these can be challenging in elderly 
patient with low bone stock. We present such a case in a patient who was managed 
with reconstruction of capitellum using freeze-dried cadaveric allograft.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian female sustained a comminuted 
capitellar fracture. She was taken to theater for fixation of fracture, however, 
in view of severe communition, it was found to be non-reconstructible and hence 
had to be excised. She continued to have symptoms of pain and instability. She 
was treated with freeze-dried allograft from cadaveric bone to reconstruct the 
capitellum. Five months following surgery, she had no pain and achieved 
functional range of motion. At her final follow-up at 2 years, she remained 
asymptomatic and had full range of motion at elbow joint.
CONCLUSION: Capitellum reconstruction using allograft showed excellent result in 
short term in our patient. Ours is the first case report of using an allograft 
to reconstruct capitellum following severely comminuted, non-reconstructible 
capitellum fracture following trauma in elderly patient with osteoporotic bone.

Acute calcific tendinitis of the longuscolli is a self-limiting inflammatory 
condition caused by calcium hydroxyapatite deposition in the longuscolli tendon. 
Although several case reports have described its radiological presentation, few 
reports provide detailed chronological accounts through symptomatic and 
radiologic resolution. A 59-year-old woman presented with severe neck pain and 
stiffness of a few days duration as well as moderate discomfort when swallowing. 
Lateral radiographs revealed a large calcium deposit anterior to the C1.C2 joint 
and swelling of the prevertebral soft tissue from C1 to C5. CT and magnetic 
resonance imaging showed fluid in the retropharyngeal gap.A soft collar and 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug were prescribed, without antibiotics. At 4 
months after presentation, the calcium deposit and all symptoms had resolved 
completely. Although this disease is comparatively rare, physicians should keep 
it in mind when a patient presents with acute severe neck pain.

Osteochondroma is one of the most common benign bone tumors, mainly involving 
the bone ends of long bones, and involving the spine is rare. It often involves 
the competing, followed by the thoracic and lumbar spine, and rarely involves 
the sacrum. We report the imaging findings of a solitary osteochondroma of the 
sacrum. The patient was a 37-year-old woman who presented clinically with 
progressive low back pain associated with left buttock pain and discomfort. CT 
and MRI showed that the lesion originated from the left lamina of S1 and grew 
anteriorly and superiorly, resulting in compressive resorption of the L5 
vertebral bone, left foraminal stenosis and adjacent nerve root swelling. The 
patient underwent surgery and the mass was completely excised and recovered well 
postoperatively. Osteochondroma arising from the sacrum is rare and can lead to 
compressive resorption of adjacent bone, and imaging techniques are conducive to 
the localization and characterization of the lesion and provide useful 
information for clinical treatment.

Osteochondroma is the most common benign tumor of the growing bone that commonly 
involves the knee joint region. Hereby we present a case of an arthroscopic 
resection of a symptomatic intra-articular osteochondroma of the knee. A 
32-year-old woman presented with diffuse and persistent pain of her right knee 
followed by discomfort for over three months. She did not report any history of 
injury or any other medical problem. Physical examination and imaging, with 
plain radiographs and MRI, revealed a bony mass arising from the supero-lateral 
aspect of her right distal femur without a stalk. This bone tumor, an 
osteochondroma, was arthroscopically resected and the diagnosis was confirmed by 
the histologic examination. The arthroscopic resection of this benign tumor led 
to complete relief of the symptoms of the patient and her return to daily and 
athletic activities in one month postoperatively. No recurrence of symptoms 
occurred during the seven-year follow-up period. Arthroscopic resection of a 
symptomatic osteochondroma is less painful, more cosmetically accepted, and can 
result in a quicker recovery than the traditional approach with an open 
incision.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a 21-year-old female with previously 
diagnosed neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with neck, scapular, lumbar, and 
temporomandibular discomfort along with headaches.
CLINICAL FEATURES: The patient had chronic tightness and pain in the 
cervicothoracic region as well as pain in the lumbar spine at the site of prior 
neurofibroma removal. Radiographs demonstrated multilevel osseous changes. In 
addition to NF-1, she was diagnosed with cervical myalgia, tension-type 
headaches, and chronic temporomandibular joint disorder.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: Treatment consisted of a course of manual therapy 
including cervical flexiondistraction, myofascial release, patient education on 
workplace ergonomics, and an at-home active care plan. The patient experienced a 
reduction in pain and headache frequency.
SUMMARY: Manual therapy in the form of cervical flexion-distraction with 
myofascial release and education on workplace ergonomics were effective in 
reducing neck and thoracic pain as well as reducing headache frequency in a 
21-year-old with NF-1.

INTRODUCTION: Craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare hereditary bone disease 
presenting metaphyseal widening of the tubular bones, sclerosis of craniofacial 
bones and bony overgrowth of the facial and skull bones. Craniometaphyseal 
dysplasia occurs in an autosomal dominant (AD) and an autosomal recessive (AR) 
form.
CASE REPORT: We present a 32-year-old patient arrived at our unit in May 2009. 
His main discomfort was a major limitation of the mouth opening, in the context 
of a craniofacial deformity. Relying on patient's medical history and the 
performed diagnostic tests, the diagnosis of craniometaphyseal dysplasia was 
made.
CONCLUSION: After careful evaluation of the clinical case, in accordance with 
the requirements of the patient, we opted for a surgical treatment aimed at 
correction of functional limitation of temporomandibular joint and aesthetic 
improvement of the facial bones. The stability of the clinical results led us to 
suggest and to undertake the surgical path, also due to the lack of safe and 
consolidated non-surgical treatments for the specific case.

Idiopathic hypertrophy of the masseter muscle is a rare disorder of unknown 
cause. Some authors associate it with the habit of chewing gum, 
temporo-mandibular joint disorder, congenital and functional hypertrophies, and 
emotional disorders (stress and nervousness). Most patients complain of the 
cosmetic change caused by facial asymmetry, also called square face, however, 
symptoms such as trismus, protrusion and bruxism may also occur. The goals of 
the present investigation were: to report a case of idiopathic masseter 
hypertrophy, describe its symptoms and treatment. The patient reported bilateral 
bulging in the region of the mandible angle, of slow and progressive evolution. 
He did not complain of pain or discomfort, however there was bilateral otalgia, 
nighttime trismus and stress. In his physical exam we noticed bilateral masseter 
hypertrophy without local inflammatory alterations. We indicated surgical 
treatment with an extraoral approach. Complementary tests are indicated when 
there is diagnostic doubts. Treatment varies from conservative to surgical, and 
the later depends on surgeon skill and experience.

BACKGROUND: The reverse sural artery (RSA) flap is widely used for lower 
extremity reconstruction. However, patients sometimes suffer from donor site 
complications such as scar contracture and paresthesia, resulting in 
dissatisfaction with the aesthetic outcomes. This study investigated the 
characteristics of donor site morbidity associated with RSA flaps and described 
our experiences of dealing with complications by performing resurfacing surgery 
using thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flaps.
METHODS: From April 2008 to August 2018, a total of 11 patients underwent 
contracture release and resurfacing surgery using TDAP flaps due to donor 
morbidity associated with RSA flaps. All affected donor sites were covered with 
a skin graft, the most common of which was a meshed split-thickness skin graft 
(six cases).
RESULTS: Eight of the 11 patients (72.7%) suffered from pain and discomfort due 
to scar contracture, and seven (63.6%) complained of a depression scar. The 
donor sites were located 6.3±4.1 cm below the knee joint, and their average size 
was 140.1 cm². After resurfacing using TDAP flaps, significant improvements were 
found in the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) scores and the active and 
passive ranges of motion (AROM and PROM) of the knee joint. The LEFS scores 
increased from 45.1 to 56.7 postoperatively (P=0.003), AROM increased from 
108.2° to 118.6° (P=0.003), and PROM from 121.4° to 126.4° (P=0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Planning of RSA flaps should take into account donor site 
morbidity. If complications occur at the donor site, resurfacing surgery using 
TDAP flaps achieves aesthetic and functional improvements.

INTRODUCTION: Complex fracture dislocations of the midfoot are uncommon. 
Improved outcomes have been demonstrated where it has been possible to restore 
and maintain the length and alignment of the medial column as well as the 
congruity of the articular surfaces. We present our experience with the use of 
angle-stable locking plates in the stabilisation of complex midfoot fracture 
dislocations.
METHODS: Twelve patients were identified on a prospective trauma database 
between 2003 and 2009. All fractures involved the medial column with four 
associated fracture subluxations of the lateral column also. Patients underwent 
open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with restoration of the medial column 
axis, reduction of the articular surface congruity and stabilisation with 
angle-stable locking plates.
RESULTS: There were no post-operative infections or neurological injuries. Ten 
of the twelve patients required metalwork removal. There were no implant 
failures prior to removal of the metalwork. At a mean follow-up of 12.4 months 
(range: 4-32 months), 11 patients had minimal symptoms of swelling, discomfort 
or stiffness in the midfoot. This did not restrict their daily activities. One 
patient developed post-traumatic arthritis and collapse of the medial 
longitudinal arch. Two patients declined removal of the metalwork.
CONCLUSIONS: Angle-stable locking plates provide satisfactory stabilisation 
following ORIF of complex midfoot fracture dislocations. Most patients will 
require removal of the metalwork. Following removal of metalwork, the majority 
of patients will maintain the length, alignment and stability of the midfoot.

A Bankart lesion is a common traumatic sports injury of the glenohumeral joint. 
When the shoulder is dislocated, the connective tissue surrounding the joint may 
tear or rupture. This study aimed to describe the initial dislocation, 
treatment, medical treatment, rehabilitation outcomes at 3 and 8 months, and 
return to daily life for three patients. Patient 1 was a 28-year-old male office 
worker who enjoyed fitness and weight training. His injury was sustained by a 
fall from his bicycle and subsequent performance of pull-up exercises. Surgery 
was recommended for repair of the anterior and inferior labrum tear. 
Reassessment of the surgery was performed after 2 months of rehabilitation. The 
patient was asked to exercise once a week at a rehabilitation center and to 
perform home-based exercises. In the first 2 months, the main exercise consisted 
of range of motion (ROM) exercises and stretching. Thereafter, muscle 
strengthening, using tubing, equipment and body weight exercises, and 
proprioceptive exercises were performed to gradually improve muscle strength and 
for return to daily activities. ROM progressively increased, with recovery of 
normal range at 2 months post-surgery. However, pain decreased only slightly, 
with a visual analog score of 6 out of 10 at 2 months post-surgery. At 8 months, 
the pain was bearable, without causing discomfort. Muscle strength remained 
almost unchanged initially but gradually recovered, although with a residual 
deficit of 20-30% in flexion, adduction and internal rotation. Considering the 
prolonged rehabilitation after surgery, future studies are warranted to analyze 
the long-term effects of non-surgical therapies by accumulating more cases and 
developing effective exercise rehabilitation programs.

Angular front limb deformity (ALD) refers to an excessively curved limb 
conformation, which is seen in some chondrodysplastic dog breeds. Common 
characteristics of ALD include carpal valgus (VALG), front limb rotation (ROT), 
elbow incongruity, and lateral radial head subluxation. These may cause lameness 
and discomfort in affected dogs. The clinical impact and breed-specific 
characteristics of front limb conformation in chondrodysplastic breeds are 
unknown. This prospective and cross-sectional study aimed to investigate 
differences in front limb conformation between three chondrodysplastic breeds. 
We further evaluate whether front limb conformation is associated with clinical 
findings and limb function. We propose novel methods to classify findings in the 
interosseous space and to quantify lateral radial head subluxation. Data from a 
total of 224 front limbs from 112 dogs of three chondrodysplastic dog breeds (30 
Standard Dachshunds, 29 Skye terriers, and 53 Glen of Imaal terriers) were 
included in the study. Front limb VALG and ROT were measured with a goniometer. 
From the radiographs, the elbow joint was graded for incongruity (INC), and the 
humeroradial angle (HRA) was measured to assess lateral radial subluxation. The 
association of front limb conformation with clinical signs and limb function was 
investigated using orthopedic examination, goniometric and kinetic measurements, 
and radiography. The breeds differed significantly in their front limb 
conformation. The Dachshund had the least ROT and the least radial head 
subluxation. The Skye terrier had the most VALG, the most radial head 
subluxation, and the largest prevalence of moderate and severe INC. The Glen of 
Imaal terrier had the most ROT. In addition, INC, ROT, VALG, and HRA were found 
to be independent of each other and were associated with several measurable 
clinical abnormalities and limb function such as pain, lameness, limited range 
of motion, and elbow joint osteoarthritis. This implies that VALG, ROT, and HRA 
could be used in addition to INC grading when choosing musculoskeletal 
characteristics of dogs suitable for breeding.

The elbow joint could be associated with degenerative processes of primary and 
post-traumatic aetiology. Among these, osteoarthritis may also be secondary to 
repeated use as well as trauma. Pain, discomfort and progressive loss of 
functionality are common signs of this condition. The evaluation of elbow 
osteoarthritis should comprise an in-depth study to detect the primary cause of 
the illness and to facilitate the decision-making process regarding personalized 
treatment. Discordance between clinical manifestations and radiological findings 
is common. Conservative approaches may provide symptomatic relief in the early 
stages of disease for most patients. The goal of the treatment is to reduce pain 
and ensure an adequate range of motion and proper functioning of the joint while 
preserving the anatomical structure, to postpone elbow arthroplasty 
interventions for as long as possible. According to treatment guidelines, 
surgery should be considered depending on aetiology and severity, patient age, 
and functional demands. This narrative review aims to investigate the current 
literature regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of primary and 
post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow.

Growing Pains.

Lehman PJ(1), Carl RL(1).

Author information:
(1)Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.

CONTEXT: The term growing pains describes a common, benign syndrome of recurrent 
discomfort that occurs in young children. First described in the 1800s, the 
etiology of this condition remains unclear. The peak incidence does not 
correspond to a time of rapid growth. Children typically report bilateral pain 
in the lower extremities that occurs late in the day or at night.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched using the keywords 
growing pains, benign nocturnal limb pains of childhood, recurrent limb pain of 
childhood, and limb pain in childhood. Articles were also found by reviewing 
references from the initial PubMed search. Only English-language articles 
published from 1900 through 2016 were included in the review.
STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.
RESULTS: When a patient's history is classic for growing pains and physical 
examination is normal, laboratory and radiographic evaluation are not needed to 
make the diagnosis. Findings typical for growing pains include bilateral lower 
extremity pain usually experienced in the early evening or at night. The pain is 
not caused by activity and will not cause a limp.
CONCLUSION: Additional workup is warranted for children with an atypical 
history, systemic symptoms, or for those individuals with physical examination 
abnormalities such as allodynia, focal tenderness, joint swelling, or decreased 
joint range of motion. Management of growing pains generally consists of 
symptomatic care with massage and over-the-counter analgesics, as well as 
reassurance to children and parents about the benign, self-limited nature of 
this condition. This review article summarizes data on the epidemiology, 
etiology, and management of growing pains and provides a framework for 
distinguishing this entity from other causes of extremity pain.

Up to 50% of breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitor therapy report 
musculoskeletal symptoms such as joint and muscle pain, significantly impacting 
treatment adherence and discontinuation rates. We conducted a secondary data 
analysis of a nationwide, multi-site, phase II/III randomized, controlled, 
clinical trial examining the efficacy of yoga for improving musculoskeletal 
symptoms among breast cancer survivors currently receiving hormone therapy 
(aromatase inhibitors [AI] or tamoxifen [TAM]). Breast cancer survivors 
currently receiving AI (N = 95) or TAM (N = 72) with no participation in yoga 
during the previous 3 months were randomized into 2 arms: (1) standard care 
monitoring and (2) standard care plus the 4-week yoga intervention (2x/week; 75 
min/session) and included in this analysis. The yoga intervention utilized the 
UR Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS©(®)) program consisting of breathing 
exercises, 18 gentle Hatha and restorative yoga postures, and meditation. 
Musculoskeletal symptoms were assessed pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, 
AI users reported higher levels of general pain, muscle aches, and total 
physical discomfort than TAM users (all P ≤ 0.05). Among all breast cancer 
survivors on hormonal therapy, participants in the yoga group demonstrated 
greater reductions in musculoskeletal symptoms such as general pain, muscle 
aches and total physical discomfort from pre- to post-intervention than the 
control group (all P ≤ 0.05). The severity of musculoskeletal symptoms was 
higher for AI users compared to TAM users. Among breast cancer survivors on 
hormone therapy, the brief community-based YOCAS©® intervention significantly 
reduced general pain, muscle aches, and physical discomfort.

© intervention significantly reduced general pain, muscle aches, and physical 
discomfort.

BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common and therefore managed 
by dentists on a daily basis. However, patients with TMD consistently go 
undetected and therefore untreated in dentistry. The reasons for these 
shortcomings have not been fully explored, specifically with regard to patients' 
perspectives. Therefore, this study aimed to explore patients' experiences of 
TMD and related treatment, with special focus on the experiences of having TMD, 
factors related to seeking care, and perspectives on received treatment.
METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit adult patients at the Public 
Dental Health services (PDHS) in the Region of Västerbotten, Sweden, during 
2019. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using 
Qualitative Content Analysis. Sixteen patients were interviewed (ten women and 
six men, 20-65 years). The interviews probed the patients' perspectives of 
having TMD, seeking care, and receiving treatment. All participants were also 
examined according to the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) and qualified for 
at least one DC/TMD diagnosis.
RESULTS: The data analysis led to the main theme Seeking care when the situation 
becomes untenable, but dental care fails to meet all needs. The patients 
expressed worry and social discomfort because of the symptoms but still strived 
to have an as normal daily life as possible. However, severe symptoms and 
associated consequences compelled them to seek professional help. Experiences of 
distrust together with challenges to access the PDHS were identified and related 
to the patients' unfulfilled expectations.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients' reported experiences indicate that receiving timely and 
appropriate care is more of an unfulfilled expectation than the current state of 
management of patients with TMD in dentistry.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive inflammatory disorder characterized 
by swollen joints, discomfort, tightness, bone degeneration and frailty. 
Genetic, agamogenetic and sex-specific variables, Prevotella, diet, oral health 
and gut microbiota imbalance are all likely causes of the onset or development 
of RA, perhaps the specific pathways remain unknown. Lactobacillus spp. 
probiotics are often utilized as relief or dietary supplements to treat bowel 
diseases, build a strong immune system and sustain the immune system. At 
present, the action mechanism of Lactobacillus spp. towards RA remains unknown. 
Therefore, researchers conclude the latest analysis to effectively comprehend 
the ultimate pathogenicity of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the functions of 
probiotics, specifically Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus acidophilus, in 
the treatment of RA in therapeutic and diagnostic reports. RA is a chronic 
inflammation immunological illness wherein the gut microbiota is affected. 
Probiotics are organisms that can regulate gut microbiota, which may assist to 
relieve RA manifestations. Over the last two decades, there has been a surge in 
the use of probiotics. However, just a few research have considered the effect 
of probiotic administration on the treatment and prevention of arthritis. 
Randomized regulated experimental trials have shown that particular probiotics 
supplement has anti-inflammatory benefits, helps people with RA enhance daily 
activities and alleviates symptoms. As a result, utilizing probiotic 
microorganisms as therapeutics could be a potential possibility for arthritis 
treatment. This review highlights the known data on the therapeutic and 
preventative effects of probiotics in RA, as well as their interactions.

OBJECTIVE: To report and assess the usefulness of ultrasound (US) findings for 
occult fractures of growing bones.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For six years, US scans were performed in children 
younger than 15 years who were referred with trauma-related local pain and 
swelling of the extremities. As a routine US examination, the soft tissue, 
bones, and adjacent joints were examined in the area of discomfort, in addition 
to the asymptomatic contralateral extremity for comparison. Twenty-five occult 
fractures in 25 children (age range, five months-15 years; average age, 7.7 
years) were confirmed by initial and follow-up radiograms, additional imaging 
studies, and clinical observation longer than three weeks.
RESULTS: The most common site of occult fractures was the elbow (n = 9, 36%), 
followed by the knee (n = 7, 28%), ischium (n = 4, 16%), distal fibula (n = 3, 
12%), proximal femur (n = 1, 4%), and humeral shaft (n = 1, 4%). On the 
retrograde review of the routine radiographs, 13 out of the 25 cases showed no 
bone abnormalities except for various soft tissue swelling. For the US findings, 
cortical discontinuity (direct sign of a fracture) was clearly visualized in 23 
cases (92%) and was questionable in two (8%). As auxiliary US findings (indirect 
signs of a fracture), step-off deformities, tiny avulsed bone fragments, 
double-line appearance of cortical margins, and diffuse irregularity of the bone 
surfaces were identified.
CONCLUSION: Performing US for soft tissue and bone surfaces with pain and 
swelling, with or without trauma history in the extremities, is important for 
diagnosing occult or missed fractures of immature bones in pediatric-aged 
children.

BACKGROUND: Canine breed conformation may interfere with locomotion and may 
predispose to orthopedic disease. Bulldogs have a high incidence of orthopedic 
diseases such as hip dysplasia. Kinetic gait analysis provides an objective way 
to assess and analyze locomotion. The aim of this study was to study the 
vertical forces of English Bulldogs during walk using a pressure sensitive 
walkway. We hypothesize that Bulldogs affected by orthopedic diseases have 
decreased weight bearing and asymmetric locomotion in the limbs despite having 
mild to no sings during clinical examination. Thirty English Bulldogs were 
tested. Peak vertical force, vertical impulse, rate of loading, stance phase 
duration, symmetry index, goniometry and incidence of orthopedic diseases were 
recorded.
RESULTS: Although none of the dogs showed signs of pain or discomfort upon 
manipulation of the hip joints, all dogs had radiographic evidences of hip 
dysplasia and lack of significant peak vertical force, vertical impulse and 
stance time differences. The dogs had a mean hind limb symmetry index of 
19.8 ± 19.5% and rates of loading ranged from 1.0 to 3.1.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of evident decrease in weight bearing, subclinical 
lameness can be inferred. The examined dogs had a mean hind limb symmetry index 
of 19.8 ± 19.5%. Symmetry indices reported in dogs free from orthopedic diseases 
range from 0.3 to 9.6%. Given non-lame dogs are expected to have a symmetry 
index close to 0%, data from this study suggests that Bulldogs have gait 
dysfunctions, which translates into hind limb asymmetries and rate of loading 
was consistent with severe hip dysplasia despite no visible signs of gait 
dysfunction. Future studies comparing lame and non-lame Bulldogs are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and diagnostic findings as well as management of 
adhesive capsulitis in dogs.
BACKGROUND: Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a syndrome 
defined by loss of range of motion of the shoulder and may be the end-stage 
manifestation of several primary conditions.
EVIDENTIARY VALUE: This is a case series report of eight dogs with chronic 
forelimb lameness diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis.
METHODS: Medical records (June 1, 2010-September 1, 2015) including, physical 
examination findings, radiographic findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
findings, arthroscopy findings, and treatment plans were reviewed.
RESULTS: All dogs presented with a chronic, grade III-VI/VI forelimb lameness. 
On orthopedic examination, all dogs had moderate to significant discomfort on 
shoulder extension and flexion and severe restriction of range of motion. Six of 
the eight dogs had evidence of bone remodeling and sclerosis in the affected 
shoulder on radiographs. Six of the dogs had an initial diagnostic ultrasound 
performed, which revealed evidence of fibrous scar tissue. Five dogs had MRI 
performed that revealed moderate shoulder effusion and enhancement of the 
synovial lining of the shoulder. Arthroscopy was performed in five of the eight 
patients. Three were noted to have significant contracture, adhesions, and 
fibrous scar tissue of the joint capsule. Severe inflammation was noted 
throughout the synovium of two patients. All eight patients tried conservative 
management consisting of oral medications and rehabilitation therapy. Five of 
the eight patients received extracorporeal shockwave therapy. Three patients 
received regenerative medicine treatment in the affected supraspinatus and 
shoulder. Regardless of the treatment elected, none of the dogs were reported to 
have significant improvement.
CONCLUSION: Adhesive capsulitis is an uncommon cause of chronic forelimb 
lameness. Further investigation is needed to describe the etiology and 
pathogenesis of adhesive capsulitis in dogs to evaluate the effectiveness of 
both non-surgical and surgical treatment modalities, establish treatment 
protocols, and evaluate short- and long-term clinical outcome of patients.
APPLICATION: Adhesive capsulitis should be considered in patients with chronic 
forelimb lameness and moderate to significant discomfort and restriction on 
shoulder range of motion.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term effectiveness of talonavicular joint 
arthrodesis and calcaneus osteotomy in the treatment of Müller-Weiss disease.
METHODS: Between June 2015 and February 2017, 14 patients diagnosed Müller-Weiss 
disease, who were ineffective on conservative treatment, were treated with 
talonavicular joint arthrodesis and calcaneus osteotomy. There are 3 males and 
11 females, with an average age of 46.2 years (range, 35-56 years). According to 
the Maceira grading criteria, 5 patients were rated as stage Ⅲ and 9 patients as 
stage Ⅳ. The disease duration ranged from 4 to 12 years (mean, 7 years). 
Preoperative X-ray films showed that all patients were not accompanied with 
adjacent joint arthritis. The hindfoot axis on Saltzman view was (9.8±2.8)°, 
calcaneal pitch angle (CPA) on lateral position was (14.7±5.1)°, Meary angle on 
lateral position was (4.8±2.8)°, and talar 1 meta-tarsal angle (T1MA) on 
anteroposterior position was (25.0±7.3)°. Preoperative visual analogue scale 
(VAS) score was 5.9±1.5, American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society (AOFAS) 
ankle-hindfoot score was 58.8±17.6.
RESULTS: All patients were followed up 14-27 months (mean, 22.3 months). Medial 
numbness and incision infection occurred in 2, 2 cases, respectively. The other 
patients had no obvious discomfort. At last follow-up, VAS score was 1.6±1.3 and 
AOFAS score was 90.6±2.7, showing significant differences when compared with 
preoperative ones ( t=8.18, P=0.00; t=-6.95, P=0.00). X-ray films showed that 
the talonavicular joint and calcaneus osteotomy achieved bony healing. The 
hindfoot axis on Saltzman view was (-2.5±2.7)°, CPA on lateral position was 
(25.0±5.2) °, Meary angle on lateral position was (2.6±2.1)°, T1MA on 
anteroposterior position was (8.1±3.8)°. There was no significant difference in 
Meary Angle between pre- and post-operation ( t=1.53, P=0.15). And there were 
significant differences in the hindfoot axis, CPA, and T1MA between pre- and 
post-operation ( t=11.93, P=0.00; t=-8.89, P=0.00; t=8.05, P=0.00).
CONCLUSION: For Müller-Weiss disease patients without adjacent joint arthritis, 
who are ineffective on conservative treatment, the satisfied short-term 
effectiveness can be obtained when treated by talonavicular joint arthrodesis 
and calcaneus osteotomy.

Background Musculoskeletal discomfort resulting from soft tissue injuries to 
muscles, bones, nerves, tendons, joints, or cartilage is referred to as 
musculoskeletal disorders. Neck pain is a common musculoskeletal condition with 
a significant socioeconomic impact on patients. Previous literature has linked 
the onset of neck pain to various factors, including psychological factors that 
may affect musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), similarly to physical factors. 
Psychological conditions, including anxiety and depression, may result in MSDs. 
Limited studies on the relationship between neck pain and psychological distress 
have been conducted among undergraduate students in Jeddah. The study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between neck pain and psychological distress. 
Additionally, the study examined the risk factors for developing neck pain, 
depression, and anxiety in King Abdulaziz University (KAU) undergraduate 
students. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted in November 2022 at 
KAU in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, by distributing a google forms survey among 
undergraduate university students in KAU, excluding graduate students and 
students who did not agree to participate. We received 509 responses; each 
respondent gave written consent and participated in the study. Result Neck pain 
prevalence was 50.7% of all students (95% CI, 46.3-55.1). Significantly higher 
neck pain scores were observed in women (p<0.001), in students who did little or 
no exercise, and in those who drank coffee more frequently >3 cups daily. 
Anxiety (p<0.001) and depression (p<0.001) scores were also positively and 
significantly correlated with neck pain scores. The results of the association 
analysis revealed that women had significant scores for anxiety (p<0.001) and 
depression (p<0.001). Female sex (p<0.001) and increased neck pain score 
(p<0.001) were independent risk factors for anxiety. Higher neck pain scores 
were also associated with depression (p<0.001). Conclusion Our study showed that 
anxiety and depression significantly impact neck pain. Furthermore, the 
increased score of depression and anxiety indicates worsening neck pain.

This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of mixed extracts of 
Achyranthes japonica Nakai (AJ) and Aralia continentalis Kitagawa (AC) (ratios 
of 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1) on RAW264.7 macrophages and evaluated the 
anti-inflammatory effects of the mixed extracts of AJ and AC by measuring IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNFα using the ELISA kit assay. In particular, the formation of nitric 
oxide (NO) was found to decrease in the group treated with the combined extracts 
of AJ and AC at all ratios. In particular, extracts of ratio of 2:1 (AJ:AC) 
deceased the formation of NO level that is approximately 60% of the group 
treated with only lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Also, extracts of ratio of 2:1 
(AJ:AC) reduced the production of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and PGE2 with statistical 
significance. Volunteers over the age of 50 who complain of discomfort in knee 
joints were selected as the experimental subjects. The subjects took daily 
administration of 2000 mg of the combined extracts of ratio of 2:1 (AJ:AC) for 
12 weeks. A survey (VAS (Visual Analog Scale), WOMAC (Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)) was conducted after the 12 weeks of 
oral administration. The experimental group showed the change between each visit 
and baseline time compared with the control group. In the intention-to-treat 
(ITT) analysis, VAS score and WOMAC stiffness score decreased significantly. And 
the WOMAC total score and function score tended to decrease. In the per-protocol 
(PP) analysis, the WOMAC stiffness score was significantly decreased and the VAS 
and WOMAC total and function scores were decreased. There was no significant 
difference in all parameters of ITT and PP in radiological examinations.

OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to identify the physical and mental state of 
women after delivery, to investigate the factors that influence those, and to 
examine the effects of postpartum care performance, which is traditionally 
believed to be appropriate care in Korea, on women's physical and mental status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 148 women who visited our hospital for 
postpartum check-up on the 2(nd) week or 6(th) week after delivery were 
selected. We researched postpartum care methods using a questionnaire and had 
the women self-evaluate their postpartum symptoms. Depression was evaluated 
using the Beck Depression Inventory.
RESULTS: The average points of the 27 postpartum symptoms was 2.70 points (from 
1 = very good to 5 = very bad). Seventy-two women had depression. Factors 
related to postpartum symptoms and depression were smoking before pregnancy, low 
marital satisfaction, bad mood during and after pregnancy, lack of support from 
husbands, and bad quality of sleep during puerperium. Treating the joints of 
hands carefully when milking breasts, and avoiding squatting down, demonstrated 
a negative correlation with the average points of postpartum symptoms. 
Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that mood during puerperium and 
Beck Depression Inventory points were significant factors related to the average 
points of postpartum symptoms and that the degree of support from husbands and 
mood during pregnancy were statistically related with depression.
CONCLUSION: Many women complained of postpartum discomfort. Although, while some 
postpartum care methods which are traditionally believed to be appropriate care 
in Korea can be helpful to women's recovery, most of them are not. We confirmed 
that physical symptoms and depression are closely related to each other.

BACKGROUND: Chest wall disease is a common disease in thoracic surgery. For most 
chest wall lesions, surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. 
Reconstruction is indicated for a wide range of chest wall defects. Currently, 
various reconstruction materials are used in clinic, including 3D printing 
materials and various types of metal materials. At present, most of the studies 
using titanium sternum-rib fixation system for reconstruction are case reports. 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the experience to discuss our essential 
surgical techniques for treating various types of chest wall reconstruction with 
a titanium sternum-rib fixation system over the last 5 years.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with chest 
wall tumors treated with a titanium sternum-rib fixation system in our center 
from 2016 to 2020. Chest wall reconstruction techniques, experiences, 
postoperative complications, and quality of life including chest discomfort, 
chronic pain, average time to return to normal life, chest wall deformity after 
resection for various types of chest wall tumors were analyzed. In this study, a 
total of 57 patients were successfully operated without chest wall deformity and 
return to daily life early. With an average of 2.3 ribs removed, including 10 
procedures involving sternotomy and reconstruction and 3 procedures involving 
sternoclavicular joint resection and reconstruction. The follow-up time of the 
whole group ranged from 3 months to 5 years. Postoperative chest discomfort 
occurred in 6 patients during follow-up; 2 patients had chronic pain. The 
average time to return to normal life was 1.4 months. One patient developed a 
deformed depression of the chest wall, and 2 patients developed wound 
infections. There was no perioperative death.
CONCLUSIONS: In our clinical experience, the titanium sternum-rib fixation 
system is safe, effective, and feasible. The technique is straightforward. The 
early and middle postoperative curative effect is satisfactory and can be used 
clinically.

INTRODUCTION: Severe hemophilia and subsequent hemophilic arthropathy result in 
joint pain and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Assessment of 
HRQoL in persons with hemophilia (PWH), including underlying factors that drive 
HRQoL differences, is important in determining health care resource allocation 
and in making individualized clinical decisions.
AIM: To examine potential associations between HRQoL, pain interference, and 
self-reported arthritis and age, employment, activity, bleed frequency, and 
hemophilia treatment center and health care professional utilization.
METHODS: PWH (age ≥18 years) from ten countries completed a 5-point Likert scale 
on pain interference over the previous 4 weeks, the EQ-5D-3L scale (mobility, 
usual activities, self-care, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) including a 
health-related visual analog scale (0-100, coded as an 11-point categorical 
response).
RESULTS: Pain interference (extreme/a lot) was higher in PWH aged >40 years 
(31%) compared to those aged 31-40 years (27%) or ≤30 years (21%). In an 
analysis of eight countries with home treatment, PWH who reported EQ-5D mobility 
issues were less likely to be employed (53% vs 79%, with no mobility issues). 
Median annual bleed frequency increased with worsening EQ-5D pain or discomfort. 
The percentage of PWH with inhibitors reporting visual analog scale scores of 
80-90-100 was lower (20%) than those without inhibitors (34%). Median bleed 
frequency increased with pain. Globally, nurse and social worker involvement 
increased with disability and pain; physiotherapist utilization was moderate 
regardless of the extent of disability or pain.
CONCLUSION: Increased disability and pain were associated with increased age, 
lower employment, higher reported bleed frequency, and lower HRQoL.

We present a unique case of intercostal muscle flap (ICMF) ossification 
mimicking an intrathoracic rib diagnosed 3 years after oesophageal perforation 
repair. A 58-year-old male presented with complaints of mild chest discomfort. 
Three years ago he had undergone left thoracotomy and primary repair of 
post-emetic oesophageal perforation. An ICMF had been used to strengthen the 
repair. Chest X-ray identified a linear calcific density within the left 
hemithorax. Subsequent thoracic CT characterized the anomaly as ossification of 
the ICMF. The lesion had the appearance of a well-differentiated intrathoracic 
rib coursing through the left lower lobe. We discuss the typical appearances of 
ossified ICMFs and the potential complications resulting from this ossification.

AIMS: A core outcome set for adult, open lower limb fracture has been 
established consisting of 'Walking, gait and mobility', 'Being able to return to 
life roles', 'Pain or discomfort', and 'Quality of life'. This study aims to 
identify which outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) should be recommended to 
measure each core outcome.
METHODS: A systematic review and quality assessment were conducted to identify 
existing instruments with evidence of good measurement properties in the open 
lower limb fracture population for each core outcome. Additionally, shortlisting 
criteria were developed to identify suitable instruments not validated in the 
target population. Candidate instruments were presented, discussed, and voted on 
at a consensus meeting of key stakeholders.
RESULTS: The Wales Lower Limb Trauma Recovery scale was identified, 
demonstrating validation evidence in the target population. In addition, ten 
candidate OMIs met the shortlisting criteria. Six patients, eight healthcare 
professionals, and 11 research methodologists attended the consensus meeting. 
Consensus was achieved for the EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-5L) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) to measure 'Quality 
of life' and 'Walking, gait and mobility' in future research trials, audit, and 
clinical assessment, respectively. No instrument met consensus criteria to 
measure 'Being able to return to life roles' and 'Pain or discomfort'. However, 
the EQ-5D-5L was found to demonstrate good face validity and could also be used 
pragmatically to measure these two outcomes, accepting limitations in 
sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: This study recommends the LEFS and EQ-5D-5L to measure the core 
outcome set for adult open lower limb fracture.

Choosing hypodontia treatment requires young people and parents to consider a 
large amount of information, identify what is important to them, and make 
trade-offs between options. This study aimed to examine young people and 
parents' preferences for hypodontia treatment using discrete choice experiment 
(DCE). This was a cross-sectional survey of young people (12-16 y) with 
hypodontia of any severity, at any stage of treatment, and their parents. 
Participants were recruited from NHS Hospitals in England and Wales. A bespoke 
DCE questionnaire was developed to measure preferences for 6 attributes of 
hypodontia treatment (waiting time, treatment time, problems during treatment, 
discomfort during treatment, bite, appearance). The questionnaire was completed 
1) online by young people and parents, individually or together, and 2) by 
child-parent dyads under observation. Preferences were analyzed using regression 
models. In total, 204 participants (122 young people, 56 parents, 26 dyads) 
completed the online questionnaire and 15 child-parent dyads completed the 
questionnaire under observation. The most important attribute in hypodontia 
treatment was improvement in appearance, but significant heterogeneity was found 
in preferences. Four distinct groups of participants were found: group 1 (39%): 
severe discomfort and problems were most important; group 2 (31%): most 
concerned about improvement in appearance of teeth and improvement in bite; 
group 3 (22%): appearance 3 times more important than any other attribute; and 
group 4 (9%): preferences difficult to interpret. There was variation in how 
child-parent dyads approached decision-making, with some negotiating joint 
preferences, while for others, one individual dominated. Making trade-offs in 
DCE tasks helped some people think about treatment and identify their 
preferences. Appearance is an important outcome from hypodontia treatment, but 
preferences vary and potential risks and functional outcome are also important 
to some people. There is a notable level of uncertainty in decision-making, 
which suggests further shared decision support would be valuable.

BACKGROUND: The typical American worker spends about two-thirds of their work 
day standing. Prolonged standing has been found to be associated with acute and 
chronic adverse health outcomes. There is considerable variability among 
existing methods of analysis for prolonged-standing data, and therefore 
difficulty interpreting and comparing results across studies.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop a bodyweight transfer analysis 
method that incorporates factors of both time and amplitude of loading. This 
method was then applied to actual prolonged-standing data, to understand how the 
results of this method are impacted by time spent standing, and how the results 
relate to previously-reported methods of analysis for weight shifting data.
METHODS: Seven subjects (six male, one female) stood with each foot on one of 
two force plates for 6 h with a 5-min seated rest break between hours. Our new 
method identified two different types of events: fidgets and weight shifts. 
Center-of-pressure data were analyzed with the proposed method and three 
existing methods of analysis.
RESULTS: Subjects utilized different quantities of fidgets and weight shifts 
over the course of the trials. Existing methods of analysis identified a wide 
range in number of events, with some methods consistently identifying more 
events than others. These existing methods significantly differed from the 
proposed method. Fidgets, weight shifts, and fidgets + weight shifts, as 
identified using the proposed method, had significant interactions with time, 
while only one of the existing methods showed a significant time interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions drawn from analysis of prolonged standing 
center-of-pressure data can differ significantly depending on the method of 
analysis used. The method proposed here accounts for the different sources of 
discomfort and the tissue characteristics of these sources. Future work should 
explore the relationships between physiologic parameters and fidgets and weight 
shifts, so that appropriate clinical interventions can be identified.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate a 6-month intervention with an olive leaf extract 
(OLE) on knee functionality and biomarkers of bone/cartilage metabolism and 
inflammation.
DESIGN: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centric trial 
included 124 subjects with knee pain or mobility issues. Subjects received twice 
a day one capsule of placebo or 125 mg OLE (Bonolive™, an OLE containing 50 mg 
of oleuropein) for 6 months. The co-primary endpoints were Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and serum Coll2-1NO2. The secondary 
endpoints were the subscales of the KOOS, knee pain VAS at rest and at walking, 
OARSI core set of performance-based tests and multiple inflammatory and bone or 
cartilage remodeling serum biomarkers and concentration of oleuropein's 
metabolites in urine.
RESULTS: At 6 months, OLE group was not efficient on global KOOS score, changes 
of inflammatory and cartilage remodeling biomarkers compared to placebo. Post 
hoc analyses demonstrated a large and significant treatment effect of OLE in a 
sub-group of subjects with high walking pain at baseline (p = 0.03). This was 
observed at 6 months for the global KOOS score, and each different subscale and 
for pain at walking (p = 0.02). OLE treatment was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: OLE was not effective on joint discomfort excepted in a sub-group of 
subjects with high pain at treatment initiation. As oleuropein is well 
tolerated, OLE can be used to relieve knee joint pain and enhance mobility in 
subjects with articular pain.

Muscle energy technique, commonly known as MET, is a form of manual therapy and 
stretching used in osteopathy. The patient actively contracts muscles in a 
precise direction while the therapist provides counterforce resistance. 
Isometric contractions relax and lengthen muscles. The technique is often 
regarded as direct, as the patient is placed toward the barrier.  In 1948, Fred 
Mitchell, Sr, DO, developed the technique after deducing the kinematic motions 
in the pelvis. From these concepts, he started to treat these somatic 
dysfunctions using muscle action as an activating force. Osteopathic physicians 
typically use MET to correct somatic dysfunction that causes pain and 
discomfort, especially when performing therapy on the thoracic spine. There 
are 9 physiologic principles to muscle energy: joint mobilization using muscle 
force, respiratory assistance, oculocephalic reflex, reciprocal inhibition, 
crossed extensor reflex, isokinetic strengthening, isolytic lengthening, muscle 
force in one region of the body to achieve movement in another and 
post-isometric relaxation. Out of these 9, post-isometric relaxation is the most 
commonly performed MET.  Dr Mitchell, Sr initially hypothesized that after an 
isometric contraction, the muscle is in a refractory state where it may be 
passively stretched without a reflexive contraction. MET with post-isometric 
relaxation involves putting increased tension on the muscle fibers by asking the 
patient to contract against a barrier; this activates the Golgi tendon fibers. 
Once activated, there is a reflexive inhibition and relaxation of the muscle 
through the Ia fibers, and the clinician may further passively stretch the 
muscle due to the refractory state.

Osteochondroma is the most common benign tumor of the growing bone commonly 
involving the knee joint region. It often involves the metaphysis of the long 
bone, occurring extra-articularly. In spite of this, solitary intra-articular 
osteochondroma has rarely been reported in the literature. A 41-year-old man 
presented with diffuse pain and discomfort of the left knee for over 2 months. 
Clinical examination revealed a bony prominence involving the superolateral 
aspect of the left distal femur. Diagnostic evaluation involved radiography, 
magnetic resonance imaging, and a diagnostic arthroscopy, which showed features 
of an intra-articular osteochondroma in the left distal femur. Arthroscopic 
excision of the solitary intra-articular osteochondroma resulted in a complete 
relief of symptoms and return to full competitive activities. No recurrence of 
symptoms occurred during the one year of follow-up. Solitary intra-articular 
osteochondroma of the knee is an unusual case, which can be successfully managed 
with arthroscopy.

INTRODUCTION: Epiphyseal separation of the distal humeral epiphysis is an 
extremely rare injury. Both clinical and radiological examinations are unclear 
and delayed diagnosis is reported. The absence of the ossification center of the 
capitellum complicates the radiological diagnosis and often it is reported as 
elbow dislocation.
CASE REPORT: We are reporting a case of a distal humeral epiphysis separation, 
diagnosed in the maternity hospital. The neonate had severe discomfort and 
reduced mobility of the affected arm. We confirmed the diagnosis with the 
conventional radiological examination, with the medial displacement of the 
olecranon and the articulation of the radius with the medial humeral condyle. We 
performed immediate reduction of the lesion and evaluated the restoration of the 
normal elbow anatomy with the correct articulation of the radius with the 
lateral humeral condyle. The neonate was followed for a year and there is normal 
development of the affected elbow.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of this rare neonatal fracture is essential to diagnose 
properly the lesion. Plain radiographic evaluation enabled us to diagnose the 
epiphysiolesthesis. We have treated our neonate with no invasive procedures and 
the final result was the normal development of the elbow joint.

Numerous investigations have documented active tuberculosis (TB) infection 
following biologic treatment. One of the most secure biologic medications for 
infections is secukinumab. Additionally, no cases of active TB while receiving 
secukinumab therapy were recorded. Secukinumab 150 mg per month has been 
administered for a 19-year-old man with spondyloarthritis since May 2020. A 
diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made when the patient complained of a moderate 
fever, a productive cough, and weight loss after 2 years. His fever and 
respiratory symptoms were relieved after 6 weeks of treatment by stopping 
secukinumab and utilizing 4 antibiotics: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, 
and ethambutol, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduced his joint 
and back discomfort. During biological therapy, even with secukinumab, annual 
screening for latent and active TB is crucial. We require additional study on 
secukinumab-treated patients with active TB in nations with high TB burdens, 
including Vietnam.

Musculoskeletal health is paramount in an ageing population susceptible to 
conditions such as osteoporosis, arthritis and fractures. Age-related changes in 
bone, muscle, and joint function result in declining musculoskeletal health, 
reduced mobility, increased risk of falls, and persistent discomfort. Preserving 
musculoskeletal wellbeing is essential for maintaining independence and 
enhancing the overall quality of life for the elderly. The global burden of 
musculoskeletal disorders is significant, impacting 1.71 billion individuals 
worldwide, with age-related muscle atrophy being a well-established phenomenon. 
Tocotrienols, a unique type of vitamin E found in various sources, demonstrate 
exceptional antioxidant capabilities compared to tocopherols. This 
characteristic positions them as promising candidates for addressing 
musculoskeletal challenges, particularly in mitigating inflammation and 
oxidative stress underlying musculoskeletal disorders. This review paper 
comprehensively examines existing research into the preventive and therapeutic 
potential of tocotrienols in addressing age-related musculoskeletal issues. It 
sheds light on the promising role of tocotrienols in enhancing musculoskeletal 
health and overall wellbeing, emphasizing their significance within the broader 
context of age-related health concerns.

Space is a complex and challenging setting encompassing the region beyond 
Earth's atmosphere where astronauts and spacecraft operate. The unique 
conditions of spaceflights, particularly microgravity and radiation, pose 
significant challenges to astronaut health, including the orofacial region. It 
has effects on saliva production, microbial composition, and oral hygiene 
practices, which influence oral health status, such as increased risk of dental 
caries, gum diseases, oral discomfort, temporomandibular joint dysfunctions, 
sialoliths, pain and dysesthesia in the teeth and oral mucosa, masticatory 
muscle atrophy, and oral cancer which can be detrimental during prolonged 
missions. Hence, a comprehensive approach to dental care in space is imperative 
to ensure astronauts' well-being and overall health as we strive to extend our 
presence beyond Earth. This literature review paper sheds light on the intricate 
effects of space on the orofacial region and delves into the unique challenges 
astronauts face in upholding optimal oral health while in space. It explores the 
current state of dentistry in space and discusses advancements and strategies 
that aim to maintain optimal oral health for astronauts during extended space 
missions.

Missed or chronic bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation is a rare 
presentation, usually secondary to epileptic attack. We present herein an 
exceptional case of this injury pattern, associated with bilateral displaced 
fracture of the coracoid process, and unilateral rupture of the long head of 
biceps. Treatment consisted of open reduction through osteotomy of the lesser 
tuberosity, with additional stabilization of the glenohumeral joint, using the 
Latarjet procedure by transposition of the coracoid fragment with its attached 
conjoint tendon to the antero-inferior glenoid rim. Rupture of the long head of 
the biceps required tenodesis. Temporary glenohumeral pin transfixation was 
performed for residual instability at the end of the procedure. Patients with 
postictal shoulder pain, discomfort, or disability should be investigated with 
adequate radiographs, in addition to CT scan or MRI when needed. Early diagnosis 
allows for safe closed reduction, and helps avoid late and more complex surgical 
treatment required for missed or chronic dislocations.

To assist hemiplegic patients with the activities of daily life, many upper limb 
soft exoskeletons have been developed. In this paper, we propose the structure 
of upper limb soft exoskeleton for rehabilitation training based on human 
biomechanics. The soft driving structure based on Bowden cable is devised. 
Man-machine interaction force must be considered because it can damage on the 
joint and lead to arm discomfort. We focus on structural optimization to 
minimize man-machine interaction force. Human arm model is established to 
perform motion simulation in ADAMS. To summarize optimality conditions, the 
movements of elbow are simulated in ADAMS when the number and location of force 
bearing points are changed. This paper describes the movement of the shoulder 
skeletal system through a mathematical model based on the Bowden cable 
transmission and utilizes man-machine contact force sensor to detect human 
interaction forces for analysis of experimental data. The experimental results 
show that man-machine interaction force can be reduced when the number of 
bearing force points is increased and bearing force point is away from the 
elbow.

Investigators from RAND Corporation and community treatment providers at 
Behavioral Health Services joined forces to test an intervention to improve 
services for patients with co-occurring mental disorders. In the course of 
working together, the partners confronted many of the issues that typify 
research-practice collaborations in community settings. The researchers' applied 
theoretical understanding and the counselors' intimacy with patient responses 
combined to strengthen the intervention. However, counselors' discomfort with 
some protocols and changes reflecting the extremely dynamic nature of the 
community-based research setting complicated the study execution and 
interpretation. Despite these challenges, the intervention improved the 
counselors' ability to identify and respond appropriately to patients' 
co-occurring disorders, and one of its components was associated with improved 
patient outcomes. The experience also demonstrated the advisability of 
consulting collaboratively with clinic staff during the planning of studies and 
the pretesting of study protocols.

INTRODUCTION: Painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are usually treated 
with physiotherapy, self-exercises, medication-based therapy and splint therapy. 
For splint therapy different types of splints are available. Therefore this 
randomized controlled study compared the effectiveness of a semi-finished 
occlusal appliance (SB) with a laboratory-made occlusal appliance (SS) in 
myofascial pain patients.
METHOD: The trial subjects allocated to the experimental groups with the (SB) 
occlusal appliance and those provided with a laboratory-made occlusal appliance 
(SS) did, in addition, receive conservative treatment (self-exercises, 
drug-based and manual therapy). The control group was given conservative therapy 
(CO) only. Overall, a total of 63 patients participated in the study with each 
group consisting of 21 subjects.
RESULTS: When the first follow-up examination took place (14 days after splint 
insertion) mouth opening within the SB group was significantly enlarged. When 
the second examination was conducted (2.5 months after splint insertion) mouth 
opening was significantly enlarged in both splint groups when compared with the 
initial value. In the control group, no significant enlargement of mouth opening 
was detected. At no point there was a significant reduction in the number of 
pressure-sensitive areas of the TMJ. On palpation of the masticatory muscles 
however, a significant reduction in the number of pressure-sensitive areas could 
be observed within the CO group and the SS group after 2.5 months. When 
comparing pain reduction (muscle/joint pain) and mouth opening, no significant 
differences could be detected between the treatments.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that TMD should be treated conservatively. In 
cases of restricted mouth opening, the additional use of occlusal appliances can 
eliminate the patient's discomfort more quickly. In this context, the tested, 
semi-finished occlusal appliance appears to offer an immediately available, 
temporary alternative to laboratory-made splints.

Anthropometric measurements to design best-fit femoral stem for the Indian 
population.

BACKGROUND: The standard commercially available marketed prostheses sometimes 
may not be the best fit to Indian patients because of the large anatomic 
variation. Orthopedic surgeons always stress the need for a proper 
implant-patient match in hip joint replacements, in particular, for a cementless 
femoral stem. The complications of mismatch are aseptic loosening, improper load 
distribution, and discomfort. The present study was undertaken to compare the 
differences in dimensions between femurs of elderly Indians and those of 
populations from other regions in order to solve the problem of a possible 
geometric mismatch between a selected implant and the hip joint as far as Indian 
patients are concerned.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements were made using computer aided design 
techniques on computed tomography (CT) scanned images of 98 femurs (56 left and 
42 right). The software used to convert the CT images into solid models was 
MIMICS(®) (Materialize, Inc., Leuven, Belgium). The geometrical parameters, 
viz., the femoral head offset, femoral head center (HC), femoral head diameter, 
femoral head relative position, position of shaft isthmus, neck-shaft angle, bow 
angle, femoral neck length, canal flare index, femoral length, and canal width 
at various locations, were chosen to design best-fit standard femoral stems for 
cementless insertion. These data were compared with the published data of other 
countries.
RESULTS: A difference of 16.8% was found in the femoral head offset between 
Indian and Swiss populations, which can affect soft tissue tension and range of 
motion. At a distance of 20 mm above the lesser trochanter (LT), the 
anteroposterior (AP) canal width was found to differ by 45.4%, when compared 
with a French population which can affect the mechanical stability of femoral 
stem. Femoral dimensions of Indian male and female subjects have also been 
compared and differences evaluated. At the LT, the aspect ratio (ratio of 
mediolateral canal width and AP canal width) in case of males (1.198) is 
approximately13% higher than that of females (1.059).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates a need for redesign of femoral stems. The 
obtained anthropometric femoral dimensions can be used to design and develop 
indigenous hip joint prosthesis in India. The results of this study can also be 
used in forensic anthropometric studies.

INTRODUCTION: Insufficient femoral head coverage is found in a variety of 
diseases, with acetabular dysplasia as the most frequent disorder and triple 
pelvic osteotomy as the most recently introduced surgical treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This study analyses pre- and postoperative pathoanatomic 
characteristics of triple in comparison to Salter and Chiari osteotomies, with a 
logistic regression analysis of outcome predictor and effect explanator factors 
in relation to the chosen type of operation.
METHODS: The study involved 136 adolescents treated with Salter and Chiari 
osteotomies or a triple pelvic osteotomy at the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgery 
"Banjica" in Belgrade. The patients were between 10-20 years old at the time of 
operation. We collected and analyzed data from all the patients: illness 
history, operative parameters, preoperative and postoperative pathoanatomic 
data. The data was statistically processed using the statistical software SPSS, 
defining standard descriptive values, and by using the appropriate tests of 
analytic statistics: t-test for dependent and independent variables, chi2-test, 
Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon's test, parameter correlation, one-way ANOVA, 
multi-factorial ANOVA and logistic regression, according to the type of the 
analyzed data and the conditions under which the statistical methods were 
applied.
RESULTS: The average CE angle after triple pelvic osteotomy was 43.5 degrees, 
more improved than after the Salter osteotomy (33.0 degrees) and Chiari 
osteotomy (31.4 degrees) (F = 16.822; p < 0.01). Postoperative spherical 
congruence was also more frequent after the triple osteotomy than after the 
other two types of operations, and with a high significance. Preoperative 
painful discomfort was found to be a valid predictor of indications for the 
triple osteotomy over both Chiari and Salter osteotomies. The valid explanators 
of effect for the triple osteotomy are: postoperative joint congruence (compared 
to the Chiari osteotomy) and increase in joint coverage (compared to Salter 
osteotomy).
CONCLUSION: Triple pelvic osteotomy is the method of choice in the management of 
acetabular dysplasia and other disturbances of hip joint containment in 
adolescent age.

BACKGROUND: Many people with tinnitus also suffer from hyperacusis. Both 
clinical and basic scientific data indicate an overlap in pathophysiologic 
mechanisms. In order to further elucidate the interplay between tinnitus and 
hyperacusis we compared clinical and demographic characteristics of tinnitus 
patients with and without hyperacusis by analyzing a large sample from an 
international tinnitus patient database.
MATERIALS: The default dataset import [November 1(st), 2012] from the Tinnitus 
Research Initiative [TRI] Database was used for analyses. Hyperacusis was 
defined by the question "Do sounds cause you pain or physical discomfort?" of 
the Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire. Patients who answered this 
question with "yes" were contrasted with "no"-responders with respect to 41 
variables.
RESULTS: 935 [55%] out of 1713 patients were characterized as hyperacusis 
patients. Hyperacusis in tinnitus was associated with younger age, higher 
tinnitus-related, mental and general distress; and higher rates of pain 
disorders and vertigo. In relation to objective audiological assessment patients 
with hyperacusis rated their subjective hearing function worse than those 
without hyperacusis. Similarly the tinnitus pitch was rated higher by 
hyperacusis patients in relation to the audiometrically determined tinnitus 
pitch. Among patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis the tinnitus was more 
frequently modulated by external noise and somatic maneuvers, i.e., exposure to 
environmental sounds and head and neck movements change the tinnitus percept.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the comorbidity of hyperacusis is a 
useful criterion for defining a sub-type of tinnitus which is characterized by 
greater need of treatment. The higher sensitivity to auditory, somatosensory and 
vestibular input confirms the notion of an overactivation of an unspecific 
hypervigilance network in tinnitus patients with hyperacusis.

The aim of the study was to explore peripheral blood gene expression as a source 
of biomarkers of joint health improvement related to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 
intake in humans. Healthy individuals with joint discomfort were enrolled in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study in humans. 
Subjects ate control yoghurt or yoghurt supplemented with a recently authorized 
novel food in Europe containing hyaluronic acid (65 %) from rooster comb 
(Mobilee™ as commercial name) for 90 days. Effects on functional quality-of-life 
parameters related to joint health were assessed. Whole-genome microarray 
analysis of peripheral blood samples from a subset of 20 subjects (10 placebo 
and 10 supplemented) collected pre- and post-intervention was performed. 
Mobilee™ supplementation reduced articular pain intensity and synovial effusion 
and improved knee muscular strength indicators as compared to placebo. About 157 
coding genes were differentially expressed in blood cells between supplemented 
and placebo groups post-intervention, but not pre-intervention (p < 0.05; fold 
change ≥1.2). Among them, a reduced gene expression of glucuronidase-beta 
(GUSB), matrix metallopeptidase 23B (MMP23B), xylosyltransferase II (XYLT2), and 
heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST1) was found in the supplemented 
group. Correlation analysis indicated a direct relationship between blood cell 
gene expression of MMP23B, involved in the breakdown of the extracellular 
matrix, and pain intensity, and an inverse relationship between blood cell gene 
expression of HS6ST1, responsible for 6-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate, and 
indicators of knee muscular strength. Expression levels of specific genes in 
blood cells, in particular genes related to GAG metabolism and extracellular 
matrix dynamics, are potential biomarkers of beneficial effects on articular 
health.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this protocol was to discover the connection between 
patients with non-surgical pain or other discomfort and their psychosocial 
status. Cognitive behavior therapy will be used, which we verified will 
determine the effect and feasibility of postoperative rehabilitation processes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study will include 200 patients ranging from 18 to 
60 years old who have underwent or will undergo FAI arthroscopy in the West 
China Hospital Sports Medicine Center from 2023 to 2026. A standardized 
prospective single-center parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be 
used for these participants. The participants will be divided into intervention 
(telephone versus face-to-face versus music versus floatation) and control 
groups. The follow-up periods will be measured pre-operatively, as well as 
postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcomes will include the 
modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) and the Visual Analogic Score (VAS), and the 
secondary outcomes will include the range of motion (ROM), the Huaxi 
Emotional-distress Index (HEI), and the depression, anxiety, and stress scale 
(DASS-21 scale). Furthermore, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and a 
Short-Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire will also be evaluated.
DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 
different types of psychosocial-therapy-based rehabilitation methods designed to 
improve the quality of life of FAI patients with persistent symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the effect of simultaneous application 
of arthrocentesis and occlusal splint.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 43 patients (3 males, 40 
females) whose symptoms had improved was conducted at the Department of Oral and 
Maxillofacial Surgery, Dong-A University Hospital between 2008 and 2010. 
Subjects were divided into three groups: Group A (17 patients with 
arthrocentesis and occlusal splints simultaneously applied), Group B (13 
patients whose symptoms did not improve with occlusal splints, undergoing 
arthrocentesis after occlusal splint use for 8 weeks), and Group C (13 patients 
that only used occlusal splints). We compared these groups in maximum 
comfortable opening (MCO) and the visual analogue scale of pain and noise. 
Follow-up was performed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.
RESULTS: The improvement of symptoms was noted in all three groups, but Group A 
had a quicker improvement than the other groups, in terms of pain reduction and 
MCO increases.
CONCLUSION: The simultaneous application of arthrocentesis and occlusal splints 
can reduce patient discomfort more quickly.

Early bone infarction was rarely reported, and additional research is needed for 
diagnosis and treatment. This article aims to report the diagnosis and treatment 
process of a patient with unexplained early bone infarction with soft-tissue 
abscess and a review of related literature. A 52-year-old male patient with 
early bone infarction of unknown etiology and soft-tissue abscess was analyzed 
retrospectively. He sustained right thigh swelling and pain for 5 days and hip 
and knee joint dysfunction, accompanied by fever, temperature 38°C, no limb 
numbness, sensory disturbance, and other discomfort. On MR images, early bone 
infarction with local soft-tissue abscess was found. After incision and drainage 
of soft-tissue abscess, wound débridement, and suture, the swelling and pain of 
the affected limb dysfunction gradually recovered. Early bone infarction of 
unknown etiology with soft-tissue abscess has a low incidence. MRI is the main 
imaging diagnostic method. Conservative treatment is the main guard against 
malignant changes and surgical treatment, if necessary.

BACKGROUND: There are very few studies of the association between 
temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) and oral health-related quality of life 
(OHRQoL) in a representative sample from the Asia-Pacific region. Accordingly, 
we aimed to quantify the association of TMD with OHRQoL dimensions and overall 
measurement scores in a representative sample of Australian adults while 
accounting for a range of confounders, and statistically estimating whether TMD 
experience is meaningfully associated with OHRQoL.
METHOD: Australia's National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004-2006 data were 
used. The outcome variables were the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) 
domains and overall scores while the main exposure was self-reported Diagnostic 
Criteria Question for TMD. The analysis accounted for confounders including oral 
health status obtained from the oral examination, demographics, socioeconomics, 
health behaviours and health including perceived stress subscales of the PSS-14. 
We conducted complex samples analysis while using Cohen's f2 effect size to 
estimate whether the association is meaningful.
RESULTS: TMD prevalence was 9.9% (95% CI: 8.4-11.6%) among 4133 Australian 
adults. TMD experience was associated with impairments to the seven OHIP-14 
OHRQoL domains (P < .05) with higher impairments observed in physical pain 
(B = 0.82, 95% CI: .45-1.20, P < .001), psychological discomfort (B = 0.68, 95% 
CI: .29-1.06, P = .001) and psychological disability (B = 0.52, 95% CI: .20-.84, 
P = .001) in adjusted multivariate analyses. The difference in the mean OHIP-14 
scores for those reporting TMD (Mean = 13.1, 95% CI: 12.0-14.0) and those who 
did not (Mean = 6.6, 95% CI: 6.0-6.8) was significant (t = 7.51, P < .001). In 
an adjusted multivariable model for OHIP-14 scores, TMD experience was 
associated with higher OHIP-14 scores (B = 3.34, 95% CI: 1.94-4.75, P < .001) 
where the Cohen's f2 was .022. Further, perceived stress subscales: perceived 
distress and perceived control were associated with TMD experience and OHIP-14 
scores (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Lower OHRQoL was observed in Australian adults who reported TMD 
experience but with small clinical importance which might support considering 
TMD in regular dental care. The higher impairments observed in physical pain, 
psychological discomfort and psychological disability domains of OHRQL can help 
clinicians and researchers focus their attention on these domains. The 
confounding effect exhibited by the perceived stress subscale might support 
their inclusion in future TMD and OHRQoL research.

BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses have advised against distal clavicle resection 
(DCR) as an adjuvant procedure during rotator cuff repair (RCR), whether 
performed routinely or in shoulders diagnosed with symptomatic acromioclavicular 
joint (ACJ) arthropathy. However, the efficacy of DCR as a secondary procedure 
in patients with persistent pain attributed to symptomatic ACJ arthropathy 
remains unknown.
PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes of secondary DCR in patients with failed 
nonoperative treatment of symptomatic ACJ arthropathy after isolated RCR with 
complete tendon healing.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2018, the senior surgeon performed isolated RCR in 
1935 patients, of which 23 (1.2%) presented with ACJ pain and discomfort at ≥12 
months after the index RCR, despite complete healing of repaired tendons. Those 
23 patients underwent secondary DCR, as ACJ arthropathy was confirmed clinically 
and radiographically. Clinical assessment before DCR included the Subjective 
Shoulder Value (SSV) and pain at rest. Clinical assessment at >12 months after 
DCR included the SSV, pain at rest, Constant-Murley score, range of motion, and 
satisfaction. Pre- and post-DCR SSV and pain scores were compared.
RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 5 patients did not consent to the use of their 
data, leaving 18 patients aged 53.3 ± 7.6 years (mean ± SD; range, 39-68 years) 
for outcome assessment. At a mean follow-up of 7.0 ± 3.1 years after DCR, the 
SSV significantly improved from 58.7 ± 17.2 to 76.1 ± 20.2 (P < .001), and the 
pain at rest significantly decreased from 4.7 ± 1.5 to 2.8 ± 1.9 (P < .001). At 
final follow-up, the Constant-Murley score was 70.2 ± 21.0. Of 18 patients, 15 
had none or mild residual pain (0-2; 83%), while 3 had substantial residual pain 
(5 or 6; 17%). Only 1 of the 3 patients with substantial residual pain had a 
poor SSV score (20 points) and was against opting for DCR in retrospect. No 
patient had infections or gross ACJ instability after DCR.
CONCLUSION: Secondary DCR for cases of symptomatic ACJ arthropathy after 
isolated RCR with complete tendon healing reduced pain in 83% of patients, and 
94% were satisfied and would undergo secondary DCR again.

BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is a common condition affecting both adults and 
children. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, 
sneezing and nasal itching, which may affect their quality of life.Nasal 
irrigation with saline (salty water), also known as nasal douching, washing or 
lavage, is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with isotonic or hypertonic 
saline solutions. It can be performed with low positive pressure from a spray, 
pump or squirt bottle, with a nebuliser or with gravity-based pressure in which 
the person instils saline into one nostril and allows it to drain out of the 
other. Saline solutions are available over the counter and can be used alone or 
as an adjunct to other therapies.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of nasal saline irrigation in people with 
allergic rhinitis.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials 
Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; 
ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished 
trials. The date of the search was 23 November 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal saline 
irrigation, delivered by any means and with any volume, tonicity and alkalinity, 
with (a) no nasal saline irrigation or (b) other pharmacological treatments in 
adults and children with allergic rhinitis. We included studies comparing nasal 
saline versus no saline, where all participants also received pharmacological 
treatment (intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures 
expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity 
and a common adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were 
disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), individual symptom 
scores, general HRQL, the adverse effects of local irritation or discomfort, ear 
symptoms (pain or pressure) and nasal endoscopy scores. We used GRADE to assess 
the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies (747 participants). The studies included 
children (seven studies, 499 participants) and adults (seven studies, 248 
participants). No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. 
Saline volumes ranged from 'very low' to 'high' volume. Where stated, studies 
used either hypertonic or isotonic saline solution.Nasal saline versus no saline 
treatmentAll seven studies (112 adults; 332 children) evaluating this comparison 
used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we 
pooled the data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Saline irrigation 
may improve patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline at up to 
four weeks (SMD -1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.84 to -0.81; 407 
participants; 6 studies; low quality) and between four weeks and three months 
(SMD -1.44, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.48; 167 participants; 5 studies; low quality). 
Although the evidence was low quality the SMD values at both time points are 
considered large effect sizes. Subgroup analysis showed the improvement in both 
adults and children. Subgroup analyses for volume and tonicity were inconclusive 
due to heterogeneity.Two studies reported methods for recording adverse effects 
and five studies mentioned them. Two studies (240 children) reported no adverse 
effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group and three only reported 
no adverse effects in the saline group.One study (48 children) reported 
disease-specific HRQL using a modified RCQ-36 scale. It was uncertain whether 
there was a difference between the groups at any of the specified time points 
(very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported.Nasal saline 
versus no saline with adjuvant use of intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines 
Three studies (40 adults; 79 children) compared saline with intranasal steroids 
versus intranasal steroids alone; one study (14 adults) compared saline with 
oral antihistamines versus oral antihistamines alone. It is uncertain if there 
is a difference in patient-reported disease severity at up to four weeks (SMD 
-0.60, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.15; 32 participants; 2 studies; very low quality) or 
from four weeks to three months (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.85 to 0.21; 58 
participants; 2 studies; very low quality). Although none of the studies 
reported methods for recording adverse effects, three mentioned them: one study 
(40 adults; adjuvant intranasal steroids) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis 
or local discomfort) in either group; the other two only reported no adverse 
effects in the saline group.It is uncertain if saline irrigation in addition to 
pharmacological treatment improved disease-specific HRQL at four weeks to three 
months, compared with pharmacological treatment alone (SMD -1.26, 95% CI -2.47 
to -0.05; 54 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). No other secondary 
outcomes were reported.Nasal saline versus intranasal steroidsIt is uncertain if 
there was a difference in patient-reported disease severity between nasal saline 
and intranasal steroids at up to four weeks (MD 1.06, 95% CI -1.65 to 3.77; 14 
participants; 1 study), or between four weeks and three months (SMD 1.26, 95% CI 
-0.92 to 3.43; 97 participants; 3 studies), or indisease-specific HRQL between 
four weeks and three months (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.75; 83 participants; 2 
studies). Only one study reported methods for recording adverse effects although 
three studies mentioned them. One (21 participants) reported two withdrawals due 
to adverse effects but did not describe these or state which group. Three 
studies reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) with saline, 
although one study reported that 27% of participants experienced local 
discomfort with steroid use. No other secondary outcomes were reported.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Saline irrigation may reduce patient-reported disease 
severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to three months in both adults 
and children with allergic rhinitis, with no reported adverse effects. No data 
were available for any outcomes beyond three months. The overall quality of 
evidence was low or very low. The included studies were generally small and used 
a range of different outcome measures to report disease severity scores, with 
unclear validation. This review did not include direct comparisons of saline 
types (e.g. different volume, tonicity).Since saline irrigation could provide a 
cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines 
further high-quality, adequately powered research in this area is warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Few studies have quantified the prevalence of weight-related 
orthopedic conditions in otherwise healthy overweight children. The goal of the 
present investigation was to describe the musculoskeletal consequences of 
pediatric overweight in a large pediatric cohort of children that included 
severely overweight children.
METHODS: Medical charts from 227 overweight and 128 nonoverweight children and 
adolescents who were enrolled in pediatric clinical studies at the National 
Institutes of Health from 1996 to 2004 were reviewed to record pertinent 
orthopedic medical history and musculoskeletal complaints. Questionnaire data 
from 183 enrollees (146 overweight) documented difficulties with mobility. In 
250, lower extremity alignment was determined by bilateral 
metaphyseal-diaphyseal and anatomic tibiofemoral angle measurements made from 
whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans.
RESULTS: Compared with nonoverweight children, overweight children reported a 
greater prevalence of fractures and musculoskeletal discomfort. The most common 
self-reported joint complaint among those who were questioned directly was knee 
pain (21.4% overweight vs 16.7% nonoverweight). Overweight children reported 
greater impairment in mobility than did nonoverweight children (mobility score: 
17.0 +/- 6.8 vs 11.6 +/- 2.8). Both metaphyseal-diaphyseal and anatomic 
tibiofemoral angle measurements showed greater malalignment in overweight 
compared with nonoverweight children.
CONCLUSIONS: Reported fractures, musculoskeletal discomfort, impaired mobility, 
and lower extremity malalignment are more prevalent in overweight than 
nonoverweight children and adolescents. Because they affect the likelihood that 
children will engage in physical activity, orthopedic difficulties may be part 
of the cycle that perpetuates the accumulation of excess weight in children.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that causes 
discomfort, synovial membrane inflammation, peripheral joint inflammation, 
morning stiffness, articular tissue loss, and restricted joint movement. In the 
present study, we aim to explore the anti-arthritic efficacy of Bombax ceiba 
ethanolic extract in a Freund's Complete Adjuvant-induced arthritis, in murine 
model. The hot soxhlet method was used to extract dried aerial components of 
Bombax ceiba using an ethyl alcohol: water (70:30) ratio. Bombax ceiba ethanolic 
extract at two doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg was investigated in Wistar rats 
against Freund's full adjuvant-induced chronic immunological arthritis. 
Anti-arthritis efficacy was studied utilising morphological research (paw 
volume, paw diameter, and body weight). On the 28th day, the animals were 
sacrificed, and haematological parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(TNF-alpha, IL-6), cell culture, histological and radiological analysis were 
performed. BCEE inhibited paw oedema significantly (P 0.05) at a dose of 
40mg/Kg, which was corroborated by paw volume and diameter, as well as 
haematological parameters, in Freund's complete adjuvant-induced arthritis 
model. The BCEE also significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and 
the histopathological changes caused by Freund's full adjuvant model. BCEE 
preserves synovial membranes by enhancing health and has shown a significant 
anti-arthritic activity. Thus, data confirms the traditional usage of Bombax 
ceiba for arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the protective effects of 
Phellinus linteus mycelium (PLM) and its possible mechanisms in a model of 
monosodium iodoacetate- (MIA-) induced osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: Intra-articular injection of MIA was injected to 50 μL with 80 mg/mL 
using a 0.3 mL insulin syringe into the right knee joint. Changes in hindpaw 
weight-bearing distribution between the right (osteoarthritic) and left 
(contralateral control) legs were used as an index of joint discomfort. PLM (50, 
100, and 200 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered once daily for 14 days 
from day 7 after MIA treatment. And then, various factors associated with 
inflammatory response and cartilage degeneration in cartilage tissues detected 
by western blotting.
RESULTS: PLM treatment showed a concentration-dependent elevation in change in 
hindpaw weight-bearing distribution (HWBD). PLM200 demonstrated the capacity to 
significantly increase HWBD, indicating that the change in weight-bearing 
distribution means the reduction of spontaneous pain. Our results indicate that 
PLM suppressed the inflammatory factors via NF-κB signaling pathway induced by 
p38 phosporlyation. Moreover, PLM200 exhibited a significant reduction of ROS 
produced by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. 
PLM100 and PLM200 inhibited the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, one 
of proteinase that degrades extracellular matrix (ECM).
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicated that PLM has a strong 
chondroprotective effect through the suppression both ROS production and 
inflammation.

Increased pain and/or discomfort during chewing, speaking, and swallowing have 
been commonly reported by patients with Temporomandibular Dysfunction (TMD). 
Speech-language pathology therapy (orofacial myofunctional therapy - OMT) has 
been proposed as part of the treatment for this condition; however, it is a 
modality that should be introduced when the TMD context and the pain are not 
accentuated, so that they do not prevent or hinder the performance of exercises. 
The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of OMT on the treatment of 
patients with TMD, according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for 
Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD), after analgesia with low-level laser 
therapy (LLLT), regarding orofacial myofunctional conditions (OMC) and the 
perception of TMD symptoms. Five patients aged 50 to 61 years were evaluated 30 
days after completion of LLLT. An experienced speech-language pathologist 
conducted, pre- and post-OMT, the application of the ProDTM Multi-questionnaire 
- to investigate the self-perception of TMD symptomatology, and the Orofacial 
Myofunctional Evaluation with Scores (OMES) clinical examination - to confirm 
the orofacial myofunctional conditions. OMC presented increased OMT scores, 
indicating an increase in myofunctional orofacial balance. According to the 
patients' perception, TMD signs and symptoms were relieved after the application 
of OMT. According to the self-perception of the treated patients, introduction 
of OMT after LLLT analgesia promoted a balance of the orofacial functions of the 
sample studied, as well as a decrease in the remaining TMD signs and symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Chikungunya fever is considered an abrupt onset arbovirus 
transmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The 
disease has a significant impact on the quality of life of affected persons, and 
many of its numerous symptoms have not yet been properly clarified, such as the 
manifestations that can occur in the oral cavity. The aim of this study was to 
identify the main oral manifestations related to chikungunya fever, as well as 
describe the demographic characteristics of patients, by conducting a systematic 
review of the literature.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Searches were performed in MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase 
(Elsevier), LILACS (VHL), Cochrane Library, Scopus, and CAPES electronic 
databases for theses and dissertations published up to January 16, 2021 without 
language and date restrictions. Additional manual searches of gray literature, 
reference list, and Google Scholar were carried out. We included 27 studies 
highlighting mainly oral manifestations that cause masticatory discomfort such 
as ulcers and oral thrush, gingival bleeding, pain and burning of the oral 
mucous membranes, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia, opportunistic 
infections, and changes in taste.
CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a predominance of oral manifestations that cause 
discomfort when chewing, such as ulcerations in the acute phase of the disease, 
with complete remission within 3 to 10 days after the onset, apparently mostly 
affecting women and older persons. These oral manifestations can be compatible 
with basic viral infections related to inflammatory response and transitory 
immunosuppression.

(1) Objective: Greenhouse workers are considered a special occupational group 
who are exposed to more toxic and harmful substances than ordinary farmers. The 
health problem of this group is a public health problem that warrants attention. 
Taking greenhouse workers in Ningxia, China, as the research sample, this study 
analyzed the health risk to practitioners posed by the greenhouse working 
environment. (2) Method: To analyze the relationship between pesticide exposure 
and the health of greenhouse workers, the genetic matching method was used to 
exclude the influence of covariates on the results. (3) Results: The results 
showed a statistical significance regarding the prevalence of cardiovascular 
diseases (CVD), skeletal muscle system diseases (SMSD) and digestive diseases 
between the different exposure groups. Researching the disease symptoms found 
that different levels of exposure to pesticides in greenhouses could cause 
multisystem and multisymptom discomfort. In addition to some irritant symptoms 
such as eye itching, itching, and sneezing, there were also differences in terms 
of the frequency of discomfort such as back pain, a decline in sleep quality, 
memory loss, joint pain, swelling and weakness, upper abdominal pain and 
flatulence, in the different exposure groups. (4) Conclusion: Different levels 
of exposure to pesticides in greenhouses may be one of the risk factors for 
practitioners to suffer from various systemic diseases, affecting their health 
and work efficiency. This hazard is manifested not only in some acute irritant 
symptoms but also in chronic diseases due to long-term exposure.

PURPOSE: To explore the technique of surgical treatment of hand and foot gout 
stone by using 3D CT reconstruction images and influence factors on prognosis.
METHOD: 48 cases of hand and foot gout were treated surgically and retrospective 
analyzed. Before operation, we used 3D CT reconstruction images to check the 
accurate site and amount of uric acid (white chalk foam) deposition. Different 
surgical methods were applied depending on the different deposition site of 
urine acid stone. The frequency of gout attack and blood uric acid was compared 
before and after surgery. Patients were followed up to observe the recovery and 
recurrence and then analyzed the reason of unsuccessful healing.
RESULT: Sutures were removed 2 weeks after operation in all cases. The frequency 
of gout attack and blood uric acid of patients 3 months after operation was 
lower than those before operation, and the differences were statistically 
significant. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 3 years, with an average of 1.8 years. 
Three cases were not followed up. The remaining 45 cases were healed in the 
first stage. 40 cases had improved joint function, increased range of motion, 
and relieved discomfort after movement. 5 cases had no improvement in joint 
function after operation, and 3 of them had gout stone recurrence (nonoperative 
area) and were treated by second hospital operation.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of gout stone in hand and foot under the guidance 
of three-dimensional CT reconstruction image can effectively alleviate the local 
symptoms of gout stone and improve the function of hand and foot. Deep tissue 
can be thoroughly washed by the pressure of pulse gun after resection of the 
lesion, which can reduce the incidence of gout stone. Malnutrition, 
hypoproteinemia, and residual urine acid in the wound are the main reasons for 
unsuccessful healing.

BACKGROUND: Various types of miniplates have been developed and used for the 
reduction of facial bone fractures. We introduced Yang's Keyhole (YK) plate, and 
reported on its short-term stability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
the long-term stability of the YK plate, as a follow-up study, by examining the 
patients who had used the YK plate among the patients with the reduction of 
mandible fractures and who visited for plate removal.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 16 patients who underwent mandibular 
fracture fixation using a YK plate (group I) and 17 patients who underwent 
mandibular fracture fixation using a conventional plate (group II). Assessment 
was then made on malunion, occlusal stability, discomfort during the 
application, and clinical symptoms.
RESULTS: From January 2015 to December 2017, a total of 36 patients underwent 
mandibular fracture surgery using a YK plate. A total of 16 patients received 
plate removal. Among them, 15 were male and 1 female. The average age was 26 
years. The applied surgical sites were the 12 on mandibular angle, 4 on 
mandibular symphysis, and 2 on subcondyle. The application period of YK plate 
was an average of 335 days. During the same period, 45 people underwent surgery 
on the conventional plate. A total of 17 patients received plate removal. Among 
them, 15 were male and 2 females. The average age was 36 years. The applied 
surgical sites were the 8 on mandibular angle, 4 on mandibular symphysis, and 2 
on subcondyle. The application period of the conventional plate was an average 
of 349 days. No malocclusion occurred at the time of removal, and occlusion was 
stable. No patient complained of joint disease or discomfort.
CONCLUSION: The YK plate system, in which the screw was first inserted and the 
plate was applied, for clinical convenience did not cause any particular problem 
and no significant difference from the conventional plate.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), recognized as the most common conditions of 
chronic orofacial pain, have a multifactorial etiology. Acupuncture can help to 
relieve the pain and discomfort associated with these conditions, because it can 
rebalance the energy (Qi) circulating in the meridians. The aim of the study was 
to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating the pain; mouth opening 
limitation, and energy circulating in the meridians of patients with TMD of 
muscular or mixed origin. This was a controlled, randomized, double-blind 
clinical trial conducted at the Piracicaba Dental School (FOP/Unicamp), in 
Piracicaba SP, Brazil. The Treatment Group received acupuncture with real 
penetration of the needle, and the Placebo Group received a sham treatment 
without needle penetration. The acupoints used were: ST6, ST7, SI18, GV20, GB20, 
BL10, and LI4, during treatment performed for four weekly sessions. The TMD and 
mouth opening were evaluated according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for 
Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC). The measurements of the energy at the 
meridians were performed by the Ryodoraku method, before and after acupuncture 
in all of the sessions in both groups. The results showed no decrease in pain in 
the Treatment Group when compared with the Placebo Group (p = 0.2261). There was 
no increase in the oral opening limit in the Treatment Group compared with the 
Placebo Group (p > 0.05). Regarding the energy levels, after acupuncture, there 
was a decrease in Yang energy in all sessions (p < 0.05), in both groups, 
however, only real acupuncture was effective in maintaining the Yin energy 
average throughout the four sessions, with significant difference between groups 
(p = 0.0198). In conclusion, volunteers with TMD presented a pattern of energy 
deficiency and the most prevalent imbalance patterns identified were in the 
meridians coupled to the kidney and bladder, and in the Shao Yin (heart/kidney) 
and Shao Yang (triple energizer/gall bladder) energetic planes. The acupuncture 
points used were equally effective in reducing pain in both groups; increasing 
the unassisted mouth opening limitation without pain in the Treatment Group, and 
were also effective in preserving the Yin energy in the Treatment Group. The 
Yang energy decreased equally in both groups.

Introduction: Many employees report high physical strain from overhead work and 
resulting musculoskeletal disorders. The consequences of these conditions extend 
far beyond everyday working life and can severely limit the quality of life of 
those affected. One solution to this problem may be the use of upper-limb 
exoskeletons, which are supposed to relieve the shoulder joint in particular. 
The aim of this literature review was to provide an overview of the use and 
efficacy of exoskeletons for upper extremities in the working environment. 
Methods: A literature review was conducted using the PICO scheme and the PRISMA 
statement. To this end, a systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Web of 
Science and Scopus databases in May 2020 and updated in February 2022. The 
obtained studies were screened using previously defined inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and assessed for quality. Pertinent data were then extracted from the 
publications and analyzed with regard to type of exoskeleton used as well as 
efficacy of exoskeleton use. Results: 35 suitable studies were included in the 
review. 18 different exoskeletons were examined. The majority of the 
exoskeletons only supported the shoulder joint and were used to assist 
individuals working at or above shoulder level. The main focus of the studies 
was the reduction of muscle activity in the shoulder area. Indeed, 16 studies 
showed a reduced activity in the deltoid and trapezius muscles after exoskeleton 
use. Kinematically, a deviation of the movement behavior could be determined in 
some models. In addition, study participants reported perceived reduction in 
exertion and discomfort. Discussion: Exoskeletons for upper extremities may 
generate significant relief for the intended tasks, but the effects in the field 
(i.e., working environment) are less pronounced than in the laboratory setting. 
This may be due to the fact that not only overhead tasks but also secondary 
tasks have to be performed in the field. In addition, currently available 
exoskeletons do not seem to be suitable for all overhead workplaces and should 
always be assessed in the human-workplace context. Further studies in various 
settings are required that should also include more females and older people.

The autologous lipoaspirate processing allows to obtain a tissue product to be 
transplanted for regenerative purposes in multiple pathological sites, such as 
the knee joint affected by osteoarthritic disease. Recently, multiple protocols 
and devices have been designed for lipoaspirate processing. These protocols and 
devices do not use enzymatic digestion and respect the principles of the 
so-called "minimal manipulation in a closed system". In this study, we performed 
a systematic review of the literature to identify studies in which 
osteoarthritis was treated by minimally manipulated intra-articular SVF 
injection and assessment of therapeutic response was reported. All bias scores 
were analyzed based on the Coleman methodology score modified by Kon et al. [27] 
and a subsequent linear classification system of articles was proposed. We 
identified 12 clinical trials in which clinical evaluations were performed 
inconsistently using different scales of analysis. All studies reported a 
significant decrease in the patient's symptomatic discomfort, with improvement 
in joint function and reduction in pain. Most studies do not reach a 
high-quality level on the linear scale based on the Coleman-Kon scores. Although 
the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee with regenerative methods is 
undoubtedly of interest, being aimed at healing the disease, this study 
highlights that the trials are numerically limited, and qualitatively not 
optimal according to the Coleman-Kon score. Reasonably, greater standardization 
of devices protocols will be desirable in the future. The high clinical 
potential offered by these methods could be optimized for all patients.

BACKGROUND: A Galeazzi fracture is defined as a fracture of the radius 
associated with dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ). The 
conventional surgical technique of nailing does not give enough stability and 
open reduction, internal fixation with the plate is associated with numerous 
complications. The stacked nailing for the management of these injuries provides 
adequate stability, maintains the relationship of the DRUJ and promotes 
uneventful union by closed technique. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
the results of simple, user-friendly, low cost elastic stacked nailing for the 
management of Galeazzi fracture dislocation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated 22 young adults with fresh Galeazzi 
fracture-dislocation of the forearm, from January 2004 to January 2008, by 
percutaneous fixation of fracture by stacked elastic nailing at our institute. 
There were 19 males and three females and the age group ranged from 20-56 years 
(average 35 years). Surgery was performed within 48 to 72 hours under the 
guidance of image intensifier. Medullary cavity was filled with two elastic 
titanium nails having unequal lengths and diameter. One nail acts as a reduction 
nail and the other acts as a stabilizing nail. The results were evaluated using 
Mikic criteria based on union, alignment, relationship of the DRUJ, and 
movements at the inferior radio ulnar joint, elbow and wrist.
RESULTS: In six cases, following radiological union, nails in the radius were 
extracted between six to nine months after operation because of discomfort 
complained by the patient at site of insertion. After one year follow-up, 18 
patients had excellent, four had fair results.
CONCLUSION: Closed reduction and internal fixation of Galeazzi fracture by two 
elastic rods re-establishes the normal relationship of the fractured fragments 
and the DRUJ without repair of the ligaments. The stability is achieved by the 
flexibility and elasticity of the nails, crowding of the medullary canal and 
anchorage they gain in the radial diaphysis. Elastic nailing can produce 
excellent clinical results for Galeazzi fracture-dislocation. It has the 
advantages of technical simplicity, minimal cost, user-friendly instrumentation, 
and a short learning curve.

Research and Practice Center, Alanya, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The localized form is characterized by local participation of the 
synovium as a nodule or pedunculated mass. The incidence rate of PVNS is 
estimated to be 1.8 per million people - the localized type is just one-quarter 
of that. The aim of this study is to remind orthopedic surgeons about the 
unusual properties of LPVNS located in the knee.
CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old man presented to our clinic with pain and discomfort 
in his right knee. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intra-articular mass in 
the infrapatellar region of the knee adjacent to the Hoffa fat pad. The mass was 
hypointense in the T1 sequence and heterogeneously hyperintense in the T2 
sequence, which may be considered a local type of tenosynovial giant cell tumor 
(LPVNS). Excision was carefully performed without penetrating the tumor. The 
macroscopic appearance of the tumor was yellow-reddish and brown in color. 
Histopathologic examination revealed pigmented villonodular synovitis of the 
local type.
CONCLUSION: Even though the LPVNS of the knee is an uncommon intra-articular 
phenomenon, orthopedic surgeons should not overlook this lesion based on imaging 
findings, and open excision should be regarded as a reliable treatment option.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a usual disorder depicted as discomfort and loss of 
functional performance, including decreased proprioceptive acuity. Symptoms of 
this condition include stiffness, pain, swelling, joint disproportion, 
functional incompetency, and muscle atrophy, which may reduce the well-being of 
the patient. This report highlights the case of a 41-year-old female patient who 
complained of right knee pain, which was persisting for a month, and was treated 
with the McKenzie Technique (MT) along with electrotherapy modalities. 
Following 12 days protocol, there was a substantial reduction in pain, 
improvement in functional ability and knee muscle strength, and reduced walking 
time. Various other physiotherapy approaches and techniques were inculcated in 
the management of OA, which involved a soft tissue approach, therapeutic 
training, and manual method. Hence, this case report highlights the pragmatic 
effect of lower limb MT in grade 1 knee OA patients, which may improve the 
patient's well-being.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The prevalent cause of shoulder pain is rotator cuff tears 
(RCT), which induce profound discomfort and morbidity. Hence, their detection 
and appropriate management become important to alleviate morbidity and enhance 
quality of life. Imaging has an important role in the diagnosis of such patients 
to guide for further management. A wide array of radiological approaches has 
been explored for the detection of RCT. The study aimed to assess the 
sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) of regular magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) in the diagnosis and characterization of RCT and furthermore to link the 
results of MRI with the arthroscopy findings. The limitations and pitfalls if 
any with MRI patients presenting were also addressed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a diagnostic evaluation study conducted at 
the Department of Radiodiagnosis, Muslim Educational Society (MES) Medical 
College, Perinthalmanna, India, among individuals with RCT between December 1, 
2015, and May 31, 2017. Patients who were referred for MRI and then taken up for 
arthroscopy were included. The findings for each tendon of rotator cuff on MRI 
were contrasted with that of arthroscopy, and the percentage of agreement was 
calculated. Additional findings relevant to the study were also noted. SN, SP, 
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI were 
determined by taking arthroscopic findings as the gold standard.
RESULTS: The study was comprised of 36 patients assessed using MRI and 
arthroscopy for RCT. The study participants ranged in age from 31 to 70 years, 
with a mean of 52.69±8.86 years. The majority of the patients (69.4%) were 
between the ages of 41 and 60 years. MRI had 100% SN and SP for full-thickness 
supraspinatus (SS) tear, 50% SN and 100% SP for partial-thickness SS tear, 100% 
SN and 80% SP for full-thickness infraspinatus (IS) tear, 75% SN and 80% SP for 
partial-thickness IS tear, and 95% SN and 86.6% SP for subscapularis (SC) tear.
CONCLUSION: The MRI RCT investigation had a high SN, SP, and PPV compared to 
arthroscopy. The most frequently involved tendon reported in the present study 
was SS (n=35; 97.22%) followed by IS (n=32; 88.88%) and SC (n=22; 61.11%). The 
teres minor tendon was least commonly affected (n=0). Moreover, 61.11% (n=22) of 
the patients had joint effusion, 41.66% (n=15) had subacromial-subdeltoid bursal 
effusion, and 27.77% (n=10) had subcoracoid effusion, suggesting that RCT 
include joint effusion or bursal fluid. Acromioclavicular (AC) joint hypertrophy 
was found in 53% (n=19) of the patients, and 90% (n=17) were over 45 years old, 
indicating an association between age, AC joint hypertrophy, and RCT. Therefore, 
MRI has a good SN and SP for detecting various RCT. Therefore, it could be used 
to investigate a suspected RCT and should be considered a near-reference 
standard to arthroscopy for RCT diagnosis.

Familial Mediterranean fever is a rare autosomal recessive autoinflammatory 
disorder prevalent in Middle Eastern populations, characterized by episodic 
abdominal pain. This case report presents a 34-year-old Egyptian man with severe 
lower abdominal pain, chest discomfort, and joint pain, along with a positive 
family history of familial Mediterranean fever but had no previous personal 
history of this condition. Blood work revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia 
and elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The patient 
received intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and analgesics before further 
evaluation. Diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever relies on clinical 
symptoms, ethnic origin, and family history, supported by specific criteria. 
Typical familial Mediterranean fever attacks involve serositis-induced pain, 
recurrent episodes, short-duration fever (12 h to 3 days), and arthritis. 
Familial Mediterranean fever may mimic other acute abdominal conditions, 
warranting consideration, particularly in individuals from Mediterranean 
regions. Genetic testing is valuable in confirming familial Mediterranean fever 
diagnosis.

Nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and cartilage endplate constitute an 
avascular intervertebral disc (IVD), which is crucial for spinal and 
intervertebral joint mobility. As one of the most widespread health issues 
worldwide, intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is recognized as a key 
contributor to back and neck discomfort. A number of degenerative disorders have 
a strong correlation with ferroptosis, a recently identified novel regulated 
cell death (RCD) characterized by an iron-dependent mechanism and a buildup of 
lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). There is growing interest in the part 
ferroptosis plays in IVDD pathophysiology. Inhibiting ferroptosis has been shown 
to control IVDD development. Several studies have demonstrated that in 
TBHP-induced oxidative stress models, changes in ferroptosis marker protein 
levels and increased lipid peroxidation lead to the degeneration of 
intervertebral disc cells, which subsequently aggravates IVDD. Similarly, IVDD 
is significantly relieved with the use of ferroptosis inhibitors. The purpose of 
this review was threefold: 1) to discuss the occurrence of ferroptosis in IVDD; 
2) to understand the mechanism of ferroptosis and its role in IVDD 
pathophysiology; and 3) to investigate the feasibility and prospect of 
ferroptosis in IVDD treatment.

Isotropic multichannel total variation framework for joint reconstruction of 
multicontrast parallel MRI.

Esfahani EE(1).

Author information:
(1)Independent Researcher, Tehran, Iran.

Purpose: To develop a synergistic image reconstruction framework that exploits 
multicontrast (MC), multicoil, and compressed sensing (CS) redundancies in 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Approach: CS, MC acquisition, and parallel 
imaging (PI) have been individually well developed, but the combination of the 
three has not been equally well studied, much less the potential benefits of 
isotropy within such a setting. Inspired by total variation theory, we introduce 
an isotropic MC image regularizer and attain its full potential by integrating 
it into compressed MC multicoil MRI. A convex optimization problem is posed to 
model the new variational framework and a first-order algorithm is developed to 
solve the problem. Results: It turns out that the proposed isotropic regularizer 
outperforms many of the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods not only in 
terms of rotation-invariance preservation of symmetrical features, but also in 
suppressing noise or streaking artifacts, which are normally encountered in PI 
methods at aggressive undersampling rates. Moreover, the new framework 
significantly prevents intercontrast leakage of contrast-specific details, which 
seems to be a difficult situation to handle for some variational and low-rank MC 
reconstruction approaches. Conclusions: The new framework is a viable option for 
image reconstruction in fast protocols of MC parallel MRI, potentially reducing 
patient discomfort in otherwise long and time-consuming scans.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is often asymptomatic when it is small to medium in 
size, up to a maximum of 8 cm, in this case, a patient presented to the vascular 
surgery department with a complaint of acute pain in the left lower extremity 
with pallor due to the presence of arterial obstruction. On physical 
examination, we found a large pulsating mass in the abdomen. After performing a 
multislice computed tomography, we confirmed the presence of aneurysm with 
diameters of 13 × 8 cm below the level of the renal arteries. The rarity of this 
case in the medical literature come from that the aneurysm has reached this size 
and did not even rupture and did not cause any digestive discomfort or abdominal 
pain only complicated with an arterial obstruction in the lower left extremity 
as a result of the dissection that occurred. An emergency surgical operation was 
performed to remove the aneurysm and install the Dacron joint, and the patient 
was placed for 24 hours under intensive care and discharged after 5 days to have 
excellent results with the patient's condition improving without any 
complications after the operation. In conclusion, aneurysms constitute a serious 
condition facing vascular surgeons, especially if they are large in size without 
any symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 
the oral intake of promerim in the elimination of acute pain and discomfort 
associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: Single-center, 1-month, prospective, observational clinical trial. A 
total of 92 patients not older than 70 years were included. Patients were 
offered to use 720-mg promerim for the first 15 days after admission after 
breakfast and then 360 mg for the second 15 days. All patients were analyzed 
with the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, which ranges from 0 to 10, and the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score 
before the start of treatment and 1 month after the start. Statistical analysis 
was performed by SPSS 15.0 software. An α level of P < .05 was assumed to be 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: This study comprised 92 patients (69 women and 23 men) with a mean age 
of 51.5 (range: 40-69) years. Before treatment, the mean VAS score was 
5.6 ± 1.1, and after treatment, the mean VAS score was 2.6 ± 1.7. Treatment with 
promerim consistently showed a significant decrease in the VAS score (P < .001). 
The mean WOMAC score of the patients was 46.4 ± 8.2 before treatment. After 
treatment, the mean WOMAC score was 72.1 ± 14.4. Treatment with promerim 
consistently showed a significant increase in the WOMAC score (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this single-center, open-label clinical study 
demonstrate that promerim is a viable natural treatment option for treating knee 
OA. We recommend that 720-mg promerim taken once daily for the first 15 days 
after admission and 360 mg taken once daily for the next 15 days significantly 
and rapidly reduced composite pain and stiffness in the knee OA within 1 month.

INTRODUCTION: Fractures of the talus and its associated hindfoot dislocations 
are uncommon. They usually result from high-energy trauma. These fractures can 
lead to permanent disability. Optimal treatment relies on accurate evaluation of 
the injury with proper imaging to identify the fracture pattern and associated 
injuries and to be able to make an appropriate pre-operative plan. Avoiding 
soft-tissue complications, avascular necrosis, and post-traumatic arthrosis are 
the main goal of treatment.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of concomitant left talar neck and body fracture 
associated with a fracture of the medial malleolus in a 46-year-old male. We 
performed a closed reduction of the subtalar joint followed by an open reduction 
internal fixation of the talar neck/body and medial malleolus fractures.
CONCLUSION: At 12 weeks following the treatment, the patient had good movement 
with minimal discomfort on dorsiflexion, he was able to ambulate with no limp. 
Radiographs showed appropriate healing of the fracture. The patient was able to 
go back to his work with no restrictions as of publication of this report. Talus 
fracture dislocations are not benign in nature. Meticulous attention to 
soft-tissue management, anatomic reduction and fixation as well as adequate 
post-operative follow-up is needed to obtain a satisfactory outcome and avoid 
the detrimental sequalae of avascular necrosis and post-traumatic arthrosis.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: The intratendinous ganglion cyst is an extremely 
rare entity. Thus, the global incidence has not been reported yet. The 
literature search showed scarce case reports and none has reported its 
occurrence in extensor indicis propius (EIP) tendon. The benign nature and the 
region at the dorsal hand mimic to the more common dorsal wrist ganglion. 
However, the surgical treatment arises significant risk to the function and may 
require subsequent tendon graft or tendon transfer.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old-female presented with 4 years history of a 
slow-growing lump over the dorsal region of the right hand with discomfort 
during finger motions. The ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of dorsal 
wrist ganglion.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Intraoperatively, unlike the common presentation which is 
the well encapsulated mass originating from the carpal joint, the mass was found 
within the EIP tendon sheath and infiltrate the tendon substance. Surgical 
debulking was done and left the tendon partially intact. The frayed part was 
trimmed to ensure a smooth gliding. On the 6 month follow up, patient was 
symptom-free without any recurrence.
CONCLUSION: The intratendinous growth of a ganglion must be identified 
preoperatively for a proper management plan and inform consent. The 
intratendinous ganglion cysts frequently weaken the tendon. Hence, surgical 
excision is necessary with the preparation of secondary tendon reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: Lunate dislocation is an uncommon traumatic wrist injury that 
require prompt surgical management. Misdiagnosis or delayed treatment often 
leads to a poor outcome. Open reduction and surgical repair of disrupted 
ligaments are done in most cases to prevent long-term joint dysfunction. 
However, this method has certain limitations that include partial functional 
improvement, which poses a high risk for degenerative arthritis and wrist 
instability.
CASE SUMMARY: A 37-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department of our 
hospital following a motorcycle accident. Physical examination revealed swelling 
and tenderness of the right hand and wrist. The patient was initially 
misdiagnosed with a wrist contusion by an emergency physician, but was 
eventually diagnosed with lunate dislocation associated with a triquetral 
avulsed fracture, indicated for open reduction and ligament repair. We performed 
closed reduction and two Kirschner wire fixations following Tavernier's method. 
The injured hand was protected with a standard short-arm orthosis for one month. 
The patient returned to normal daily work without discomfort at five months 
postoperatively. Encouragingly, there was no lunate necrosis or arthritis in the 
latest radiologic examinations.
CONCLUSION: This case provides evidence that the closed reduction technique for 
addressing such cases can reduce soft tissue destruction.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence and age and gender profiles of hyperplasia 
in individual cervical vertebrae.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, computed tomography three-dimensional 
reconstruction images of cervical vertebrae from patients with neck discomfort 
were analyzed for the presence of hyperplasia and compared with age and gender 
data.
RESULTS: Scans from a total of 580 patients (352 males, 228 females) were 
analyzed. The highest incidence of hyperplasia was seen in C2 (25%), followed by 
C1 (23%), C6 (16%), C5 (15%), C7 (9%), C4 (8%) and C3 (4%). Patients with C2 
hyperplasia were the youngest and those with C1 hyperplasia were the second 
youngest, while patients with C7 hyperplasia were the oldest. Of those with C2, 
C1 and C7 hyperplasia, males were significantly younger than females, whereas of 
those with C3, C4, C5 and C6 hyperplasia, females were significantly younger 
than males.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperplasia of the cervical spine shows different age and gender 
profiles among the seven vertebrae. These findings may be helpful for the early 
recognition of cervical hyperplasia and highlight the importance of protecting 
the atlanto-axial joint in daily life.

Physical therapy intervention for a former power lifter after arthroscopic 
microfracture procedure for grade iv glenohumeral chondral defects.

Hensley CP, Sum J.

BACKGROUND: Power lifting places the shoulder complex at risk for injury. 
Microfracture is a relatively new procedure for chondral defects of the 
glenohumeral joint and is not well described in the literature.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this case report is to describe the post-operative 
rehabilitation used with a power lifter who underwent a microfracture procedure 
to address glenoid and humeral chondral defects, debridement of type I superior 
labral anterior-posterior lesion, and a subacromial decompression.
CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 46 year-old male who was evaluated nine 
weeks status-post arthroscopic microfracture procedure for glenoid and humeral 
chondral defects, debridement of superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) 
lesion, and subacromial decompression. Rehabilitation consisted of postural 
education, manual therapy, rotator cuff and scapular strengthening, dynamic 
stabilization, weightbearing exercises, and weight training over nine weeks (24 
sessions). Lifting modifications were addressed.
OUTCOMES: Results of the QuickDASH indicate that activities of daily living 
(ADLs), work, and sports modules all improved significantly, and the patient was 
able to return to recreational power lifting with limited discomfort or 
restrictions.
DISCUSSION: A structured post-operative physical therapy treatment program 
allowed this patient to return to recreational power lifting while restoring 
independent function for work-related activities and ADLs.

Athletic dogs are more susceptible to musculoskeletal disorders, especially in 
the muscles or tendons surrounding the shoulder joint. In this report, we 
describe a case of partial bilateral rupture of the infraspinatus muscle, an 
unusual injury. Clinical signs included lameness of the left thoracic limb after 
training. On physical examination, there was discomfort on bilateral palpation 
in the infraspinatus fossa region. The main clinical suspicion was partial 
rupture or myositis of the infraspinatus muscle (IF). Ultrasound examination of 
the region revealed the presence of hypoechoic areas intermingling the muscle 
fibers in a deeper and distal region of the infraspinatus muscle, compatible 
with edema or bilateral intramuscular hematoma (left +++, right ++) and 
integrity of the fascia. The findings were characterized as a partial rupture of 
the musculature. A detailed physical examination associated with ultrasound 
examination is essential for early diagnosis and therapeutic management. 
Although no other reports of partial rupture of the IF have been found, partial 
or complete rupture of muscle fibers in sport dogs is frequent. Early diagnosis 
prevents the development of contractures due to the institution of therapy 
before the fibrous process is established and improves prognosis.

Publisher: Os cães atléticos são mais suscetíveis a sofrer de distúrbios 
musculoesqueléticos, especialmente nos músculos ou tendões ao redor da 
articulação do ombro. Neste relato, é descrito um caso de ruptura parcial 
bilateral do músculo infraespinhal, uma lesão incomum. Os sinais clínicos 
incluíram claudicação no membro torácico esquerdo após o treinamento de corrida. 
Ao exame físico, havia desconforto à palpação bilateral em região da fossa 
infraespinhal. A principal suspeita clínica foi ruptura parcial ou miosite do 
músculo infraespinhal (IF). O exame ultrassonográfico da região revelou a 
presença de áreas hipoecóicas mesclando as fibras musculares em região mais 
profunda e distal do músculo infraespinhal, compatível com edema ou hematoma 
intramuscular bilateral (esquerdo +++, direito ++) e integridade da fáscia. Os 
achados foram caracterizados como ruptura parcial da musculatura. O exame físico 
detalhado associado ao exame de ultrassom foi essencial para o diagnóstico 
precoce e o manejo terapêutico. Embora nenhum outro relato de ruptura parcial do 
IF tenha sido encontrado, rupturas parciais ou totais das fibras musculares em 
cães esportivos são frequentes. O diagnóstico precoce evita o desenvolvimento de 
contraturas devido à instituição da terapia antes do estabelecimento do processo 
fibroso e melhora o prognóstico.

Variations in leg muscle are uncommon. Literature on this subject is scarce, but 
when those variations are reported they may cause alterations in joint mechanics 
or cause some discomfort in the leg and foot. The accessory soleus muscle (ASM) 
is considered an unusual anatomical variation, with an incidence of 0.5-6.0% in 
the population through studies in cadavers. During routine preparation of study 
material in the dissection room of the anatomy laboratory of the Escola Superior 
de Ciências da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Vitória/ES - Brazil, an ASM was 
found in the right inferior limb of a male cadaver fixed in 10% formalin. This 
supernumerary muscle was 3 cm wide, 9 cm long and 1 cm thick in its most 
voluminous part, in typical penniform fibers arrangement. It was located in the 
posteromedial region of the ankle, anterior to the Achilles tendon and posterior 
to the deep muscles of the leg compartment. Its anterior face covered the tibial 
nerve and the posterior tibial vessels, while its lower half was covered by the 
flexor retinaculum into the tarsal tunnel. Reports in the literature show 
possible compression of a neurovascular bundle because of its intimal position 
within the tarsal tunnel, which could result in ischemic compartment syndrome.

BACKGROUND: In the present study, the age- and sex-adjusted Constant score (CS) 
in a normal Indian population was calculated and any differences with other 
population cohorts assessed.
METHODS: The study participants were patients who visited the outpatient 
department for problems other than shoulder and healthy volunteers from the 
local population. Patients without shoulder pain/discomfort during activity were 
included in the study. Subjects with any problem that might affect shoulder 
function (e.g., cervical, thoracic spine, rib cage deformity, inflammatory 
arthritis) were excluded. Constant scoring of all participants was performed by 
trained senior residents under the supervision of the senior faculty. Shoulder 
range of movement and strength were measured following recommendations given by 
the research and Development Committee of the European Society for Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgery (2008). A fixed spring balance was used for strength measurement; 
one end was fixed on the floor and the other end tied with a strap to the wrist 
of the participant, arm in 90° abduction in scapular plane with palm facing 
down.
RESULTS: Among the 248 subjects (496 shoulders), the average age was 37 years 
(range, 18-78 years), 65.7% were males (326 shoulders) and 34.3% females (170 
shoulders). The mean CS was 84.6±2.9 (males, 86.1±3.0; females, 81.8±2.9). CS 
decreased significantly after 50 years of age in males and 40 years of age in 
females (p<0.05). The mean CS was lower than in previous studies for both males 
and females. Heavy occupation workers had higher mean CS (p<0.05). A linear 
standardized equation was estimated for calculating the adjusted CS for any age.
CONCLUSIONS: Mean CS and its change with age differed from previous studies 
among various population cohorts.

Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) in arthroplasty and 
osteosynthesis-associated infections (OAIs) in reconstructive surgery still 
represent a challenging complication in orthopaedics and traumatology causing a 
burden worsening the patient's quality of life, for caregiver and treating 
physicians, and for healthcare systems. PJIs and OAIs are the result of 
bacterial adhesion over an implant surface with subsequent biofilm formation. 
Therefore, the clinical pathological outcome is a difficult-to-eradicate 
persistent infection. Strategies to treat PJIs and OAIs involve debridement, the 
replacement of internal fixators or articular prostheses, and intravenous 
antibiotics. However, long treatments and surgical revision cause discomfort for 
patients; hence, the prevention of PJIs and OAIs represents a higher priority 
than treatment. Local antibiotic treatments through coating-release systems are 
becoming a smart approach to prevent this complication. Hydrophilic coatings, 
loaded with antibiotics, simultaneously provide a barrier effect against 
bacterial adhesion and allow for the local delivery of an antibiotic. The 
intraoperative use of a hyaluronan (HY)-derivative coating in the form of a gel, 
loaded with antibiotics to prevent PJI, has recently raised interest in 
orthopaedics. Current evidence supports the use of this coating in the 
prophylaxis of PJI and IRIs in terms of clinical outcomes and infection 
reduction. Thus, the purpose of this narrative review is to assess the use of a 
commercially available HY derivative in the form of a gel, highlighting the 
characteristics of this biomaterial, which makes it attractive for the 
management of PJIs and IRIs in orthopaedics and traumatology.

Purpose: The aim was to describe patients' lived experience of warmth and 
coldness in connection with surgery. Methods: A reflective lifeworld research 
(RLR) approach founded on phenomenology and the methodological principles of 
openness, flexibility, and bridling were used. The data consisted of 16 in-depth 
interviews with patients from four hospitals in Sweden. Results: Warmth and 
coldness in connection with surgery means an expectation to maintain one´s daily 
life temperature comfort. When patients' needs of temperature comfort is 
fulfilled it give a sense of well-being and calmness. Despite the body is 
covered there are feelings of vulnerability. When patients have the ability to 
change their own temperature comfort, they feel independent. Conclusion: The 
individual feeling of temperature comfort could be affected or changed to 
discomfort during the perioperative context, and an intervention is required to 
avoid suffering due to the care. An ability to independently influence one´s own 
temperature comfort can strengthen the patient, whereas the opposite entails 
suffering in silence. The phenomenon is also related to feelings of confidence 
about receiving the best care as well as being exposed and vulnerable. When the 
patient´s need of comfortable temperature is met then feelings of security and 
sense of well-being emerged.

BACKGROUND: Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint is one of the most common 
shoulder injuries in a sport-active population. The question of whether surgery 
should be used remains controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review 
first published in 2010.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus 
conservative (non-surgical) interventions for treating acromioclavicular 
dislocations in adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register (to June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to June 
2019), Embase (1980 to June 2019), and LILACS (1982 to June 2019), trial 
registries, and reference lists of articles. There were no restrictions based on 
language or publication status.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that 
compared surgical with conservative treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation 
in adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently 
performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data 
extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE to assess the 
quality of evidence for each outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial. 
The included trials involved 357 mainly young adults, the majority of whom were 
male, with acute acromioclavicular dislocation. The strength of the findings in 
all studies was limited due to design features, invariably lack of blinding, 
that carry a high risk of bias. Fixation of the acromioclavicular joint using 
hook plates, tunnelled suspension devices, coracoclavicular screws, 
acromioclavicular pins, or (usually threaded) wires was compared with supporting 
the arm in a sling or similar device. After surgery, the arm was also supported 
in a sling or similar device in all trials. Where described in the trials, both 
groups had exercise-based rehabilitation. We downgraded the evidence for all 
outcomes at least two levels, invariably for serious risk of bias and serious 
imprecision.Low-quality evidence from two studies showed no evidence of a 
difference between groups in shoulder function at one year, assessed using the 
Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) (0 (best 
function) to 100 (worst function)): mean difference (MD) 0.73 points, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -2.70 to 4.16; 112 participants. These results were 
consistent with other measures of function at one-year or longer follow-up, 
including non-validated outcome scores reported by three studies. There is 
low-quality evidence that function at six weeks may be better after conservative 
treatment, indicating an earlier recovery. Very low-quality evidence from one 
trial found no difference between groups in participants reporting pain at one 
year: risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.19; 79 participants. There is very 
low-quality evidence that surgery may not reduce the risk of treatment failure, 
usually resulting in non-routine secondary surgery: 14/168 versus 15/174; RR 
0.99, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.94; 342 participants, 6 studies. The main source of 
treatment failure was complications related to surgical implants in the surgery 
group and persistent symptoms, mainly discomfort, due to the acromioclavicular 
dislocation in the conservatively treated group.There is low-quality evidence 
from two studies that there may be little or no difference between groups in the 
return to former activities (sports or work) at one year: 57/67 versus 62/70; RR 
0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10; 137 participants, 2 studies. Low-quality but 
consistent evidence from four studies indicated an earlier recovery in 
conservatively treated participants compared with those treated with surgery. 
There is low-quality evidence of no clinically important difference between 
groups at one year in quality of life scores, measured using the 36-item or 
12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 or SF-12) (0-to-100 scale, where 100 is 
best score), in either the physical component (MD -0.63, 95% CI -2.63 to 1.37; 
122 participants, 2 studies) or mental component (MD 0.47 points, 95% CI -1.51 
to 2.44; 122 participants). There is very low-quality and clinically 
heterogenous evidence of a greater risk of an adverse event after surgery: 
45/168 versus 16/174; RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.82; 342 participants, 6 studies; 
I2 = 48%. Common adverse outcomes were hardware complications or discomfort 
(18.5%) and infection (8.7%) in the surgery group and persistent symptoms 
(7.1%), mainly discomfort, in the conservatively treated group. The majority of 
surgical complications occurred in older studies testing now-outdated devices 
known for their high risk of complications. The very low-quality evidence from 
one study (70 participants) means that we are uncertain whether there is a 
between-group difference in patient dissatisfaction with cosmetic results.It is 
notable that the evidence for function, return to former activities, and quality 
of life came from the two most recently conducted studies, which tested 
currently used devices and interventions in clearly defined participant 
populations that represented the commonly perceived population for which there 
is uncertainty over the use of surgery. There were insufficient data to conduct 
subgroup analysis relating to type of injury and whether surgery involved 
ligament reconstruction or not.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low-quality evidence that surgical treatment has 
no additional benefits in terms of function, return to former activities, and 
quality of life at one year compared with conservative treatment. There is, 
however, low-quality evidence that people treated conservatively had improved 
function at six weeks compared with surgical management. There is very 
low-quality evidence of little difference between the two treatments in pain at 
one year, treatment failure usually resulting in secondary surgery, or patient 
satisfaction with cosmetic result. Although surgery may result in more people 
sustaining adverse events, this varied between the trials, being more common in 
techniques such as K-wire fixation that are rarely used today. There remains a 
need to consider the balance of risks between the individual outcomes: for 
example, surgical adverse events, including wound infection or dehiscence and 
hardware complication, against risk of adverse events that may be more commonly 
associated with conservative treatment such as persistent symptoms or 
discomfort, or both.There is a need for sufficiently powered, good-quality, 
well-reported randomised trials of currently used surgical interventions versus 
conservative treatment for well-defined injuries.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pain in patients with RA 
in clinical remission and analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics 
of those who experienced persistent pain despite remission status.
METHODS: Data from 1,891 patients with RA registered on the Korean College of 
Rheumatology Biologics and Targeted Therapy registry were obtained. Remission 
was defined as a Disease Activity Score of 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR) <2.6. Pain intensity was classified as severe (pain visual analog 
scale [VAS] ≥7), moderate (4≤VAS<7), or mild (VAS <4).
RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 52.6% of patients complained of severe pain at 
the start of or during switching biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs (bDMARDs) or targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Despite having a 36.0% 
(n=680) remission rate after the use of bDMARDs or tsDMARDs at their 1-year 
follow-up, 21.5% (n=146) of these patients had moderate-to-severe pain, higher 
frequency of foot erosions, and comorbidities, such as mental illness, 
endocrine, renal, and neurological disorders, than patients with a milder degree 
of pain. The multivariable regression analysis showed that presence of foot 
erosions, neurological disorders, and use of corticosteroids were independently 
associated with moderate-to-severe pain in patients with RA despite being in 
remission. The level of ESR and use of Janus kinase inhibitors were inversely 
associated with moderate-to-severe pain.
CONCLUSION: Persistent pain and discomfort continue to be a problem for patients 
with RA in clinical remission. Continued research on insistent pain in patients 
with RA is warranted to better alleviate distress and improve the quality of 
life in patients.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of exercise and staying active are widely reported in 
the literature, however adherence and engagement with exercise amongst people 
with long-term illness and diabetes is poor. Physiotherapy aims to promote 
independence and physical activity using a range of strategies, including manual 
therapy and education/advice on exercises. However, low adherence impacts 
negatively on treatment outcomes. In this study, the practicality of 
physiotherapy interventions in patients who participate in a proof-of-concept 
(PoC) randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be considered.
AIM: To explore the experiences of people with diabetes who received an 
intervention package of foot and ankle mobilisations combined with home 
stretches for a 6-week period.
DESIGN: An embedded qualitative study in a proof-of-concept RCT using 
semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of 16 participants (mean age 73 years) with a 
diagnosis of diabetes (mean duration 13.4 years) were recruited.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed seven themes informing the adherence and 
non-adherence to the exercise intervention. Themes describing the positive 
experiences were: 1) support from others to do the exercises; 2) psychological 
factors to motivate exercise adherence; 2) physical factors contributing to 
exercise adherence; 4) acceptability of home exercises during and beyond the 
study. Other themes described barriers: 5) social factors that contributed to 
exercise disengagement; 6) emotional limitations that influence exercise 
avoidance; 7) physical circumstances that made exercise participation 
burdensome. Themes highlighted positive influences by physiotherapists, the 
motivation of doing exercises while participating in a study, improving the 
perceived range of motion in their foot and ankle and reducing discomfort in 
these joints whilst being more active with daily activities.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted that the intervention of foot and ankle 
mobilisations combined with home stretches is feasible for study participants. 
Psycho-social support, self-efficacy, and physiotherapy support are motivational 
to adhere to the study intervention and might contribute to the success of a 
full-scale RCT.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting up to 3% of the general 
population, associated with discomfort and impaired quality of life. In recent 
years, the pathogenic cytokine network of psoriasis has been extensively studied 
leading to the development of new treatments that provide greater efficacy. 
Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) has been recognized as a crucial cytokine that mediates 
immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. Ixekizumab - indicated for the treatment of 
adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis - is a subcutaneously 
administered humanized monoclonal antibody that targets IL-17A. A large 
percentage of patients affected by psoriasis achieved consistent benefits in 
terms of disease control and rapid onset of action during clinical trials. 
Overall, ixekizumab brought clinical improvement and a favorable safety profile 
in phase III trials. Ixekizumab is characterized by consistent efficacy and 
rapid onset of response; it is not influenced by previous exposure to biologics 
and has shown good results in areas that are difficult to treat and in severe 
clinical variants of psoriasis. Ixekizumab has shown significant improvements in 
the activity of the disease and in those physical functions that inhibit 
radiographic progression in patients with concomitant involvement of joints. Our 
data support ixekizumab as a successful therapeutic option for patients affected 
by moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the best available evidence for efficacy of paracetamol 
(acetaminophen) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs).
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Scientific Citation Index, CINAHL, Cochrane 
Library, and conference abstracts in the past 2 years from the British Society 
for Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, the American College 
of Rheumatology, and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International.
SUBJECTS: 10 RCTs including 1712 patients with either symptomatic OA of the knee 
(6 trials) or hip/knee (3 trials) or multiple joints (1 trial).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (a). effect size (ES) for pain, stiffness, and functional 
scores from baseline to end point; (b). rate ratio (RR) and number needed to 
treat for clinical response rate and patient preference for treatment.
RESULTS: Paracetamol was effective in relieving pain due to OA (ES = 0.21, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.41). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) were better than paracetamol for pain relief (ES = 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 
0.30). Clinical response rate was higher with NSAIDs than with paracetamol (RR = 
1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.41), and the number of patients who preferred NSAIDs was 
more than twice the number of those preferring paracetamol (RR = 2.46, 95% CI 
1.51 to 4.12). NSAIDs were associated with more frequent gastrointestinal 
discomfort than paracetamol (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75).
CONCLUSION: Paracetamol is an effective agent for pain relief due to OA. 
Although safer, it is less effective than NSAIDs. For safety reasons paracetamol 
should be the first line treatment, with NSAIDs reserved for those who do not 
respond.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is considered a multi-system 
disease that might present with or develop complications during the acute phase 
of illness. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of 
musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations in patients with COVID-19 infection and 
investigate their clinical correlations.
METHODS: This study was carried out on 110 patients with a history of RT-PCR 
confirmed COVID-19 infection. They completed a questionnaire that covered 
detailed information on their sociodemographic characteristics, clinical data of 
COVID-19 infection in addition to MSK discomfort form based on the Nordic MSK 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 37.7 years (SD 12.9), 72.7% were 
females. The majority of patients (90.9%) reported MSK symptoms that occur 
during or shortly after the acute attack of COVID-19 infection. The median 
duration of onset of MSK symptoms was 2 days from the first day of COVID-19 
infection (min-max: 0-45 days) with a median duration of MSK symptoms of 7 days. 
Myalgia was the main complaint (85.5%) followed by arthralgia 90 (81.8%). 
However, swollen joints were reported in only 9 patients (8.2%). According to 
the body areas, maximum number of patients felt pain at the lower back (60%), 
followed by neck (39.1%), and upper back (32.5%) followed by right and left 
shoulder (20.9%). Patients with MSK manifestations were associated higher 
severity of COVID-19 infection (p < 0.001), prolonged duration of COVID-19 
symptoms (p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of fatigue (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: MSK manifestations are common in COVID-19 patients and related to 
disease severity, duration and fatigue.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study investigated the effects of orally 
administered α-tocopherol-loaded polycaprolactone nanoparticles on the articular 
inflammation and systemic oxidative status of middle-aged Holtzman rats with 
Freund's adjuvant-induced polyarthritis, a model for rheumatoid arthritis. 
Intraperitoneally administered free α-tocopherol provided the reference for 
comparison.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Two protocols of treatment were followed: 
intraperitoneal administration of free α-tocopherol (100 mg/kg i.p.) or oral 
administration of free and nanoencapsulated α-tocopherol (100 mg/kg p.o.). 
Animals were treated during 18 days after arthritis induction.
RESULTS: Free (i.p.) and encapsulated α-tocopherol decreased the hind paws 
edema, the leukocytes infiltration into femorotibial joints and the mRNA 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tibial anterior muscle of 
arthritic rats, but the encapsulated compound was more effective. Free (i.p.) 
and encapsulated α-tocopherol decreased the high levels of reactive oxygen 
species in the brain and liver, but only the encapsulated compound decreased the 
levels of protein carbonyl groups in these organs. Both free (i.p.) and 
encapsulated α-tocopherol increased the α-tocopherol levels and the ratio of 
reduced to oxidized glutathione in these organs.
CONCLUSION: Both intraperitoneally administered free α-tocopherol and orally 
administered encapsulated α-tocopherol effectively improved inflammation and 
systemic oxidative stress in middle-aged arthritic rats. However, the 
encapsulated form should be preferred because the oral administration route does 
not be linked to the evident discomfort that is caused in general by injectable 
medicaments. Consequently, α-tocopherol-loaded polycaprolactone nanoparticles 
may be a promising adjuvant to the most current approaches aiming at rheumatoid 
arthritis therapy.

BACKGROUND: Synovial sarcoma, a rare mesenchymal tumor type with unclear 
histological origin and direction of differentiation, accounts for 6%-10% of 
soft tissue tumors. It is mainly located near the joints and tendons of the 
limbs, and occurs primarily in children or young adults. Primary renal synovial 
sarcoma (PRSS) is very rare, accounting for approximately 1% of synovial 
sarcomas. It is a spindle cell tumor type affecting mesenchymal tissue, and has 
morphological, genetic, and clinical characteristics, and a certain degree of 
epithelial differentiation. It is highly malignant and has the fourth highest 
incidence among soft tissue sarcomas. Here, we report a case of PRSS and share 
some valuable information about the disease.
CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for a 
space-occupying lesion in the right kidney for 2 d upon ultrasound examination. 
The patient had no cold or fever; no frequency, urgency or pain of urination; 
and no other discomfort. The results of a hemogram, blood biochemistry, and 
tumor markers were in the normal range. The patient was examined by computed 
tomography (CT), which indicated the presence of a soft tissue density shadow 
with a diameter of approximately 6.8 cm in the right renal pelvis area, showing 
uneven enhancement. Ultrasound indicated a cystic solid mass of approximately 
6.8 cm × 6.5 cm in the right kidney, with an unclear boundary and irregular 
shape. Meanwhile, color Doppler flow imaging showed dotted blood flow signals in 
the periphery and interior. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) showed "slow in 
and fast out" hyperenhancement of the right renal mass after contrast agent 
injection. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was (right kidney) synovial 
sarcoma. Despite postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor recurrence was 
detected two years later.
CONCLUSION: PRSS is a rare malignant tumor. To date, no characteristic imaging 
findings have been observed. The diagnosis is confirmed primarily through 
postoperative pathological immunohistochemistry and SS18 (SYT) gene detection. 
In this case, CEUS was used preoperatively. We found that PRSS has the 
characteristic of "slow in and fast out" hyperenhancement, and its particular 
characteristics have diagnostic value. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is 
not very effective.

Human and veterinary medicine have historically presented many medical areas of 
potential synergy and convergence. Mechanical osteoarthritis (MOA) is 
characterized by a gradual complex imbalance between cartilage production, loss, 
and derangement. Any joint instability that results in an abnormal overload of 
the joint surface can trigger MOA. As MOA has a prevailing mechanical aetiology, 
treatment effectiveness can only be accomplished if altered joint mechanics and 
mechanosensitive pathways are normalized and restored. Otherwise, the 
inflammatory cascade of osteoarthritis will be initiated, and the changes may 
become irreversible. The management of the disease using non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, physical therapy, diet changes, or 
nutraceuticals is conservative and less effective. MOA is a determinant factor 
for the development of hip dysplasia in both humans and dogs. Hip dysplasia is a 
hereditary disease with a high incidence and, therefore, of great clinical 
importance due to the associated discomfort and significant functional 
limitations. Furthermore, on account of analogous human and canine hip dysplasia 
disease and under the One Medicine concept, unifying veterinary and human 
research could improve the well-being and health of both species, increasing the 
acknowledgement of shared diseases. Great success has been accomplished in 
humans regarding preventive conservative management of hip dysplasia and 
following One Medicine concept, similar measures would benefit dogs. Moreover, 
animal models have long been used to better understand the different diseases' 
mechanisms. Current research in animal models was addressed and the role of 
rabbit models in pathophysiologic studies and of the dog as a spontaneous animal 
model were highlighted, denoting the inexistence of rabbit functional models to 
investigate therapeutic approaches in hip MOA.

BACKGROUND: Under the assumption that a certain degree of degeneration is normal 
in old age, the changes that significantly lead to discomfort should be 
identified. Care should be taken to ensure that the geriatric patient receives 
adequate treatment and can quickly return to a normal pain-free life.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed on symptomatic 
outpatients who came for a magnetic resonance (MR) examination of the spine. The 
presence of spinal stenosis, osteochondrotic and spondylarthrotic changes and 
nerve root affections were assessed. A brief interview was conducted to assess 
impairment of daily life, duration of symptoms until contact with the physician, 
and resulting impairment. The results were correlated with age, the groups of 
patients under and over 65 years of age, and the pain score.
RESULTS: Age is significantly positively correlated with facet joint arthrosis, 
spinal stenosis, osteochondrotic changes and intraforaminal nerve root 
affection. There is no significant correlation between the pain score and age. 
The pain score shows significant correlation to nerve root affection, facet 
joint osteoarthritis and spinal constriction. The duration of pain until a visit 
to the treating physician is significantly shorter in older patients, while the 
impairments in everyday life are significantly more pronounced under the 
existing back pain.
CONCLUSION: Age itself is not correlated with pain perception. Isolated features 
such as nerve root affection and facet joint arthrosis show a positive 
correlation with the pain. The older patient goes to the doctor more quickly 
because the back pain is perceived as a restriction of daily life.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Unter der Vorstellung, dass ein 
gewisses Maß an Degeneration im Alter normal ist, sollten die Veränderungen 
erkannt werden, die signifikant zu Beschwerden führen. Es sollte sichergestellt 
werden, dass der geriatrische Patient adäquat behandelt wird und schnell wieder 
in sein normales, schmerzfreies Leben zurückfinden kann.
METHODIK: Durchgeführt wurde eine prospektive Untersuchung an symptomatischen 
Patienten, die zu einer MR-Untersuchung der Wirbelsäule kamen. Es wurden das 
Vorliegen einer Spinalkanalstenose, osteochondrotische und spondylarthrotische 
Veränderungen sowie Nervenwurzelaffektionen beurteilt. In einem Kurzinterview 
wurden die Beeinträchtigungen im Alltag, Dauer der Beschwerden bis zur 
Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Arzt und daraus resultierende Beeinträchtigungen 
erhoben. Die Ergebnisse wurden mit dem Alter, der Gruppe der Patienten unter und 
über 65 Lebensjahre sowie mit dem Schmerzscore korreliert.
ERGEBNISSE: Das Alter ist signifikant positiv korreliert mit der 
Facettengelenkarthrose, spinaler Einengung, osteochondrotischen Veränderungen 
und der intraforaminalen Nervenwurzelaffektion. Es zeigt sich keine signifikante 
Korrelation zwischen Schmerzscore und Lebensalter. Der Schmerzscore zeigt eine 
signifikante Korrelation für die Nervenwurzelaffektion, Facettengelenkarthrose 
und spinale Enge. Die Schmerzdauer ist beim älteren Patienten signifikant 
kürzer, bis er den behandelnden Arzt aufsucht, während die Beeinträchtigungen im 
Alltag signifikant stärker ausgeprägt sind.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Das Alter selbst ist nicht mit Schmerzempfinden korreliert. 
Isolierte Merkmale wie Nervenwurzelaffektion und Facettengelenkarthrose zeigen 
eine positive Korrelation zum Schmerz. Der ältere Patient geht schneller zum 
Arzt, da er den Rückenschmerz als Einschränkung seines täglichen Lebens 
empfindet.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacist involvement has been shown to improve various aspects of 
patient care. Patients undergoing knee and hip replacement surgery generally 
experience post-operative pain and discomfort. Pain control can impact patient 
satisfaction, as reported by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey.
OBJECTIVE: The current pilot study aims to measure the potential impact that 
incorporating pharmacists into preoperative patient education programs has on 
the response to select HCAHPS questions.
METHODS: Patient responses to two select HCAHPS questions related to pain were 
recorded for a year prior to pharmacist involvement in a comprehensive 
preoperative patient education program (2012) and a year after pharmacists 
became actively involved (2013).
RESULTS: In all reporting surgical patients, there was a modest 3.68% 
improvement in mean scores reflecting patient's feelings that hospital staff did 
"everything they could" to attend to their pain (mean2012=3.66, SD=0.63 versus 
mean2013=3.80, SD=0.43, p=0.018, Mann-Whitney U test). There was a 
non-significant 2.98% improvement in scores reflecting the level that pain was 
"well controlled" (mean2012=3.54, SD=0.651 versus mean2013=3.65, SD=0.554, 
p=0.069, Mann-Whitney U test) in surgical patients.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest comprehensive pharmacist involvement in patient 
education prior to joint replacement surgery may impact HCAHPS scores related to 
pain control. While the observed potential improvements were modest, the current 
results justify larger, multi-institution prospective studies to better 
elucidate the impact pharmacists can have on pain management in patients 
undergoing joint replacement.

The Hip Society: algorithmic approach to diagnosis and management of 
metal-on-metal arthroplasty.

Since 1996 more than one million metal-on-metal articulations have been 
implanted worldwide. Adverse reactions to metal debris are escalating. Here we 
present an algorithmic approach to patient management. The general approach to 
all arthroplasty patients returning for follow-up begins with a detailed 
history, querying for pain, discomfort or compromise of function. Symptomatic 
patients should be evaluated for intra-articular and extra-articular causes of 
pain. In large head MoM arthroplasty, aseptic loosening may be the source of 
pain and is frequently difficult to diagnose. Sepsis should be ruled out as a 
source of pain. Plain radiographs are evaluated to rule out loosening and 
osteolysis, and assess component position. Laboratory evaluation commences with 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, which may be elevated. 
Serum metal ions should be assessed by an approved facility. Aspiration, with 
manual cell count and culture/sensitivity should be performed, with cloudy to 
creamy fluid with predominance of monocytes often indicative of failure. Imaging 
should include ultrasound or metal artifact reduction sequence MRI, specifically 
evaluating for fluid collections and/or masses about the hip. If adverse 
reaction to metal debris is suspected then revision to metal or 
ceramic-on-polyethylene is indicated and can be successful. Delay may be 
associated with extensive soft-tissue damage and hence poor clinical outcome.

Total hip replacement (THR) is a very common procedure undertaken in up to 285 
000 Americans each year. Patient satisfaction with THR is very high, with 
improvements in general health, quality of life, and function while at the same 
time very cost effective. Although the majority of patients have a high degree 
of satisfaction with their THR, 27% experience some discomfort, and up to 6% 
experience severe chronic pain. Although it can be difficult to diagnose the 
cause of the pain in these patients, this clinical issue should be approached 
systematically and thoroughly. A detailed history and clinical examination can 
often provide the correct diagnosis and guide the appropriate selection of 
investigations, which will then serve to confirm the clinical diagnosis made.

The role of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in Asian hydrological climate is crucial, 
yet there is a lack of quantitative estimates regarding its impact on snowfall 
in China. Some opinions suggest that the TP functions as a large barrier that 
obstructs cold outbreaks, protecting southern China from severe snowstorms. 
Through topography experiments with and without the TP, our study suggests that 
the TP's presence results in a 60% decrease in snowfall in northern China by 
significantly reducing moisture. In contrast, it promotes a 1500% increase in 
snowfall in southern China, particularly from November to March, by drawing cold 
air from the north and moisture from the south to southern China. The presence 
of TP significantly enhances winter relative humidity in southern China, causing 
discomfort for humans. This research refutes some trending views and improves 
our understanding of the TP's role in China's winter climate.

The foot and the lower leg comprise the ankle joint complex. The foot is crucial 
for the maintenance of posture. Frequently, overuse or repeated microtrauma to 
the fascia causes plantar fasciitis. This review aims to suggest the efficacy of 
various plantar fasciitis (PF) interventions based on modifications in clinical 
results. This review included studies from 2019 to March 2023 identified through 
a systematic literature search. The measures used to predict improvement in 
pain, discomfort, and foot function symptoms included the Visual Analog scale, 
Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Pressure Point Threshold by algometer, 
Weight-Bearing Lunge Test by inch tape, and range of motion. The review included 
20 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Therapeutic interventions 
included insoles, foot orthosis, foam roller stretching, manual stretching, 
muscle strengthening, intrinsic muscle activities, extracorporeal shock wave 
lithotripsy, dry needling, laser, ultrasound, and others, which resulted in pain 
reduction, improved foot function, and ease of everyday routine. All therapeutic 
strategies used impacts resulting from minimal to maximal recovery. Various 
advanced approaches are more effective than conventional physical therapy. In 
conclusion, conservative therapeutic strategies with manual techniques, 
orthoses, and alternative intervention strategies can be combined to effectively 
relieve pain and improve function and overall results. Further high-quality 
studies are essential to learn more about the ideal dose, treatment approaches, 
and long-term impacts of these therapies.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease that can affect all ages, 
but it is more common in the elderly. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
treatments have been invented evolutionarily over the years to halt this 
disease. Exercise is one of the first-line treatments for knee OA as well as for 
prevention. This case study features a 47-year-old man who has grade IV 
bilateral knee OA and has never had any surgery and takes fish oil daily as a 
supplement. His walking pattern was significantly impacted by the chronic knee 
discomfort he had in both legs. Thus, the walking gait of this patient was 
analyzed together with core muscle activation before and after two weeks of core 
resistance exercise intervention. The knee pain score was assessed using the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC). The outcomes of this 
research depict that core resistance training has the potential to be used as an 
alternative, non-surgical and non-pharmacological treatment for a patient with 
knee OA.

CONTEXT: Due to increased life expectancy worldwide, women are expected to spend 
a significant portion of their lives in menopause. Proven prevention strategies 
against serious risks and tested effective treatments for common symptoms may 
remain unutilized in our population if these women are not asked about these 
symptoms.
AIM: This study aims to assess the prevalence of different menopausal symptoms 
and their severity according to menopause rating scale (MRS) in women.
SETTING AND DESIGN: The present study was a cross-sectional survey, conducted in 
the outpatient department of gynecology and obstetrics.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After written and informed consent, 121 women having their 
last menstrual period at least 1 year ago were included. The menopausal symptoms 
were assessed using the MRS. The primary outcome measure in this study was the 
prevalence of menopausal symptoms in these women according to MRS and the 
severity of these symptoms.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using the SPSS software program, 
version 15.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).
RESULTS: The most common symptom was mental and physical exhaustion which was 
reported by 88 (72%) women, followed by joint and muscular discomfort which was 
reported by 83 (68.59%). Hot flushes were reported by 54 (44.62%) respondents. 
Majority of women reported mild-to-moderate symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of menopausal symptoms is high, and a health policy 
needs to be generated for the region.

CONTEXT: Sport massage is often used to help prepare for exercise, expedite 
recovery from muscle soreness, and enhance athletic performance. However, the 
effect of sport massage on recovery from delayed-onset muscle soreness is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a short sport massage treatment on 
intramuscular swelling and pain in response to eccentric exercise.
DESIGN: We used a 2 x 8 (treatment x time) repeated-measures design to compare 
triceps surae muscle girth and pain ratings over the 72 hours after eccentric 
exercise.
SETTING: University research laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen healthy, college-aged subjects.
INTERVENTION(S): Delayed-onset muscle soreness was induced with several sets of 
eccentric triceps surae contractions at 90% of the estimated concentric, 
1-repetition maximum weight. Subjects returned on 3 consecutive days after 
eccentric exercise with a cycle ergometer for active rest treatments. In 
addition, 1 leg received the sport massage.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Girth measurements were taken at 5.08 cm (2 in), 10.16 
cm (4 in), 15.24 cm (6 in), and 20.32 cm (8 in) below the knee joint line, and 
pain was assessed with a visual analog scale before and after all 4 sessions.
RESULTS: No interaction was noted between treatment and time for any girth or 
pain measurements, and no main effect was seen for treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Sport massage did not reduce girth or pain in the lower leg after 
eccentric exercise within 72 hours.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies on cadavers dissection have shown that collateral 
branches of the trigeminal nerve cross muscle bundles on their way, being a 
possible etiological factor of some nerve disturbances.
CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man attended to the Temporomandibular Joint and 
Orofacial Pain Unit of the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology in Hospital 
Odontològic of Barcelona University, referring tingling in the left hemifacial 
región and ipsilateral lingual side for one year, with discomfort when shaving 
or skin compression.
DISCUSSION: Several branches of the trigeminal nerve follow a path through the 
masticatory muscles, being the lingual nerve and buccal nerve the most involved. 
The hyperactivity of the muscle bundles that are crossed by nerve structures 
generates a compression that could explain certain orofacial neuropathies 
(numbness and / or pain) in which a clear etiologic factor can not be 
identified.

OBJECTIVE: In Rheumatology, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has 
been widely prescribed and used. However, despite their clinical benefits in the 
management of inflammatory and degenerative joint disease, NSAIDs have 
considerable side effects, mostly affecting the upper gastrointestinal system, 
which therefore, limit their use. This study was conducted to determine the 
patients' knowledge and perception regarding the used of NSAIDS.
METHODS: A total of 120 patients who attended the rheumatology clinic Hospital, 
Raja Permaisuri Bainun, Malaysia, and received NSAIDs more than 3 months were 
interviewed irrespective of their rheumatological conditions. Patient's 
knowledge and perception on the side effects of NSAIDs were recorded.
RESULT: Fifty-four percent of the patients obtained information regarding the 
side effect of NSAIDs either from the rheumatologist, rheumatology staff nurse 
or other medical staffs (75.4%). The remaining 45.8% were naive of such 
knowledge. Fifteen percent obtained the information by surfing the internet and 
9.2% from printed media. Twenty-four (24.2%) patients, experienced indigestion 
and/or stomach discomfort attributed to NSAIDs used. Two patients (1.7%) had 
hematemesis and malena once.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that half of the patients who attended the 
rheumatology clinic were unaware of the side effect of NSAIDs. Available data 
showed that most of the knowledgeable patients are more conscience and 
self-educated. This study also reveals the important roles of clinicians, 
trained staff nurses as well as the pharmacist in providing the guidance and 
knowledge of any medication taken by patients.

Isfahan, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Injuries in hands and forearms may cause significant discomfort and 
disability.
AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of preoperative clinical examination in depicting 
lesions caused by penetrating wounds of hands or forearms.
SETTING AND DESIGN: This prospective study was conducted from August 2006 to 
September 2009 at Kashani University Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical 
Sciences, Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty patients with clean penetrating 
injury to the hand/forearm were enrolled in this study. After patient's data 
registration, a careful clinical examination and routine exploration without 
expansion of wound were done by an orthopedic resident. Each tendon was tested 
at each joint level. Nerves were evaluated with a two-point discrimination test, 
and arteries were tested with palpable pulses. Surgical exploration was done by 
a single hand surgeon in operation room. Accuracy of clinical examination was 
compared to surgical examination.
RESULTS: During the study period, 180 (72%) males and 70 (28%) females with mean 
age of 28±4 years participated. The preoperative examination showed a 
predominance of the volar zone IV injuries followed by volar zone II, III, thumb 
zone II, volar zone V and thumb zone III. Despite the enough accuracy of 
preoperative examinations in dorsal side injuries of hands and forearms (error 
rate = 8.3%), the preoperative examinations significantly underestimated the 
amount of damage to soft tissues on the volar side of hands and forearms (error 
rate = 14%).
CONCLUSIONS: The precise surgical evaluations should be considered in patients 
with penetrating injury to the hand or forearm, especially in those with volar 
side injuries.

BACKGROUND: Hip avulsion fractures occur mostly during adolescence when actions 
such as kicking or running cause forceful contraction of attached muscle. 
Osteochondroma is benign tumor that mostly occurs at the metaphysis of a long 
bone, being usually asymptomatic.
CASE SUMMARY: A 15-year-old patient experienced feeling and sound of a break 
while kicking a ball in soccer game three years prior to his visit to our 
hospital. A simple X-ray revealed an avulsion fracture of the apophysis of the 
anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS). Later in the follow-up X-ray, a palpable 
mass was found and demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging to be a 
pedunculated osteochondroma in the superolateral aspect of the AIIS. For 
surgical treatment, we performed osteotomy for surgical excision and excisional 
biopsy. A mass with smooth surface and an unclear superolateral AIIS border was 
found intraoperatively. Pathologic exam showed definite diagnosis of 
osteochondroma. Postoperatively, discomfort during hip flexion was improved, and 
the hip joint range of motion during walking was recovered at the last 
follow-up, which was three weeks after the surgery.
CONCLUSION: This is a rare case to demonstrate relevant previous trauma history 
prior to the formation of osteochondroma.

We report a rare case of osteochondromatosis of the posterior ankle 
extra-articular space with a longitudinal tear of flexor hallucis longus (FHL). 
A 77-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with an approximately 4-year 
history of pain and swelling in the right posterior ankle joint without obvious 
trauma. The pain had worsened in the previous 2 years. On presentation, she had 
tenderness at the posteromedial and posterolateral ankle. Imaging revealed 
several ossified loose bodies in the posterior ankle extra-articular space. We 
removed the loose bodies, performed tenosynovectomy around the FHL, and released 
the FHL tendon using a posterior arthroscopic technique via standard 
posterolateral and posteromedial portals. A longitudinal tear and fibrillation 
were detected in the FHL. The patient was able to return to her daily activities 
approximately 3 weeks after surgery. At the 1-year follow-up visit, she 
continued to have minor discomfort and slight swelling on the posteromedial 
aspect of the right ankle but had no recurrence of the ossified loose bodies. To 
our knowledge, this is the first report of osteochondromatosis of the posterior 
ankle extra-articular space with a longitudinal tear of the FHL that was treated 
by removal of loose bodies, tenosynovectomy around the FHL, and release of the 
FHL tendon via posterior ankle arthroscopy.

Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) present many musculoskeletal 
disorders. The purpose of this case report was to describe the effectiveness of 
a scapular motor control program for a patient with multidirectional severe 
shoulder instability due to EDS, with 6-month follow-up. The patient was a 
14-year-old female with EDS hypermobile type who suffered recurrent shoulder 
dislocation. Her chief complaints were bilateral shoulder discomfort and 
instability during writing motion. In the early part of intervention, she was 
prescribed exercise therapy for multidirectional instability (MDI) with 
orthosis. In the latter part of intervention, she was instructed in the scapular 
motor control program. Active and passive range of motion (ROM), sulcus sign, 
and Rowe score for shoulder instability were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 
and 12 months after interventions. The shoulder ROM and instability score were 
improved after 6-month intervention. The findings from this report indicate that 
the scapular motor control program for shoulder instability would be effective 
even for patients with EDS hypermobile type. A patient who could not increase 
passive ROM due to dislocation is also able to achieve fair function of the 
shoulder joint instead of increasing active ROM. These positive outcomes 
indicate the possibility of benefit from the scapular motor control program for 
an MDI patient with EDS as a conservative treatment.

A 52-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of recurrent fevers and 
joint pains accompanied by abdominal and low back discomfort. She has a history 
of hypoparathyroidism and is on calcium supplements. Physical examination 
revealed fever and tachycardia. The rest of the examination was normal. 
Laboratory tests showed newly increased transaminase activity. Serum bilirubin 
and prothrombin time were normal. She was admitted for evaluation of acute 
hepatitis. Serology for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV were negative. Her serum 
acetaminophen and alcohol were undetected. Abdominal imaging was normal. 
Cultures were sterile. Additional tests for uncommon viral hepatitis included 
herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Liver biopsy 
revealed non-specific inflammation. Subsequently, cytomegalovirus serology 
showed an IgM positive and negative IgG titre. Cytomegalovirus DNA qualitative 
PCR was also positive. No antiviral medication was given. She continued to have 
intermittent daily fever but reported no associated symptoms. She was discharged 
9 days after admission in stable condition per her request with the advice to 
follow-up in the clinic in 1 week. Her serum hepatic profile returned to normal 
and she reported no more episodes of fever. Repeated titres of cytomegalovirus 
serology showed seroconversion.

AIM: To evaluate the functional outcomes of the Bristow-Latarjet procedure in 
patients with recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Personal clinical records of 42 patients with 45 operated 
shoulders were reviewed retrospectively. Patient age at time of first 
dislocation, injury mechanism, and number of recurring dislocations before 
surgery were recorded. The overall function and stability of the shoulder was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Thirty five (78%) of the scapulohumeral humeral instabilities were 
caused by trauma. The mean number of recurring dislocations was 9 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0-18); one patient had had 17 recurrences. Mean 
follow-up 46 months (95% CI, 16-88). No dislocation happened postoperatively. 
Four patients have fibrous union (9%). Only two had clinical sign of pain and 
discomfort. One of them was reoperated for screw removal with very good 
post-operative result. The overall functional outcome was good, with a mean Rowe 
score of 88 points (95% CI, 78-100). Scores of 27 (64%) of the patients were 
excellent, 9 (22%) were good, 4 (9.5%) were fair, and 2 (4.5%) were poor.
CONCLUSION: The Bristow-Latarjet procedure is a very good surgical treatment for 
recurrent anterior-inferior instability of the glenohumeral joint. It must not 
be used for multidirectional instability or psychogenic habitual dislocations.

INTRODUCTION: It is considered that the lifestyle conditioned by 
socio-demographic or socio-economic factors determines the health condition of 
people to the greatest extent. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
influence of selected socio-demographic factors on the kinds of symptoms 
occurring during menopause.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 210 women aged 45 to 65, not 
using hormone replacement therapy, staying at healthcare centers for 
rehabilitation treatment. The study was carried out in 2013-2014 in the 
Silesian, Podlaskie and Lesser Poland voivodeships. The set of tools consisted 
of the authors' own survey questionnaire and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS).
RESULTS: The most commonly occurring symptom in the group of studied women was a 
depressive mood, from the group of psychological symptoms, followed by physical 
and mental fatigue, and discomfort connected with muscle and joint pain. The 
greatest intensity of symptoms was observed in the group of women with the 
lowest level of education, reporting an average or bad material situation, and 
unemployed women.
CONCLUSIONS: An alarmingly high number of reported psychological symptoms in the 
group of menopausal women was observed, and in particular among the group of low 
socio-economic status. Career seems to be a factor reducing the risk of 
occurrence of psychological symptoms. There is an urgent need for health 
promotion and prophylaxis in the group of menopausal women, and in many cases 
for implementation of specialist psychological assistance.

RATIONALE: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a polyethylene (PE) liner is 1 of 
the most effective and successful treatment strategies for end-stage hip 
disorders. Vitamin E-infused highly cross-linked polyethylene is theoretically 
known to prevent failure due to oxidative degradation in the body, and is 
resistant to wear; therefore, successful long-term survival of THA is expected.
PATIENT CONCERNS: In June 2019, approximately 1.5 years after THA, the patient 
sat down and stood up without any specific issue; however, an unusual bullet 
sound occurred around the left hip joint. Since then, his discomfort persisted, 
and he was admitted to the emergency department.
DIAGNOSIS: Plain radiography and metal artifact reduction computed tomography 
performed in the emergency department revealed eccentric elevation of the 
prosthetic femoral head and suspected PE liner failure.
INTERVENTION: Revision surgery was performed for modular component exchange. To 
reduce the dislocation risk without performing cup exchange, conversion to 
dual-mobility articulation was performed.
OUTCOMES: During the regular follow-up post-surgery, the patient could perform 
daily life activities without any discomfort, and dislocation was not observed. 
At 2 years postoperatively, no significant changes were observed in the 
radiographic images.
LESSONS: This case report presents an unexpected failure of THA due to superior 
rim fracture and excessive wear at the locking mechanism of the vitamin 
E-infused highly cross-linked polyethylene liner. This is an interesting case, 
as early PE liner failure occurred without strong labor intensity or trauma. A 
modular component exchange was performed with a dual-mobility bearing, and no 
issues were observed approximately 2 years after the reoperation. Therefore, 
third-generation highly cross-linked polyethylene liners can also cause early 
failure without a clear cause, and this case report highlights the necessity of 
considering several strategies for reoperation.
STUDY DESIGN: Case report.

Calcium fructoborate (CF), a natural sugar-borate ester found in fresh fruits 
and vegetables, is a source of soluble boron. CF contains three forms of borate 
(diester, monoester, and boric acid) and all are biologically active, both at 
the intracellular (as free boric acid) and extracellular level (as 
fructose-borate diester and monoester). At the cellular and molecular level, CF 
is superior to the boric acid/borate, exhibiting a complex "protective" effect 
against inflammatory response. CF is commercially available in the USA as a 
"nature-identical" complex, an active compound for dietary supplements. It 
provides effective and safe support against the discomfort and lack of 
flexibility associated with osteoarticular conditions (arthritis and joint 
degeneration), and improves Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and McGill indexes. In addition, orally administered CF 
is effective in ameliorating symptoms of physiological response to stress, 
including inflammation of the mucous membranes, discomfort associated with 
osteoarthritis disorders, and bone loss, and also for supporting cardiovascular 
health. Clinical studies have exhibited the ability of CF to significantly 
modulate molecular markers associated with inflammatory mechanisms, mainly on 
the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).

Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical 
indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane 
off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have 
only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, 
or professional lives; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe 
symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.  
Although premenstrual symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the 
diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for 
premenstrual disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from 
"menses moodiness" in the 18th century to "premenstrual tension" in the early 
part of the 19th century to finally, "premenstrual syndrome" in the 1950s. While 
some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) 
includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough 
to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder 
(LLDD), now known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the 
most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and 
perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment. Anyone who 
has ovaries can have PMDD, including transgender individuals. Currently, PMDD 
is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the 
criteria for diagnosis as follows: Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11 
symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: 1. 
Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts. 
2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge”. 3. Marked 
affective lability. 4. Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased 
interpersonal conflicts. 5. Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work, 
school, friends, and hobbies). 6. Subjective sense of difficulty in 
concentrating. 7. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy. 8. 
Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings. 9. Hypersomnia 
or insomnia. 10. A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control. 11. 
Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint 
or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B - symptoms 
severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or 
scholastic functioning. Criterion C - symptoms discretely related to the 
menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of 
another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic 
disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed 
on those of these disorders). Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C are confirmed 
by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual 
cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation. 
Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life 
detriments and work-productivity losses and incur greater healthcare costs than 
women with no or only mild symptoms.

Background and objective A high rate of preoperative anemia has been observed in 
patients undergoing knee and hip arthroplasty. The type of anesthesia that 
patients receive may play a role in preventing or minimizing adverse outcomes in 
these patients. In this study, we aimed to examine the complication rates in 
patients with severe anemia undergoing this surgery. In addition, we explore 
whether neuraxial anesthesia is associated with better outcomes compared to 
general anesthesia. Methods The American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) registry was used to extract data 
related to patients who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty from 2014 to 
2016. Only those patients with a hematocrit level <30% were included, and they 
were classified into two groups based on primary anesthesia type received: 
neuraxial versus general anesthesia. The primary outcome of interest was 
postoperative transfusion. Secondary outcomes included 30-day hospital 
readmission and postoperative complications. Multivariable logistic regression 
was used to model primary anesthesia type to outcomes while controlling for 
various confounders. The odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
were reported. Results There were 1,723 patients with severe anemia included in 
our analysis, of which 41.2% received neuraxial anesthesia. Among patients that 
received neuraxial versus general anesthesia, 170 (31.08%) and 486 (41.33%), 
respectively, received a postoperative blood transfusion (p<0.001). On 
multivariable regression analysis, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with 40% 
decreased odds of postoperative transfusion (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.51-0.79, 
p<0.0001), but it was not associated with any other outcomes. Conclusion 
Neuraxial anesthesia can reduce the risk of postoperative transfusion in 
severely anemic patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA), ultimately 
leading to reduced discomfort, hospital expenditure, and adverse outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Coexistence of temporomandibular joint discomfort along with 
cervical spine disorders is quite common, and is associated with many 
limitations and adverse symptoms for the patient. Both diagnostics and treatment 
of these ailments are difficult, and in many cases, the effects of therapy are 
not satisfactory. This study assessed the impact of a 3-week neck-only 
rehabilitation programme without direct intervention in the craniofacial area on 
the bioelectric activity of both the cervical spine and muscles in the 
craniofacial area among patients with idiopathic neck pain who do not report TMJ 
pain.
DESIGN: A parallel group trial with follow-up; Setting: Rehabilitation Clinic.
METHODS: Twenty five patients experiencing idiopathic neck pain underwent the 
3-week rehabilitation programme. Thirty five age-matched subjects with no 
cervical spine and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunctions were control 
group. At baseline and after 3 weeks the cervical and craniofacial area muscles' 
bioelectrical activity (sEMG) was evaluated.
RESULTS: In the experimental group during cervical flexion, a significant 
decrease of sEMG amplitude was noted in the right (mean 25.1 μV; 95% CI: 
21.5-28.6 vs mean 16.8 μV; 95% CI: 13.8-19.7) and left (mean 25.9 μV; 95% CI: 
21.7-30.0 vs mean 17.2 μV; 95% CI: 13.6-20.7) Sternocleidomastoid as well as a 
significant increase in sEMG amplitude of the right (mean 11.1 μV; 95% CI: 
7.9-14.2 vs mean 15.7 μV; 95% CI: 12.1-19.2) and left (mean 15.3 μV; 95% CI: 
11.9-18.6 vs mean 20.2 μV; 95% CI: 15.7-24.2) Upper Trapezius muscles. In the 
experimental group, after therapy right and left Sternocleidomastoid, Temporalis 
Anterior and Masseter muscles presented lower fatigue levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of rehabilitation without any therapeutic intervention 
in temporomandibular joint significantly decreased the bioelectrical activity of 
the neck and craniofacial muscles while improving the muscle pattern of 
coactivation in participants with idiopathic neck pain who do not report 
temporomandibular joint pain. These observations could be helpful in the 
physiotherapeutic treatment of neck and craniofacial area dysfunctions.

BACKGROUND: Implant cut-out or cut-through remains a common cause of 
cephalomedullary nail failure and patient morbidity following surgical treatment 
of intertrochanteric femur fractures. In patients not suitable for conversion to 
total hip arthroplasty, which can involve long operation times and substantial 
blood loss, as well as a higher risk of periprosthetic fracture and dislocation 
postoperatively, revision with another internal fixation is an alternative 
option. If the femoral head can be preserved as much as possible to avoid 
eventual joint replacement while the internal fixation failure is solved, the 
quality of life of patients will be significantly improved.
CASE PRESENTATION: This current case describes a successful clinical use of a 
salvage procedure that allows the surgeon to avoid joint arthroplasty using 
INTERTAN to solve internal fixation failure caused by cut-through of Proximal 
Femoral Nail Antirotation-II (PFNA-II). Four years after closed reduction and 
internal fixation of the right femur, the patient had immobilizing right hip 
pain and mobility disorder. X-ray examination revealed contraction of the neck 
of the right femur and cut-through of the helical blade of the PFNA-II. After 
the revision operation, he recovered well and presented no grown pain or 
discomfort in weight-bearing. Conventional radiographs at 1-year follow-up 
showed a healed fracture, with no implant migration.
CONCLUSION: Main nail exchange and revision with INTERTAN can be considered a 
salvage procedure in selected cases to revise a failed fixation with PFNA, which 
solves internal fixation failure as well as preserves the femoral head.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the acute effects of an upper 
limb static-stretching (SS) protocol on the maximal concentric jump performance. 
We recruited 25 young healthy, male, resistance trained individuals (stretched 
group, n = 15 and control group, n = 10) in this study. The randomized between 
group experimental protocol consisted of a three trials of maximal concentric 
jump task, before and after a SS of the upper limb. Vertical ground reaction 
forces (vGRF) and surface electromyography (sEMG) of both gastrocnemius 
lateralis (GL) and vastus lateralis (VL) were acquired. An extensive SS was 
employed consisting of ten stretches of 30 seconds, with 15 seconds of rest, and 
70-90% of the point of discomfort (POD). ANOVA (2x2) (group x condition) was 
used for shoulder joint range of motion (ROM), vGRF and sEMG. A significant 
interaction for passive ROM of the shoulder joint revealed significant increases 
between pre- and post-SS protocol (p < 0.001). A significant interaction 
demonstrated decreased peak force and an increased peak propulsion duration 
between pre- and post-stretching only for stretch group (p = 0.021, and p = 
0.024, respectively. There was a significant main effect between groups (stretch 
and control) for peak force for control group (p = 0.045). Regarding sEMG 
variables, there were no significant differences between groups (control versus 
stretched) or condition (pre-stretching versus post-stretching) for the peak 
amplitude of RMS and IEMG for both muscles (VL and GL). In conclusion, an acute 
extensive SS can increase the shoulder ROM, and negatively affect both the 
propulsion duration and peak force of the maximal concentric jump, without 
providing significant changes in muscle activation. Key pointsThe jump 
performance can be affected negatively by an intense extensive static-stretching 
protocol.An intense acute extensive SS protocol can affect positively the 
shoulder ROM.The intense acute extensive SS protocol does not change the level 
of muscle activation for vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius lateralis.

BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) provides a promising 
approach to counteract muscle impairment in hip and knee osteoarthritis, and to 
expedite recovery from joint replacement surgery. Nonetheless, application into 
clinical orthopaedic practice remains limited, partly due to concerns regarding 
patient tolerance.
OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to quantify levels of adherence to NMES 
interventions for muscle impairment in hip and knee osteoarthritis and identify 
strategies to increase compliance.
DATA SOURCES: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in a web-based 
literature review, completed in December 2020. The databases sourced included 
the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Complete, Medline Complete and PubMed.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were: (i) conducted in 
cohorts of adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis; (ii) a protocol of electrical 
muscle stimulation prescribed to treat muscle impairment; and (iii) reported 
intervention adherence or attrition rate. Data were extracted on adherence rate, 
reasons for non-adherence and potential strategies to increase adherence. Risk 
of bias was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.
RESULTS: The search yielded 120 articles, of which 15 studies were considered 
eligible and included in the analysis (n = 922). All NMES treatment was applied 
to the quadriceps, with 1 study targeting the quadriceps and calves. The mean 
PEDRO score of the included studies was 6.80 out of a possible 10 (range 6-8). 
Mean adherence did not differ between groups receiving treatment with NMES 
(85% ± 12%) and control groups receiving voluntary exercise or education 
(84% ± 9%) (P = .97). Reasons for non-adherence or attrition included a dislike 
of the device, dizziness, pain and discomfort. Strategies to increase adherence 
included NMES education, a familiarisation period, supervision, setting 
thresholds based upon patient tolerance, monitoring pain levels during 
stimulation and using built-in adherence trackers.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that adherence to NMES 
interventions for muscle impairment in hip and knee osteoarthritis in clinical 
trials does not differ to control groups receiving education or voluntary 
exercise, and hence should not be a barrier to application in clinical practice.

What's Tramadol Got to Do with It? A Case Report of Rebound Hypoglycemia, a 
Reappraisal and Review of Potential Mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Tramadol has gained traction as an analgesic of choice among pain 
practicing physicians. However some concerns regarding a previously unlabeled 
adverse reaction - hypoglycemia - have cast it in a dim light. Prior reports 
have noted an associated risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia after tramadol 
use, but whether tramadol is the main causal agent is poorly understood and the 
underlying mechanisms are not well delineated. We present a unique case of 
rebound hypoglycemia as a variation of the theme of tramadol's adverse effect 
profile in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and reappraise potential 
mechanisms underlying this underappreciated phenomenon.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman presented with right buttock pain and 
right lateral leg discomfort of 9-month duration. Her physical exam suggested 
sacroiliac joint (SIJ) etiology, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
She was scheduled for an SIJ-diagnostic and therapeutic block and started on 
tramadol 50 mg 3 times daily on as needed basis. The patient subsequently 
developed severe hypoglycemia initially resistant to euglycemia restorative 
interventions with a rebound episode. Hypoglycemia resolved with oral ingestion 
of high levels of glucose and the patient was taken off tramadol. Fortunately, 
she did not require hospitalization.
DISCUSSION: The clinical scenario described is a case of rebound hypoglycemia 
after tramadol use in a patient with type-1 diabetes naïve to opioid analgesics. 
The episodes of hypoglycemia aligned perfectly with the anticipated 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of tramadol. The specificity and 
temporality of events after tramadol use in this patient fulfilled causality 
criteria. Tramadol may cause rebound hypoglycemia in patients via interference 
of the intrinsic euglycemia-restoration pathways and a blunted autonomic 
counter-regulatory response to antecedent hypoglycemia. Its use must be tempered 
by this underappreciated adverse effect profile.Key words: Tramadol, 
hypoglycemia, sacroiliac joint arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, serotonin 
uptake inhibitors, glutamate receptor 4.

Introduction  Oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) represents a part of 
the general health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This OHRQoL indicates 
someone's subjective knowledge of a patient's oral health status, which is 
mostly associated with physical conditions and general HRQoL issues. A report by 
the World Health Organization labeled rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases as 
the second most reported cause of disability worldwide. Considering their 
potential influence on the masticatory system, rheumatic diseases (RDs) can 
significantly affect oral health and the quality of life. Objective This study 
aimed to evaluate the impact of RDs on OHRQoL, including oral complaints, oral 
habits, oral functions, and dental care. Materials and methods This 
cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted in multi-governmental medical 
and dental institutions in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The research was approved by 
the ethics committee Institutional Review Board (IRB). The validated surveys 
were distributed to the subjects manually. Data were analyzed using Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 23.0 software, and all parameters were 
expressed in frequencies and percentages. Results The study included 108 
patients: 10 males (9.3%) and 98 (90.7%) females. Approximately 81% of the study 
group reported occasional changes in the quality of life caused by oral or 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems. Dental caries and periodontal diseases 
were the most commonly reported complaints (73.1%). Regarding oral 
manifestations of RDs affecting the quality of life, 91.7% of participants never 
experienced difficulty speaking and taste changes; pain and discomfort in the 
mouth were always present in 4.6% of the participants. Conclusion Patients with 
RDs exhibited reduced OHRQoL, with several differences between the entities. 
Specifically, OHRQoL decreased in diseases with more oral manifestations, such 
as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which 
showed a high percentage in this study (SLE, about 27.8%; RA, 62%).

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: This case report describes the reconstruction of 
the traumatic distal fibular and lateral malleolus defects with a novel method 
of using individualized 3D printed titanium prosthesis for the first time.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old male farmer was hospitalized in emergency 
because of open injury and distal fibular and lateral malleolus defects in the 
left leg caused by a car accident. 3 months after debridement and latissimus 
dorsi muscle flap transplantation and skin graft operation, the patient 
re-hospitalized because of distal fibular and lateral malleolus defect and local 
pain. We examined the bilateral ankle joint with three-dimensional CT, obtained 
data about the missing left distal fibular and lateral malleolus through the 
mirror principle. The corresponding titanium alloy prosthesis then was designed 
and printed using a 3D metal printer. The patient had no obvious 
contraindication for surgery, so the prosthesis was surgically implanted. The 
patient was followed up for 2 years. There was no discomfort at the surgical 
site. The function of the operated ankle was satisfied by the patient, the AOFAS 
(American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) score was 85 (Kitaoka et al., 1994 
[1]).
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Individualized 3D printed titanium alloy prosthesis 
consistent with the anatomical structure of lost distal fibula and lateral 
malleolus. The proximal end of the prosthesis was designed with four nail holes 
to install screws to fix the fibula together with it. The lower tibiofibular and 
talofibular joint surfaces of the prosthesis were designed smoothly. In order to 
improve the stability of the lower tibiofibular joint, anchors were placed at 
the attachment of the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments to 
reconstruct these ligaments.
CONCLUSION: The structure and function of the reconstructed distal fibular and 
the lateral malleous were close to normal. Individualized 3D printed prosthesis 
might have considerable advantages over traditional treatment methods. The 
individualized 3D printed titanium alloy prosthesis provides a new method for 
the repair and reconstruction of similar bone defects. The use of 3D printed 
prosthesis for surgical repair needs to be further examined in the future 
through long-term follow-up studies and in more cases.

Synergistic Effects of a Mixture of Glycosaminoglycans to Inhibit Adipogenesis 
and Enhance Chondrocyte Features in Multipotent Cells.

Petrov PD, Granados N, Chetrit C, Martínez-Puig D, Palou A, Bonet ML.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells affect homeostasis of 
adipose and joint tissues. Factors influencing their differentiation fate are of 
interest for both obesity and joint problems. We studied the impact of a mixture 
of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (hyaluronic acid: dermatan sulfate 1:0.25, w/w) 
used in an oral supplement for joint discomfort (Oralvisc™) on the 
differentiation fate of multipotent cells.
METHODS: Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were used as a model system. 
Post-confluent monolayer MEF cultures non-stimulated or hormonally stimulated to 
adipogenesis were chronically exposed to the GAGs mixture, its individual 
components or vehicle. The appearance of lipid laden cells, lipid accumulation 
and expression of selected genes at the mRNA and protein level was assessed.
RESULTS: Exposure to the GAGs mixture synergistically suppressed spontaneous 
adipogenesis and induced the expression of cartilage extracellular matrix 
proteins, aggrecan core protein, decorin and cartilage oligomeric matrix 
protein. Hormonally-induced adipogenesis in the presence of the GAGs mixture 
resulted in decreased adipogenic differentiation, down-regulation of 
adipogenic/lipogenic factors and genes for insulin resistance-related adipokines 
(resistin and retinol binding protein 4), and up-regulation of oxidative 
metabolism-related genes. Adipogenesis in the presence of dermatan sulfate, the 
minor component of the mixture, was not impaired but resulted in smaller lipid 
droplets and the induction of a more complete brown adipocyte-related 
transcriptional program in the cells in the adipose state.
CONCLUSIONS: The Oralvisc™ GAGs mixture can tip the adipogenic/chondrogenic fate 
balance of multipotent cells away from adipogenesis while favoring chondrocyte 
related gene expression. The mixture and its dermatan sulfate component also 
have modulatory effects of interest on hormonally-induced adipogenesis and on 
metabolic and secretory capabilities of adipose cells.

INTRODUCTION: After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery, returning 
the knee to previous levels of strength and function is challenging, with the 
failure to do so associated with an increased risk of reinjury and long-term 
degenerative problems. Blood flow restriction (BFR) is gaining popularity as a 
rehabilitation technique; however, its effects on the mechanics of these 
exercises have not been fully explored. In this study, we aimed to determine the 
acute effects of BFR on the performance of a step-up exercise protocol and to 
assess the acceptability of the technique.
METHODS: Twenty individuals (12 female/8 male; mean age, 30.6 yr) who had 
recently undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and 20 controls (11 
female/9 male, mean age 28.0 yr) performed a step-up exercise protocol with and 
without BFR. Lower limb kinematics and kinetics were measured and compared 
between groups and conditions. Testing was completed in June 2019.
RESULTS: Participants in both groups had increased external rotation of the 
tibia of 2° (P < 0.001) and reductions in knee flexion and rotation torques 
around the joint of around 50% (P < 0.001) when using BFR compared with 
nonrestricted step-up exercise. The intervention was found to increase the 
difficulty of the exercise and induce moderate levels of discomfort (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The present study provides cautious support for the use of BFR, 
showing that there are minimal changes in knee joint mechanics when performing 
the same exercise without BFR, and that the changes do not increase joint 
torques at the knee. From an acute biomechanical perspective, the intervention 
appears safe to use under qualified supervision; however, effects of repetitive 
use and long-term outcomes should be monitored.

AIMS: This study describes the Osseointegration Group of Australia's Accelerated 
Protocol two-stage strategy (OGAAP-1) for the osseointegrated reconstruction of 
amputated limbs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report clinical outcomes in 50 unilateral trans-femoral 
amputees with a mean age of 49.4 years (24 to 73), with a minimum one-year 
follow-up. Outcome measures included the Questionnaire for persons with a 
Trans-Femoral Amputation, the health assessment questionnaire Short-Form-36 
Health Survey, the Amputation Mobility Predictor scores presented as K-levels, 6 
Minute Walk Test and timed up and go tests. Adverse events included soft-tissue 
problems, infection, fractures and failure of the implant.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all 
five outcome measures. A total of 27 patients experienced adverse events but at 
the conclusion of the study, all 50 were walking on osseointegrated prostheses.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that osseointegrated prostheses are a 
suitable alternative to socket-fit devices for amputees experiencing 
socket-related discomfort and that our strategy offers more rapid progress to 
walking than other similar protocols. Cite this article: Bone Joint J

Osteoarthritis, a prevalent long-term condition of the joints, primarily impacts 
older individuals, resulting in discomfort, restrictions in mobility, and a 
decrease in overall well-being. Although Osteoarthritis is widely spread, there 
is a lack of successful interventions to stop the advancement of the condition. 
Numerous signaling pathways have been emphasized in recent research on 
Osteoarthritis, yet the diagnostic significance of numerous genes has not been 
investigated. To identify genes that were expressed differently in 
osteoarthritis, we utilized the Gene Expression Omnibus database. To identify 
marker genes, we built machine learning models including Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Random Forest. We categorized 
Osteoarthritis samples and performed immune cell infiltration analysis based on 
the expression patterns of these characteristic genes. Both the Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Random Forest models selected six marker 
genes (TOX3, ARG1, CST7, RERGL, COL11A1, NCRNA00185) out of a total of 17 
differentially expressed genes. The osteoarthritis samples were categorized into 
two groups, namely a high expression group and a low expression group, based on 
the median levels of TOX3 expression. Comparative analysis of these groups 
identified 85 differentially expressed genes, showing notable enrichment in 
pathways related to lipid metabolism in the group with high expression. Analysis 
of immune cell infiltration revealed noticeable differences in immune profiles 
among the two groups. The group with high expression of TOX3 showed a notable 
increase in Mast cells and Type II IFN Response, whereas B cells, Cytolytic 
activity, Inflammation-promoting cells, NK cells, pDCs, T cell co-inhibition, 
Th1 cells, and Th2 cells were significantly decreased. We constructed a ceRNA 
network for TOX3, revealing 57 lncRNAs and 18 miRNAs involved in 57 lncRNA-miRNA 
interactions, and 18 miRNA-mRNA interactions with TOX3. Validation of TOX3 
expression was confirmed using an external dataset (GSE29746), revealing a 
notable increase in Osteoarthritis samples. In conclusion, our study presents a 
comprehensive analysis identifying TOX3 as a potential feature gene in 
Osteoarthritis. The distinct immune profiles and involvement in fat metabolism 
pathways associated with TOX3 expression suggest its significance in 
Osteoarthritis pathogenesis. The study establishes a basis for comprehending the 
intricate correlation between characteristic genes and Osteoarthritis, as well 
as for the formulation of individualized therapeutic approaches.

The pectoralis minor (PMn) muscle originates from the third, fourth, and fifth 
ribs near the costochondral junctionusually and gets inserted on the medial 
margin and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula. To look at the 
morphological insertion patterns and sites of attachment of the PMn muscle in 
the donated cadavers. Over all 19 limbs were included in the study (9 right and 
10 left). Out of 19 limbs, 10 belonged to female and 9 belonged to male 
cadavers. The cadavers were meticulously dissected to determine the 
morphological insertion types and location of the attachment of the muscle. 
Unusual pattern of insertion was observed in 6 limbs (31.6%) out of total 19 
limbs included in the study. The variations we observed does not fall completely 
in the classification by Le Double, hence variations we observed can be 
considered as new and rare variant which to our knowledge is not reported in 
literature. We propose this new variant to be type 4 of Le Double 
classification. The potential of ectopic PMn tendon should be taken into 
consideration and tested out, especially in patients with shoulder discomfort 
and stiffening who have ruled out the more frequent diseases. For proper 
surgical planning, a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging or USG examination 
of the shoulder joint is required considering the prevalence of variation in the 
insertion pattern of PMn muscle. Preoperative identification of any abnormal PMn 
insertion can help to reduce the risk of iatrogenic tendon injury and 
post-operative problems.

BACKGROUND: Bicipital tendinitis and/or tendinopathy is a common cause of 
forelimb lameness in dogs, particularly in larger and more active patients. 
Although conservative treatment aimed at resolving discomfort and preserving the 
tendon remains the primary therapeutic goal, in certain cases it is necessary to 
surgically transect the tendon to eliminate pain and lameness. Transection of 
the tendon can be performed by open arthrotomy, arthroscopically, or 
percutaneously using a scalpel blade. This paper examines the utility of a 
modified percutaneous approach using a hypodermic needle in place of a scalpel 
blade, under ultrasound-guided assistance.
AIM: To develop and describe a surgical technique for performing a percutaneous 
biceps tenotomy using a hypodermic needle under ultrasound guidance.
METHOD: The technique was piloted using the shoulders of 12 cadaver dogs 
initially and once developed, then applied to another 12 cadavers. The final 
procedure was performed on a total of 22 shoulders. Assessments were recorded on 
time to complete the procedure, completeness of bicipital tendon transection, 
and presence of any iatrogenic damage to associated joint structures.
RESULTS: Procedure time averaged fewer than 2 minutes. Complete transection was 
achieved in 20 out of 22 of the shoulders, with evidence of incomplete 
transection discernable by ultrasound imaging in the remaining two shoulders. 
One cadaver shoulder experienced iatrogenic damage secondary to incorrect 
hypodermic needle angulation.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous biceps tenotomy using a hypodermic needle is an 
efficient and straightforward procedure. The lack of a surgical incision makes 
it the least invasive technique devised so far. Ultrasound imaging allows the 
practitioner to assess the completeness of the transection increasing precision.

A personalized pelvis and femur shape is required to build a finite element 
buttock thigh model when experimentally investigating seating discomfort. The 
present study estimates the shape of pelvis and femur using a principal 
component analysis (PCA) based method with a limited number of palpable 
anatomical landmarks (ALs) as predictors. A leave-one-out experiment was 
designed using 38 pelvises and femurs from a same sample of adult specimens. As 
expected, prediction errors decrease with the number of ALs. Using the maximum 
number of easily palpable ALs (13 for pelvis and 4 for femur), average errors 
were 5.4 and 4.8 mm respectively for pelvis and femur. Better prediction was 
obtained when the shapes of pelvis and femur were predicted separately without 
merging the data of both bones. Results also show that the PCA based method is a 
good alternative to predict hip and lumbosacral joint centers with an average 
error of 5.0 and 9.2 mm respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and construct validity of the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) technique for measuring health care preferences in 
families of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Parents were asked to estimate the monthly US dollar amount they would 
be willing to pay to obtain for their child the following hypothetical drugs: 
ARTHRO, which guarantees complete clinical response; and NO-STOM-ACHE, a drug 
that eliminates gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. A yes/no question was used with 
random assignment of the starting bids. Parents who agreed to pay the starting 
bid were then asked whether they would be willing to pay 200% and then 400% of 
this initial bid. Socioeconomic data and information on medications, disease 
activity, patient physical function, wellbeing, and health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) were obtained.
RESULTS: Sixty-two families of children with JIA were interviewed. GI symptoms 
were present in 54%, and 53% of the children had joints with active arthritis or 
limited range of motion. Four parents (7%) were unwilling to pay anything for 
any of the studied medications. The mean amount (median; mean percentage of 
available family income) families were willing to pay was $395 ($300; 15%) for 
ARTHRO and $109 ($80; 4%) for NO-STOM-ACHE. Correlation and regression analysis 
supported that, adjusted for the available family income, the WTP for ARTHRO was 
associated with disease activity, pain, and the HRQOL of the patients. After 
correction for the starting bids and the available family income, the WTP for 
NO-STOM-ACHE was associated with the patient's HRQOL, pain, and the amount of GI 
discomfort.
CONCLUSION: The WTP technique is feasible and has construct validity for 
measuring health care preferences for children with JIA. Relatively large WTP 
estimates support a possible important negative impact of the disease on 
families of children with JIA.

BACKGROUND: Care of the child after hip-spica application is the most 
challenging issue faced by parents. Reduced mobility and recumbency can cause 
respiratory problems, skin irritation and discomfort for the child. Parents need 
to lift the child in a spica to make him upright and to mobilize. To improve the 
comfort of the family in post spica care, we have designed a 'Hip Spica 
Stroller' which is low profile, comfortable, easy to construct and relatively 
inexpensive. This manuscript discusses our early experience with this hip-spica 
stroller use.
METHODS: A sturdy, relatively lightweight and portable stroller was designed in 
collaboration with local mechanical engineering team. The stroller allowed safe 
upright placement of the child with spica and their easy mobility. From the 
second post-operative day, children were mobilised in the stroller. We looked 
for development of any complications related to the stroller such as spica 
breakage, skin irritation or excoriation development. Parents were also inquired 
about their feedback and satisfaction with the device upon spica removal.
RESULTS: We used the spica stroller in nine patients after Developmental 
Dysplasia Hip (DDH) treatment and in eight patients post shaft femur fracture 
treatment. None of the patients experienced any stroller-related complications. 
All the patients maintained the joint reduction and the fractured bone fragment 
alignment. High satisfaction rates were reported by parents.
CONCLUSION: Hip Spica Stroller is an innovative and easy-to-make device which 
would enhance the post spica care. It can aid alleviating the fear of parents 
for their child's hip-spica treatment.

BACKGROUND: Snapping triceps syndrome (STS) is a rare disease, while occurrence 
of bilateral STS is extremely rare. It is usually accompanied by dislocation of 
the ulnar nerve and double snapping is a clinically important feature. However, 
to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of bilateral STS in young 
active patient.
CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old male presented with a complaint of discomfort and 
snapping on the medial side of both elbows while performing push-ups. On 
physical examination, two distinct snaps that were both palpable and audible 
were detected on additional clinical examination. Dynamic ultrasonography showed 
that the ulnar nerve and the medial head of the triceps were dislocated 
anteriorly over the medial epicondyle of the elbow during flexion motion. 
Finally, he was diagnosed as dislocation of the ulnar nerve and STS. Staged 
anterior subcutaneous transposition of the ulnar nerve combined with partial 
resection of the snapping portion of the triceps was performed. The patient's 
pain and snapping symptoms were resolved immediately after surgery. Three months 
later, the patient was completely asymptomatic and returned to normal activity.
CONCLUSION: STS should be included in the differential diagnosis for active 
young patients who present with painful snapping on the medial side of the elbow 
joint, particularly when dislocation of the ulnar nerve is detected. Dynamic 
sonography is used to assist in accurate diagnosis and differentiation between 
isolated dislocation of the ulnar nerve and STS.

BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism can cause a variety of manifestations, including 
cardiovascular disorders. The most frequent clinical signs are sinus bradycardia 
and pericardial effusion. The affected patient generally has significant 
symptoms. Hypothyroidism infrequently results in a complete atrioventricular 
block.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old girl presented to our cardiology clinic with 
generalized tiredness, edema in her lower limbs and face, constipation, and a 
menstruation abnormality in the previous six months. With a normal ejection 
fraction on echocardiography, an electrocardiogram revealed complete 
atrioventricular block. When she was admitted, her laboratory testing showed 
that she had severely raised Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels, severe 
dyslipidemia with normal electrolytes, and normal liver and kidney function 
tests. The patient was treated with 50mg Thyroxine to her. She had significant 
improvement within two weeks of treatment. Up on the next follow-up (at 
one-month), her electrocardiogram returned to normal sinus rhythm without any 
evidence of atrioventricular block and that the lipid profile had returned to 
normal.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: In its first stages, hypothyroidism can not show any 
obvious symptoms. Untreated hypothyroidism over time can lead to a variety of 
health issues, including obesity, joint discomfort, infertility, and heart 
disease. This current case demonstrates how levothyroxine medication 
successfully managed a young female patient's severe hypothyroidism, difficult 
total heart block, severe hyperlipidemia, and long-standing menstrual 
irregularity.
CONCLUSION: We found that overt hypothyroidism caused a complete 
atrioventricular block and severe dyslipidemia, and that thyroxin therapy 
completely corrected both conditions.

The safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in patients undergoing 
dual-chamber pacemaker (Medtronic's EnRhythm MRI SureScan IPG (implantable pulse 
generator) and CapSureFix MRI pacing electrodes) implantation were evaluated. A 
total of 86 patients undergoing this pacemaker implantation who were admitted to 
Huanggang Hospital from June 2006 to March 2017 were continuously selected. On 
average 6.8±2.3 months after the implantation, the first MRI scan was conducted. 
The mean scan time was 2.2±0.9 and mean duration was 45.6±12.3 min; mean 
follow-up visit period was 40.5±15.6 months, and after follow-up, all the 
abnormal symptoms of patients and pacemaker abnormalities after scans were 
recorded. Causes of receiving MRI scans included neurological diseases (27%), 
spinal diseases (14%), cancers (26%), joint injuries (25%) and visceral systems 
(8%). A total of 12 cases (14.0%) showed significant discomfort symptoms, 10 
cases (11.6%) showed pacemaker abnormalities, and the incidence rate was 25.6%. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the basic types of 
cardiovascular diseases, dependence on pacemakers, duration of education, pacing 
threshold, impedance and MRI scan time were related to the occurrence of adverse 
scan results (p<0.05). In conclusion, MRI scans show that MRI-compatible 
dual-chamber pacemaker was relatively safe.

The loss of a hand can greatly affect quality of life. A prosthetic device that 
can mimic normal hand function is very important to physical and mental 
recuperation after hand amputation, but the currently available prosthetics do 
not fully meet the needs of the amputee community. Most prosthetic hands are not 
dexterous enough to grasp a variety of shaped objects, and those that are tend 
to be heavy, leading to discomfort while wearing the device. In order to attempt 
to better simulate human hand function, a dexterous hand was developed that uses 
an over-actuated mechanism to form grasp shape using intrinsic joint mounted 
motors in addition to a finger tendon to produce large flexion force for a tight 
grip. This novel actuation method allows the hand to use small actuators for 
grip shape formation, and the tendon to produce high grip strength. The hand was 
capable of producing fingertip flexion force suitable for most activities of 
daily living. In addition, it was able to produce a range of grasp shapes with 
natural, independent finger motion, and appearance similar to that of a human 
hand. The hand also had a mass distribution more similar to a natural forearm 
and hand compared to contemporary prosthetics due to the more proximal location 
of the heavier components of the system. This paper describes the design of the 
hand and controller, as well as the test results.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Hallux rigidus (HR) is a degenerative arthritis 
affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP), leading to pain and 
functional impairment, particularly during the propulsive phase of walking. The 
prevalence of HR is about 2.5 % in individuals over 50, but younger individuals 
can also be affected, as demonstrated in this case.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 26-year-old patient with a body mass 
index (BMI) of 20.2, who has been suffering from HR for 5 years. The patient 
presented with walking difficulties, characterized by a limp and impaired 
propulsion phase, and pain in the right foot due to HR. A comprehensive gait 
assessment was conducted using a baropodometric platform and integrated 
smartphone motion sensors. Following the diagnosis, a non-surgical intervention 
involving the application of a compressed cotton felt foot orthosis at the MTP 
plantar area was initiated. This intervention aimed to alleviate pain and 
improve the functional mobility of the right big toe. Post-treatment assessments 
showed an increase in the big toe's mobility from 0 degrees to 35 degrees, as 
measured by a digital goniometer.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The application of a soft support, such as compressed 
cotton felt, at the plantar area of MTP, demonstrated a potential non-surgical 
therapeutic approach to improve gait and reduce discomfort in HR patients.
CONCLUSION: This case study underscores the potential benefits of plantar 
modification in the management of HR.

INTRODUCTION: It is well known that foot massage is a very prevalent stress 
relief method in China. Literatures have reported various massage-inducted 
peripheral nerve injuries. However, massage-inducted lateral plantar nerve (LPN) 
injury is very rare. Here, we represent an unusual case of massage-inducted LPN 
damage, and we also report the diagnostic method of this patient using 
musculoskeletal ultrasonography combined with electromyography (EMG).
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 21-year-old woman presented symptoms of redness, swelling, 
pain and numbness in the medial right ankle joint for 2 days.
DIAGNOSIS: The results of musculoskeletal ultrasonography and EMG provide great 
help for doctors to make accurate diagnosis. The patient was eventually 
diagnosed with LPN injury.
INTERVENTIONS: No further foot massage was allowed. Vitamin B12 was taken orally 
for 2 months. Conservative therapy, including electrical stimulation therapy and 
infrared therapy, was conducted. Besides, active rehabilitation training was 
also performed.
OUTCOMES: The discomfort symptoms were relieved significantly after 2 months 
conservative treatment. Clinical symptoms and EMG examination illustrated 
satisfactory result during follow up time.
CONCLUSION: The report showed that the masseur should be very careful when doing 
foot massage to prevent nerve damage. Besides, musculoskeletal ultrasonography 
combined with EMG can provide important evidence for accurate and effective 
diagnosis of LPN injury.

INTRODUCTION: Fibroma is a benign tumor. More than 99% fibroma arises from 
tendon sheaths or tendons. Aggressive Fibroma at posterior compartment knee is a 
rare case. This report presents one case of fibroma at posterior compartment of 
the knee with the treatment.
CASE REPORT: A boy with 4-year history of knee discomfort and lump at posterior 
knee joint, no history of infection and trauma. Physical examination revealed a 
mass (10 × 9 × 7 cm) with limited Range of Motion extension 30°, flexion 70°. 
MRI revealed a soft tissue mass at posterior knee compartment. Histologic 
examination showed a circumscribed and lobulated hypo cellular mass containing 
spindle cells diagnosed as aggressive fibroma. The patient underwent popliteal 
resection. An ellipse incision was made 2 cm margin of skin around the biopsy 
site. Fasciocutaneous flaps were created and retracted to expose the posterior 
compartment. The tumor had a partial well-defined capsule, popliteal artery and 
vein embedded and pressing the sciatic nerve. The tumor and enveloping muscles 
were elevated from the base of the compartment. The sciatic nerve was preserved 
with epineurotomy. The popliteal artery was reconstructed with saphenous veins 
graft. After the tumor was resected, the heads of gastrocnemius were sutured to 
each other and to the hamstring muscles to cover popliteal space. After one year 
postoperative, there was a good vascularization, no recurrence and neurological 
deficit with Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Scoring System 80%.
CONCLUSION: One year postoperative with popliteal resection surgery yields a 
good result. A follow-up is needed for risk of recurrence and malignancy.

RATIONALE: Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of foot pain presenting with 
morning stiffness and plantar area pain. This case study is to optimize the 
management in patient with plantar fasciitis accompanied by apparent high-arch 
foot.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old women presented with plantar fasciitis 
accompanied by apparent high-arch foot. The pain presents for the heel and 
pelvic areas with long-distance walking.
DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis accompanied by apparent 
high-arch foot for physical examination and plain radiographs. In muscle 
performance and dynamic postural stability tests, indicated the muscle weakness 
and postural instability.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with manual therapy such as joint and 
soft tissue mobilization interventions including plantar fascia and 
gastrocnemius stretching, but the heel and pelvic pain were aggravated during 
long-distance walking. After hip strengthening exercises, the heel and pelvic 
pain significantly improved.
OUTCOMES: The 3-month follow-up revealed that the heel and pelvic pain did not 
occur in the long-distance walking, and there was no pain and discomfort at one 
year follow-up.
LESSONS: To optimize the management in patient with plantar fasciitis 
accompanied by apparent high-arch deformity, clinicians should try to identify 
the hip abductor muscles weakness, and therapists should consider incorporating 
hip strengthening exercises.

Calculation of Resistive Loads for Elastic Resistive Exercises.

Picha K, Uhl T.

CONTEXT: What is the correct resistive load to start resistive training with 
elastic resistance to gain strength? This question is typically answered by the 
clinician's best estimate and patient's level of discomfort without objective 
evidence.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the average level of resistance to initiate a 
strengthening routine with elastic resistance following isometric strength 
testing.
DESIGN: Cohort.
SETTING: Clinical.
PARTICIPANTS: 34 subjects (31 ± 13 y, 73 ± 17 kg, 170 ± 12 cm).
INTERVENTIONS: The force produced was measured in Newtons (N) with an isometric 
dynamometer. The force distance was the distance from center of joint to 
location of force applied was measured in meters to calculate torque that was 
called "Test Torque" for the purposes of this report. This torque data was 
converted to "Exercise Load" in pounds based on the location where the 
resistance was applied, specifically the distance away from the center of 
rotation of the exercising limb. The average amount of exercise load as 
percentage of initial Test Torque for each individual for each exercise was 
recorded to determine what the average level of resistance that could be used 
for elastic resistance strengthening program.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of initial test torque calculated for the 
exercise was recorded for each exercise and torque produced was normalized to 
body weight.
RESULTS: The average percentage of maximal isometric force that was used to 
initiate exercises was 30 ± 7% of test torque.
CONCLUSIONS: This provides clinicians with an objective target load to start 
elastic resistance training. Individual variations will occur but utilization of 
a load cell during elastic resistance provides objective documentation of 
exercise progression.

OBJECTIVES: Surgeons become uncomfortable while performing surgery because heat 
transfer and evaporative cooling are restricted by insulating surgical gowns. 
Consequently, perceptions of thermal discomfort during surgery may impair 
cognitive performance. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate surgeons' thermal 
comfort, cognitive performance, core and mean skin temperatures, perceptions of 
sweat-soaked clothing, fatigue and exertion with and without a CoolSource 
cooling vest (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio, USA).
METHODS: Thirty orthopaedic surgeons participated in a randomised cross-over 
trial, each performing four total-joint arthroplasties with randomisation to one 
of four treatment sequences. The effects of cooling versus no cooling were 
measured using a repeated-measures linear model accounting for within-subject 
correlations.
RESULTS: The cooling vest improved thermal comfort by a mean (95% CI) of -2.1 
(-2.7 to -1.6) points on a 0-10 scale, p<0.001, with no evidence of 
treatment-by-period interaction (p=0.94). In contrast, cooling had no 
perceptible effect on cognition, with an estimated mean difference (95% CI) in 
Cleveland Clinic Cognitive Battery (C3B) Processing Speed Test score of 0.03 
(95% CI -2.44 to 2.51), p=0.98, or in C3B Visual Memory Test score with 
difference of 0.88 (95% CI -2.25 to 4.01), p=0.57. Core temperature was not 
lower with the cooling vest, with mean difference (95% CI) of -0.13 (-0.33°C to 
0.07°C), p=0.19, while mean skin temperature was lower, with mean difference of 
-0.23 (95% CI -0.40°C to -0.06°C) lower, p=0.011. The cooling vest significantly 
reduced surgeons' perceptions of sweat-soaked clothing, fatigue and exertion.
CONCLUSIONS: A cooling vest worn during surgery lowered core and skin 
temperatures, improved thermal comfort, and decreased perceptions of sweating 
and fatigue, but did not improve cognition. Thermal discomfort during major 
orthopaedic surgery is thus largely preventable, but cooling does not affect 
cognition.

The practicability of deep learning techniques has been demonstrated by their 
successful implementation in varied fields, including diagnostic imaging for 
clinicians. In accordance with the increasing demands in the healthcare 
industry, techniques for automatic prediction and detection are being widely 
researched. Particularly in dentistry, for various reasons, automated mandibular 
canal detection has become highly desirable. The positioning of the inferior 
alveolar nerve (IAN), which is one of the major structures in the mandible, is 
crucial to prevent nerve injury during surgical procedures. However, automatic 
segmentation using Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) poses certain 
difficulties, such as the complex appearance of the human skull, limited number 
of datasets, unclear edges, and noisy images. Using work-in-progress automation 
software, experiments were conducted with models based on 2D SegNet, 2D and 3D 
U-Nets as preliminary research for a dental segmentation automation tool. The 2D 
U-Net with adjacent images demonstrates higher global accuracy of 0.82 than 
naïve U-Net variants. The 2D SegNet showed the second highest global accuracy of 
0.96, and the 3D U-Net showed the best global accuracy of 0.99. The automated 
canal detection system through deep learning will contribute significantly to 
efficient treatment planning and to reducing patients' discomfort by a dentist. 
This study will be a preliminary report and an opportunity to explore the 
application of deep learning to other dental fields.

BACKGROUND: Co-morbidity is a powerful predictor of health care outcomes and 
costs, as well as an important cofounder in epidemiologic studies. The effect of 
co-morbidities is generally related to mortality or complications. This study 
evaluated the association between co-morbidity and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) in patients awaiting total joint replacement.
METHODS: A total of 893 patients were recruited to the study between August 2002 
and November 2003 in four Finnish hospitals. The effect of co-morbidity on HRQoL 
was measured by the generic 15D instrument and by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). 
Comparative variance analysis of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics 
was described by using either an independent samples t-test or the Chi-square 
test. The differences in each of the 15D dimensions and the overall 15D single 
index score for patients were calculated. Two-sided p-values were calculated 
with the Levene Test for Equality of Variances.
RESULTS: Patients with co-morbidity totaled 649; the incidence of co-morbidity 
was 73%. The mean number of co-morbidities among the patients was two. At 
baseline the 15D score in patients with and without co-morbidity was 0.778 vs 
0.816, respectively. The difference of the score (0.038) was clinically and 
statistically significant (P < 0.001). The patients' scores with and without 
co-morbidity on the different 15D dimensions related to osteoarthritis-moving, 
sleeping, usual activities, discomfort and symptoms, vitality and sexual 
activity-were low in both groups. Patients with co-morbidity scored lower on the 
dimensions of moving, vitality and sexual activity compared to the patients 
without co-morbidity. Co-morbidity was significantly associated with a reduced 
HRQoL. Patients without co-morbidity had poorer VAS, arthritis had strong effect 
to their quality of life compared to the patients with co-morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Assessing co-morbidity in patients placed on the waiting list for 
joint replacement may be useful method to prioritization in medical 
decision-making for healthcare delivery. The assessment of co-morbidities during 
waiting time is important as well as evaluating how the co-morbidity may affect 
the final outcomes of the total joint replacement.

OBJECTIVE: The Brief Satisfaction With Appearance Scale measures two dimensions 
(Dissatisfaction with Appearance and Social Discomfort) of body image 
dissatisfaction in systemic sclerosis. This study examined the structural 
validity of the Brief Satisfaction With Appearance Scale across limited and 
diffuse systemic sclerosis subtypes, compared body image dissatisfaction by 
systemic sclerosis subtype, and identified the significant sociodemographic and 
medical correlates of body image dissatisfaction and whether they differed by 
subtype.
METHODS: Participants were 183 adults participating in the University of 
California, Los Angeles Scleroderma Quality of Life Study with limited cutaneous 
(n = 101) or diffuse cutaneous (n = 82) systemic sclerosis who received clinical 
examinations and completed questionnaires. Multiple-group confirmatory factor 
analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and structural equation modeling 
were used.
RESULTS: The Brief Satisfaction With Appearance Scale's two-factor structure fit 
well for both subtypes. Patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis reported 
greater body image dissatisfaction on both factors than patients with limited 
disease. Greater Dissatisfaction with Appearance was associated with younger age 
and being unmarried for limited patients, and with younger age and increased 
finger/hand skin involvement for diffuse patients. Greater Social Discomfort was 
associated with younger age and being unmarried for both subtypes.
CONCLUSION: The Brief Satisfaction With Appearance Scale scores can be 
meaningfully compared across limited and diffuse systemic sclerosis. Patients 
with diffuse disease reported more body image dissatisfaction than those with 
limited disease. Findings demonstrate that both medical and sociodemographic 
variables are associated with body image dissatisfaction in systemic sclerosis 
and can be used to identify which patients may be at increased risk for body 
image dissatisfaction.

INTRODUCTION: Quality of life (QoL) can be simply defined as an area of human 
life that directly affects people which they consider to be important. This can 
be defined in greater detail as 'an individual perception of an individual's 
life position within a cultural context, value system and in relation to their 
tasks, expectations and standards determined by environmental conditions'. The 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) more specifically focuses on how the QoL 
affects health (including both medical and non-medical issues). Limitations in 
well-being will, by association, also occur in those children suffering with 
sinus diseases.
STUDY AIM: To compare the quality of life in children-adolescents suffering from 
some of the most commonly occurring childhood diseases of chronic rhinitis and 
sinusitis on a group of healthy children-adolescents. Test materials and 
methods: Subjects were children-adolescents with at least one of the 
aforementioned conditions afflicting the upper respiratory tract. Admission 
criteria were: ages 5 to 18 years in the presence of a chronic disease such as 
chronic rhinitis and paranasal sinusitis. The Child Health Questionnaire-Parent 
Form 50 CHQ-PF-50 (CHQ-PF50) was used, which is a general-purpose research 
instrument based on psychometric testing designed for assessing physical and 
mental well-being in children-adolescents aged 5 to 18 years.
RESULTS: Wellbeing significantly deteriorated in sick children within the 
following areas: current health status of the child (STAND), physical fitness 
(PF), social functioning resulting from behaviour or emotional state (REB), the 
impact of physical health on limitations in social functioning (RP), pain and 
discomfort (BP), behaviour (BE), mental health (MH), self-esteem (SE), general 
health perception (GH), influence of the child's health condition on parental 
emotions (PE), limitations on parental leisure time due to the child's health 
(PT) and restrictions on joint family activities (FA).
CONCLUSIONS: The greatest impairment to well-being in children with chronic 
rhinitis and paranasal sinusitis was on the impact of the child's health status 
on parents' emotions, pain and discomfort and general perception of health. This 
study confirms that parents of healthy children attach great importance to their 
health and health-related quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate and compare pain intensity and Oral 
Health-related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) in women with temporomandibular disorder 
(TMD) before (T1) and during (T2) COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sample was composed of forty-one female participants with 
painful TMD, who presented for TMD treatment. Subjects were asked to indicate 
their pain intensity and to answer the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14). 
Participants data were collected twice: T1 (evaluation of medical records 
fulfilled before COVID-19 pandemic) and T2 (by means of an online form). 
Socio-demographic data were assessed in T1. Statistical analysis was performed 
with a significance level of 5% (Wilcoxon, chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, 
multiple linear regressions).
RESULTS: No difference was found in pain intensity (p=0.26) and OHIP-14 global 
scores (p=0.53). Physical pain (p=0.03) and social disability (p=0.05) domains 
improved. In T1, subject's occupation was associated with OHIP-14 global score, 
physical pain, and physical disability domains. In T2, age was associated with 
OHIP-14 global scores as well as physical pain, psychological discomfort, and 
psychological disability domains.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic did not worsen pain intensity and OHRQoL in women 
with painful TMD, and it is suggested that socio-demographic characteristics 
influenced TMD patients coping skills during pandemic.

OBJETIVO: O presente estudo objetivou avaliar e comparar a intensidade da dor e 
a Qualidade de Vida Relacionada à Saúde Bucal (QVRSB) de mulheres com disfunção 
temporomandibular (DTM), antes (T1) e durante (T2) a pandemia de COVID-19.
MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta por quarenta e uma mulheres com DTM dolorosa, 
que se apresentaram para manejo da DTM. As participantes informaram a 
intensidade da dor por meio de escala numérica, e responderam ao questionário 
Perfil de Impacto na Saúde Oral - 14 (Oral Health Impact Profile, OHIP-14). Os 
dados das participantes foram coletados duas vezes: T1 (avaliação de prontuários 
odontológicos preenchidos previamente à pandemia de COVID-19) e T2 (por meio de 
formulário on-line). Dados sociodemográficos foram coletados em T1. A análise 
estatística foi realizada com nível de significância de 5% (testes de Wilcoxon, 
qui-quadrado ou exato de Fisher, e regressões lineares múltiplas).
RESULTADOS: Nenhuma diferença foi encontrada para a intensidade da dor (p = 
0,26) e o escore global do OHIP-14 (p = 0,53). Os domínios relativos à dor 
física (p = 0,03) e incapacidade social (p = 0,05) melhoraram. Em T1, a ocupação 
das participantes foi associada ao escore global do OHIP-14 e aos domínios de 
dor e incapacidade física. Em T2, a idade foi associada aos escores globais do 
OHIP-14, bem como aos domínios dor física, desconforto psicológico e 
incapacidade psicológica.
CONCLUSÃO: A pandemia de COVID-19 não piorou a sensibilidade à dor e a QVRSB das 
mulheres com DTM dolorosa, e as características sociodemográficas influenciaram 
suas habilidades de enfrentamento.

Recreational running (RR) is becoming a popular way to increase physical 
activity for improving health, together with a higher incidence of knee 
injuries. The aim was to analyze the effect of a four-week supplementation with 
a mixture of Harpagophytum procumbens, Zingiber officinale and Bixa orellana on 
males, middle-aged, RR with an undiagnosed knee discomfort. A randomized 
triple-blind placebo-control trial was conducted among male RR aged 40-60 years 
suffering from self-declared knee discomfort after training. Participants were 
assigned to supplementation (2 g/day in 6 doses; n  =  13; intervention group 
(IG)) or matched placebo (n  =  15; control group (CG)) for 4 weeks. At pre- and 
post-intervention, assessment of routine blood biomarkers, body composition, 
running biomechanics and body temperature was performed using standardized 
procedures. Machine learning (ML) techniques were used to classify whether 
subjects belonged to IG or CG. ML model was able to correctly classify 
individuals as IG or CG with a median accuracy of 0.857. Leg fat mass decreased 
significantly (p = 0.037) and a deeper reduction in knee thermograms was 
observed in IG (p < 0.05). Safety evaluation revealed no significant differences 
in the rest of parameters studied. Subjects belonging to IG or CG are clearly 
differentiated, pointing into an effect of the supplement of ameliorating 
inflammation.

INTRODUCTION: Many of the patients using ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) experience 
poor fit, pain, discomfort, dislike of the aesthetics of the device, and 
excessive range of motion restrictions, which diminish the use of AFOs. Although 
3D-printed ankle-foot orthoses (3D-AFOs) affect patient satisfaction and overall 
gait functions such as ankle moment, joint range of motion (ROM), and 
temporal-spatial parameters, the material properties and manufacturing process 
of 3D-AFOs are still diverse; the clinical effects of community ambulation using 
3D-AFOs and satisfaction in patients with stroke are poorly understood.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1: A 30-year-old man, with a history of right basal 
ganglia hemorrhage, presented with marked foot drop and genu recurvatum. Case 2: 
A 58-year-old man, with a history of multifocal scattered infarction, presented 
with an asymmetrical gait pattern due to abnormal pelvic movement. Case 3: A 
47-year-old man, with a history of right putamen hemorrhage, presented with 
recent poor balance and a prominent asymmetrical gait pattern due to increased 
ankle spasticity and tremor. All patients could walk independently with AFOs.
INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Gait was assessed under three walking (even, uneven, 
and stair ascent/descent) and four AFO (no shoes, only shoes, shoes with AFOs, 
and shoes with 3D-AFOs) conditions. After 4 weeks of community ambulation 
training with 3D-AFO or AFO, the patients were followed up. Spatiotemporal 
parameters; joint kinematics; muscle efficiency; clinical evaluations including 
impairments, limitations, and participation; and patient satisfaction with 
wearing 3D-AFO were evaluated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 3D-AFOs were suitable for community ambulation of 
patients with chronic stroke and effective on step length, stride width, 
symmetry, ankle range of motion, and muscle efficiency during even surface 
walking and stair ascent in patients with chronic stroke. The 4-week community 
ambulation training with 3D-AFOs did not promote patient participation; however, 
it increased ankle muscle strength, balance, gait symmetry, and gait endurance 
and reduced depression among patients with a history of stroke. The participants 
were satisfied with 3D-AFO's thinness, lightweight, comfortable feeling with 
wearing shoes, and gait adjustability.

BACKGROUND: EQ5D is a generic measure of health. It provides a single index 
value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation 
of healthcare. Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a joint-specific outcome measure tool 
designed to assess symptoms and function in osteoarthritis patients after joint 
replacement surgery. Though widely used, it has the disadvantage of lacking 
health index value. To fill the gap between functional and generic 
questionnaires with economic value, we linked generic EQ-5D-5L to the specific 
OKS to give a single index value for health status in KOA patients.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Developing and evaluating an algorithm to estimate EuroQoL 
generic health utility scores (EQ-5D-5L) from the disease-specific OKS using 
data from patients with knee osteoarthritis (KO).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 571 patients with KO. 
We used four distinct mapping algorithms: Cumulative Probability for Ordinal 
Data, Penalized Ordinal Regression, CART (Classification and Regression Trees), 
and Ordinal random forest. We compared the resultant models' degrees of 
accuracy.
RESULTS: Mobility was best predicted by penalized regression with pre-processed 
predictors, usual activities by random forest, pain/discomfort by cumulative 
probability with pre-processed predictors, self-care by random forest with RFE 
(recursive feature elimination) predictors, and anxiety/depression by CART with 
RFE predictors. Model accuracy was lowest with anxiety/depression and highest 
with mobility and usual activities. Using available country value sets, the 
average MAE was 0.098 ± 0.022, ranging from 0.063 to 0.142; and the average MSE 
was 0.020 ± 0.008 ranging from 0.008 to 0.042.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study derived accurate mapping techniques from OKS to 
the domains of EQ-5D-5L, allowing for the computation of QALYs in economic 
evaluations. A machine learning-based strategy offers a viable mapping 
alternative that merits further exploration.

BACKGROUND: Pulse radiofrequency (PRF) therapy is one of effective physical 
therapy modalities for treat temporomandibular disorders (TMD). This prospective 
randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the long-term treatment efficacy 
and patient satisfaction with PRF therapy in TMD.
METHODS: Eighty-six female patients with TMD were randomly assigned to either 
pulsed radiofrequency or placebo therapy in combination with other conventional 
treatments once a week for 12 weeks. A final analysis was performed 12 weeks 
after the completion of treatment. Clinical parameters and patient satisfaction 
were analyzed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of intervention and at 24 weeks 
from baseline.
RESULTS: Pain intensity, comfortable and maximum mouth opening, and pain on 
capsule and masticatory muscle palpation were significantly improved after 
treatment in both groups. Notably, the pulsed radiofrequency group showed a 
significantly lower pain intensity at the final evaluation performed 3 months 
after the completion of treatment. Significantly more patients reported 
subjective pain improvement and satisfaction with treatment following 
intervention at baseline in the PRF group. Most patients did not report any 
discomfort following treatment in either group. However, significantly more 
patients in the PRF group reported a burning sensation with intervention.
CONCLUSION: Long-term regular pulsed radiofrequency therapy was effective in 
significantly reducing TMD pain, and the effect was long-lasting following 
treatment completion. Pulsed radiofrequency therapy should be considered as a 
supportive physical therapy modality for TMD.

Objectives Our primary goal in this study was to investigate whether the 
surgical treatment we performed on the patients with dorsal carpal ganglion was 
effective rather than evaluating preoperative and postoperative functional 
results. Methods The retrospective study included patients who were operated 
with open technique due to dorsal wrist ganglion at a single center between 
March 1, 2015, and December 1, 2017, and were followed for at least six months. 
Thirty-three wrists of 32 patients (31 unilateral and 1 bilateral) were 
operated. During follow-ups, complication rates, patient satisfaction, and 
recurrence rates were evaluated. Results Of the 32 patients, 19 were females and 
13 were males. Mean age of the patients was 38.6 ± 13.0 years (min-max = 19-60 
years). Excision was performed on 28 right and 5 left wrists. The follow-up 
period of patients varied between 6 months and 38 months (mean = 21.7 ± 9.4 
months). Recurrence was detected in four (12.5%) patients during the 
postoperative period. Complex regional pain syndrome occurred in two (6.25%) 
patients. Joint stiffness developed in six (18.75%) patients during the 
postoperative period. When recurrent cases were excluded from our cases, the 
satisfaction rate was 87.5%. Conclusions Open surgical excision has satisfactory 
results that cannot be achieved with conservative treatment in the treatment of 
symptomatic dorsal ganglia. In order to keep the recurrence rate at the minimum 
level after surgery, it is critical to excise the ganglion and pedicle without 
leaving any residual tissue. Proper surgical technique improves patient 
satisfaction by eliminating pain and cosmetic discomfort.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of anterior glenohumeral instability with a Bankart 
repair combined with a capsular plication is a frequently used arthroscopic 
technique. Latarjet created an open bone block procedure in 1954 for the 
treatment of anteroinferior glenohumeral instability. This procedure has been 
further developed by Lafosse in 2003 for arthroscopic surgery. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate the clinical outcome and complications of the latter 
procedure, most notably infection rate and nerve damage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 132 shoulders (106 males/19 females, 68 right/64 left) 
were included in this retrospective study. Patients were included if treatment 
was performed for anterior instability and if the patient's instability severity 
index score was at least 4, or if a revision procedure was performed after a 
prior unsuccessful arthroscopic or open capsule and labral repair. Treatment 
included the arthroscopic transfer of the coracoid process for the anterior 
stabilization of the shoulder joint. The disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and 
hand score were evaluated postoperatively in 76 patients and compared with the 
results found in the literature. Mean followup was 20.1 [±14.09] months.
RESULTS: The rate of recurrent glenohumeral instability which needed revision 
surgery after the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure was 6.1% (n = 8). There were 
no severe neurovascular complications seen in our cohort. In 32 cases, 
re-operation was performed due to subjective discomfort because of screw 
impingement or postoperative shoulder stiffness.
CONCLUSION: The all-arthroscopic Latarjet procedure developed by Lafosse is a 
valid and reliable method for the treatment of shoulder instability. Our 
favorable results indicating that this procedure can prevent chronic shoulder 
luxation are repeatable, and the rate of postoperative recurrence is low.

OBJECTIVE: In order to examine the relationship between 25-hydroxyl vitamin D 
and knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) publications was hereby performed.
METHODS: For the purpose of finding pertinent research, the databases of PubMed, 
Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched. Factors including tibial 
cartilage volume, joint space width (JSW), synovial fluid volume, and Western 
Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) were correspondingly 
evaluated, and the results were expressed using SMD and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI).
RESULTS: The present meta-analysis evaluated the effects of vitamin D 
supplementation in patients with knee osteoarthritis, with 3,077 patients 
included. The results showed that vitamin D administration had a statistically 
significant impact on the amount of synovial fluid, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
and tibial cartilage. The pain and function scales of the WOMAC scale presented 
a statistically significant difference, and there was no discernible difference 
between the vitamin D and placebo groups in the stiffness scale. Additionally, 
bone marrow lesions and alterations in the diameter of the joint space were not 
influenced by the administration of vitamin D, and according to a subgroup 
study, a daily vitamin D supplement containing more than 2,000 IU significantly 
slowed the development of synovial tissue.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did benefit those suffering from knee 
discomfort and knee dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the incidence and risk factors for 
emergence agitation (EA) in elderly patients who underwent total joint 
arthroplasty (TJA) under general anaesthesia, and to assess their predictive 
values.
DESIGN: Single-centre retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: A 1600-bed general tertiary hospital in China.
PARTICIPANTS: This study enrolled 421 elderly patients scheduled for elective 
primary TJA under general anaesthesia.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: EA was assessed using the Richmond 
Agitation Sedation Scale during the awakening period after surgery in the 
post-anaesthesia care unit. Risk factors for EA were identified using univariate 
and multivariable logistic analyses. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve was used to assess the predictive values of the risk factors for EA.
RESULTS: The incidence of EA in elderly patients who underwent TJA was 37.6%. 
According to the multivariable logistic analysis, postoperative pain (95% CI: 
1.951 to 3.196), male sex (95% CI: 1.781 to 6.435), catheter-related bladder 
discomfort (CRBD) (95% CI: 4.001 to 15.392) and longer fasting times for solids 
(95% CI: 1.260 to 2.301) and fluids (95% CI: 1.263 to 2.365) were independent 
risk factors for EA. As shown by the ROC analysis, postoperative pain and 
fasting times for solids and fluids had good predictive values, with areas under 
the ROC curve equalling 0.769, 0.753 and 0.768, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: EA is a common complication after TJA in elderly patients. Some 
risk factors, including postoperative pain, male sex, CRBD and longer fasting 
times, can increase the incidence of EA. These risk factors may contribute to 
identifying high-risk patients, which facilitates the development of effective 
strategies to prevent and treat EA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fast-track total joint replacement (TJR) has become 
increasingly common. Routine thromboprophylaxis for pulmonary embolism and deep 
venous thrombosis prevention lasts from 2 to 5 weeks. This retrospective 
registry study focused on clinically relevant bleeding complications 90 days 
after fast-track primary TJR.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All primary fast-track total hip (THA) and knee 
arthroplasties (TKA) performed between 2015 and 2016 were extracted from the 
Finnish Arthroplasty Register and Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Type of 
arthroplasty and indication for the operation were combined with diagnoses of 
clinically relevant bleeding complications within 90 days of surgery. The 
incidence of these bleedings was the primary outcome measure.
RESULTS: Of the total of 8,511 patients (mean age 67 years (SD 10); 60% female), 
45% underwent unilateral THA, 52% unilateral TKA, and 3% bilateral TKA. The 
incidence of clinically relevant bleeding complications within 90 days was 1% 
(95% CI 0.8-1.3). No difference was observed in bleeding incidence between the 
groups. The 87 bleedings comprised 57 operative site bleedings, 17 
gastrointestinal bleedings, 6 intracranial non-traumatic bleedings, 5 bleedings 
from the nose or another undetermined site, and 2 intraocular bleedings. 1 death 
due to intracranial bleeding was recorded, and hence clinically relevant 
bleeding-specific 90-day mortality was 0.01%.
INTERPRETATION: The incidence of clinically relevant bleeding complications was 
low. However, they cause patient discomfort, increase the use of healthcare 
services, and can be life-threatening and even fatal.

Robots are being used to assist the recovery of walking ability for patients 
with neurologic disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and 
functional improvement of training with robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) 
using the Morning Walk®, an end-effector type robot using footplates and saddle 
seat support. A total of 189 individuals (65.1% men, 34.9% women; mean age, 53.2 
years; age range: 5-87 years) with brain lesions, spinal cord injuries, 
Parkinson's disease, peripheral neuropathies, and pediatric patients were 
involved in this retrospectively registered clinical trial. Each participant 
performed 30 minutes of RAGT, five times a week, for a total of 24 sessions. 
Failure was defined as an inability to complete all 24 sessions, and the reasons 
for discontinuation were analyzed. Parameters of Medical Research Council scales 
and Functional Ambulation Categories were analyzed before and after RAGT 
training. Among the 189 patients, 22 (11.6%) failed to complete the RAGT. The 
reasons included decreased cooperation, musculoskeletal pain, saddle seat 
discomfort, excessive body-weight support, joint spasticity or restricted joint 
motion, urinary incontinence from an indwelling urinary catheter, and fatigue. 
Comparison between the pre- and post-training motor and ambulatory functions 
showed significant improvement. The result of the study indicates that the 
Morning Walk® is feasible and safe and useful for functional improvement in 
patients with various neurologic disorders.

BACKGROUND: Psychological discomfort, physical disability and functional 
limitations of the orofacial system have a major impact on everyday life of 
patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). In this study we sought to 
determine short and long term effects of stabilization splint (SS) in treatment 
of TMDs, and to identify factors influencing its efficacy.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched for randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SS to: non-occluding splint, occlusal oral 
appliances, physiotherapy, behavioral therapy, counseling and no treatment. 
Random effects method was used to summarize outcomes. The effect estimates were 
expressed as odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% 
confidence interval. Subgroup analyses were carried out according to the use of 
Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) and TMDs origin. Strength of evidence was 
assessed by GRADE. Meta-regression was applied.
RESULTS: Thirty three eligible RCTs were included in meta-analysis. In short 
term, SS presented positive overall effect on pain reduction (OR 2.08; p = 0.01) 
and pain intensity (SMD -0.33; p = 0.02). Subgroup analyses confirmed SS effect 
in studies used RDC/TMD and revealed its effect in patients with TMDs of 
muscular origin. Important decrease of muscle tenderness (OR 1.97; p = 0.03) and 
improvement of mouth opening (SMD -0.30; p = 0.04) were found. SS in comparison 
to oral appliances showed no difference (OR 0.74; p = 0.24). Meta-regression 
identified continuous use of SS during the day as a factor influencing efficacy 
(p = 0.01). Long term results showed no difference in observed outcomes between 
groups. Low quality of evidence was found for primary outcomes.
CONCLUSION: SS presented short term benefit for patients with TMDs. In long term 
follow up, the effect is equalized with other therapeutic modalities. Further 
studies based on appropriate use of standardized criteria for patient 
recruitment and outcomes under assessment are needed to better define SS effect 
persistence in long term.

INTRODUCTION: Steroid hormone blocking is a common treatment for tenosynovitis. 
However, local steroid hormone blocking requires careful attention to the local 
inflammatory response, as infection can cause severe local soft tissue 
inflammation and damage.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 46-year-old female patient received local steroid 
hormone blocking treatment for tenosynovitis of the right thumb at another 
hospital 3 months earlier. Five days later, the patient gradually experienced 
redness, swelling, and pain in her right hand. By day 7, the symptoms worsened 
with increased swelling, wrist pain, and finger numbness. After the carpal 
tunnel incision, the patient's symptoms improved upon admission to the local 
hospital's emergency department. However, 2 weeks post-operation, she 
experienced recurring numbness, pain, discomfort, and local sinus exudation in 
her right hand, which worsened over 2 months, prompting the patient to seek 
outpatient treatment at our hospital.
DISCUSSION: An increase in local content within the wrist joint content is a 
major cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Repeated stimulation of the inflamed 
tissues often leads to the development of granulomatous hyperplasia. 
Hyperplastic granulomas often produce local compression. If located in the 
peripheral nerve duct, it may cause nerve entrapment and lead to peripheral 
nerve injury. Surgery is often required to excise the hyperplastic tissue and 
release the entrapped nerve.
CONCLUSION: Prompt and thorough debridement is necessary for addressing local 
soft tissue infections caused by suppurative tenosynovitis. Failure to do so may 
result in recurrent local granuloma hyperplasia and the development of local 
compression diseases, especially in wrist median nerve compression cases.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet (WALANT) 
is a surgical technique used in hand surgery that allows for active patient 
participation during surgery while avoiding the pain and discomfort associated 
with general anesthesia and tourniquets. Using this technique for tenolysis 
enables a surgeon to assess the repair intraoperatively. However, this technique 
is more commonly used in adults than in pediatric patients. We aimed to present 
a case that may contribute to the use of the WALANT technique on the pediatric 
population.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case presents the successful use of the WALANT technique 
multiple times in a 7-year-old Hispanic male patient to repair recurrent tendon 
adhesions and joint contracture due to a prior gunshot wound that caused a 
comminuted, displaced fracture with intra-articular extension of the third 
finger.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, few reports and case series 
of WALANT hand surgery in children are available within the literature. The 
presented case is rare in terms of the mechanism of injury, the age of the 
patient, and the fact that multiple WALANT interventions were successfully 
performed on the same patient.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showcase the potential of the WALANT technique on 
pediatric patients as an alternative to traditional techniques. Due to the 
scarcity of pediatric WALANT cases in the literature, and the benefits provided 
by the technique, this case report may be of clinical relevance.

BACKGROUND: Although the biomechanical features of the golf swing are extremely 
determined, multiple joint movements with limited pelvic and thoracic rotation 
movement can cause injury to the golfer and are linked with low back pain (LBP). 
We have developed the Pulley Master machine (PM), which is designed to offer 
active movement evaluation and monitoring as well as repetitive and 
task-specific training.
OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of the present research was to analyze the effects 
of PM and Transfer of Electricity-Capacitive and Resistive (TECAR) therapy on 
the lumbar pain scale and thoracic and pelvic mobility in amateur golfers with 
LBP.
METHODS: Twenty-one amateur golfers with LBP (six females, mean age = 23.43 ± 
2.36 years) were randomly assigned to either PM or TECAR groups for five days 
per week over one week. Clinical outcome measurements included pelvic and 
thoracic mobility as well as a pain rating scale. Statistical analyses were 
presented using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the statistical 
significance level was set at P< 0.05.
RESULTS: ANOVA showed that PM outperformed TECAR in terms of pelvic and thoracic 
mobility as well as a pain rating scale.
CONCLUSION: The results provide novel and encouraging clinical evidence that PM 
improves pain control and mobility in amateur golfers with LBP.

BACKGROUND: Empathy is important for successful interactions. The aim of the 
present study was to determine whether the cognitive component (Perspective 
taking) and affective components (Empathic concern and Personal distress) of 
empathy in health professionals were related to the degree of perceived threat 
of coronavirus, difficulties in doing work, difficulties in getting along with 
people, the health condition (current or past coronavirus disease), as well as 
with some socio-demographic characteristics. Fantasy as the cognitive component 
of empathy was not the focus of the present study as more irrelevant to clinical 
practice.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A study of 296 health care workers through the 
Interpersonal Reactivity Index and a survey on perceived coronavirus threat, 
difficulties in work and getting along with people found that perceiving 
coronavirus as a stronger threat reduced both the cognitive component of empathy 
Perspective taking and the affective component of empathy Personal distress.
RESULTS: As the affective components of empathy Empathic concern and Personal 
distress increased, the reported work difficulties were reduced. As the 
cognitive component of empathy Perspective taking and the affective component of 
empathy Personal distress increased, the reported difficulties in having a good 
relationship with other people were reduced. Some socio-demographic differences 
in the components of empathy in health workers were also established.
CONCLUSION: These findings revealed the importance of Personal Distress 
(experienced anxiety, worry, discomfort, and apprehension when observing another 
person's negative experiences), as well as the joint manifestation of several 
aspects of empathy for successful work and maintaining good relationships in 
health care. Emotionality is a normal part of human interactions, so 
manifestations of cognitive empathy should not be only considered as 
appropriate, and emotional empathy should not be ruled out as unnecessary in 
clinical practice during the coronavirus pandemic.

Background Menopause is a challenging period for all women. The severity of 
menopausal symptoms hurts their quality of life and daily activity. The aim of 
this study was to investigate whether the severity of menopausal symptoms are 
associated with social support and lifestyle factors among Saudi women to help 
policymakers develop the appropriate intervention health program. Methods A 
cross-sectional study of 361 middle-aged Saudi women was conducted through 
interviews using a valid and reliable questionnaire. The menopause rating scale 
(MRS) was used to determine the severity of menopausal symptoms and the 
multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) was used to assess 
perceived social support among females. Linear regression was conducted to 
assess the association between MRS scores and MSPSS scores after adjustment of 
covariates. Results The mean total menopause rating scale was 13.7 ± 8.3. 
Physical and mental exhaustion (80.3%), joint and muscular discomfort (79.2%), 
and irritability (75.9%) were the most prevalent menopausal symptoms for all 
women. The mean MSPSS was calculated as 4.3 ±1.8. Perceived social support and 
lifestyle factors were significant predictors of menopausal symptoms. 
Conclusions Postmenopausal Saudi women complain of a variety of physical and 
psychological symptoms. The current study shows that social support, quitting 
smoking, losing weight, and increasing physical exercise can help to alleviate 
or reduce many of the unpleasant symptoms of menopause. This evidence will help 
policymakers design health intervention for this age group.

The Proximal Fasciocutaneous Hypothenar Flap Based on the Cutaneous Branch of 
the Deep Palmar Artery: A Case Report.

Postan D(1).

Author information:
(1)Buenos Aires Burns Hospital, Argentina.

The abductor digiti quinti flap for thumb hypoplasia has been used in its 
muscular variant as musculocutaneous flap. Several authors have reported 
myocutaneous branches in the proximal hypothenar region which would vascularize 
the skin segment covering the hypothenar muscles. Nevertheless, the presence of 
a cutaneous branch deep palmar artery (CBDPA) vascularizing the proximal 
hypothenar territory and possibly responsible for the proximal hypothenar 
cutaneous vascularization was reported. In this paper, a fasciocutaneous 
hypothenar flap was designed, based on the CBDPA, transposed to the wrist 
anterior region for the treatment of a post burn contracture which was limiting 
the wrist extension. Its viability was assessed. The flap had a lozenge-shaped 
design from the cutaneous fold of the wrist to the fifth metacarpophalangeal 
joint over the abductor digiti quinti muscle. It was dissected in the 
fasciocutaneous plane to a width of 20 mm. The adipose tissue zone 10 mm distal 
to the pisiform was preserved, as well as the ulnar nerve sensory branch 
crossing the flap longitudinally. The flap was transposed to the anterior fold 
of the wrist. Neither the flap nor the donor site underwent complications. The 
patient improved wrist extension without referring any discomfort. Sensitivity 
was 8 mm 2 months after surgery compared to 6 mm within the preoperative period. 
In conclusion, it is possible to develop a proximal fasciocutaneous hypothenar 
flap based on CBDPA involving the proximal and distal hypothenar territory.

Mechanisms of Gait Asymmetry Due to Push-Off Deficiency in Unilateral Amputees.

Adamczyk PG, Kuo AD.

Unilateral lower-limb amputees exhibit asymmetry in many gait features, such as 
ground force, step time, step length, and joint mechanics. Although these 
asymmetries result from weak prosthetic-side push-off, there is no proven 
mechanistic explanation of how that impairment propagates to the rest of the 
body. We used a simple dynamic walking model to explore possible consequences of 
a unilateral impairment similar to that of a transtibial amputee. The model 
compensates for reduced push-off work from one leg by performing more work 
elsewhere, for example during the middle of stance by either or both legs. The 
model predicts several gait abnormalities, including slower forward velocity of 
the body center-of-mass during intact-side stance, greater energy dissipation in 
the intact side, and more positive work overall. We tested these predictions 
with data from unilateral transtibial amputees (N = 11) and nonamputee control 
subjects (N = 10) walking on an instrumented treadmill. We observed several 
predicted asymmetries, including forward velocity during stance phases and 
energy dissipation from the two limbs, as well as greater work overall. 
Secondary adaptations, such as to reduce discomfort, may exacerbate asymmetry, 
but these simple principles suggest that some asymmetry may be unavoidable in 
cases of unilateral limb loss.

BACKGROUND: People with hemophilia (PWH) experience frequent joint bleeding, 
resulting in pain and functional impairment. Generic and disease-specific 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments have been used in clinical studies, 
but rarely in the comprehensive hemophilia care setting.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess construct validity of PRO 
instruments measuring pain, functional impairment, and health-related quality of 
life in US PWH with a history of joint pain/bleeding.
METHODS: Adult male PWH completed 4 PRO instruments (EQ-5D-5L with visual analog 
scale, Brief Pain Inventory v2 Short Form [BPI], SF-36v2, Hemophilia Activities 
List [HAL]) and underwent a musculoskeletal examination (Hemophilia Joint Health 
Score v2.1 [HJHS]). Construct validity between index and domain scores was 
evaluated by Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: A total of 381 PWH were enrolled. EQ-5D-5L Mobility correlated with 
BPI, SF-36v2, and HAL domains related to pain, physical function, and activity 
of the lower extremities. EQ-5D-5L Self-Care correlated only with HAL Self-Care. 
EQ-5D-5L Usual Activities correlated with BPI Pain Interference and domains 
within SF-36v2 and HAL related to pain and physical function/activities 
(particularly those involving the lower extremities). EQ-5D-5L Pain/Discomfort 
correlated with Bodily Pain and Physical Summary on SF-36v2, HAL Overall 
Activity, and all BPI pain domains. EQ-5D-5L Anxiety/Depression correlated with 
social/emotional/mental aspects of SF-36v2. On BPI, most pain domains correlated 
with Bodily Pain and Physical Health Summary on SF-36v2 and Overall Activity on 
HAL. On SF-36v2, Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, and Physical 
Health summary scores correlated with all the domains of HAL except Self-Care. 
For HJHS, Ankle and Total scores correlated with SF-36v2 Physical Functioning 
and HAL Lying/Sitting, Leg Function, Complex Lower Extremity Activity, and 
Overall Activity.
CONCLUSION: All PRO instruments have high construct validity but provide 
different levels of detail in describing effects of hemophilia. Instrument 
choice may depend on individuals' symptoms, treatment planning goals, or outcome 
tracking research objectives, with consideration for administrative burden.

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies on the diabetes-edentulism relationship have 
yielded conflicting results. Therefore, the goal of this study was to 
investigate the association between diabetes and edentulism, and their joint 
effects on health status in adults from 40 low and middle-income countries 
(LMICs).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the World Health Survey were used for 
this cross-sectional study (2002-2004). Forty countries (18 low-income and 22 
middle-income countries) were included. Edentulism and diabetes were assessed 
using yes-no questions based on self-report. Health status was assessed in seven 
different domains (self-care, pain/discomfort, cognition, interpersonal 
activities, sleep/energy, affect, and perceived stress). The association between 
diabetes (exposure) and edentulism (outcome) was analyzed using multivariable 
logistic regression models, while their joint effects on health status were 
assessed using multivariable linear regression models.
RESULTS: There were 175 814 adults aged ≥18 years included in this study (mean 
(SD) age 38.4 (16.0) years; 49.3% men). Overall, the prevalence of edentulism 
was 6.0% and diabetes was 2.9%. There was a positive and significant association 
between diabetes and edentulism in the overall sample (OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.18 to 
1.66), in low-income countries (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.62) and in 
middle-income countries (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47). In addition, people with 
comorbid diabetes and edentulism had worse health status in the domains of 
cognition, sleep/energy, and perceived stress, compared with those with diabetes 
only.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was positively associated with edentulism in this sample 
of more than 175 000 individuals living in LMICs. Providing oral care to 
individuals with diabetes may potentially lead to a reduction in their risk of 
edentulism.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of 
temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients at the final follow-up visit, and to 
investigate the associated factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 227 TMD patients. 
Dependent variable was OHRQoL determined by telephone interview using the 
14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire after the final 
follow-up visit. Independent variables were collected from dental records, 
comprising age, sex, treatment duration, diagnosis, clinical parameters 
(mouth-opening distances), and pain perception. TMD patients were diagnosed as 
having masticatory muscle disorders (TMDM), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) 
disorders (TMDJ), or combined muscle and TMJ disorders (TMDC). Bivariate 
analyses and multivariable linear regression were used to analyze the factors 
associated with OHIP-14 scores.
RESULTS: Bivariate analyses demonstrated higher OHIP-14 scores in younger 
patients, females, having TMDC, and lower mouth-opening distance. Multivariable 
analysis demonstrated the association of higher OHIP-14 scores with being 
younger and having TMDC. Participants with TMDC demonstrated greater improvement 
in unassisted mouth-opening distance, compared with the other clinical diagnosis 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: At the final follow-up visit, oral health impact problems were 
reported mainly in physical pain and psychological discomfort domains. Better 
OHRQoL was found in older, and TMDM or TMDJ patients.

Meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) is a treatment modality for restoring 
knee function in patients with irreversible meniscal injury. Strengthening 
programs to promote functional recovery are treated with caution during the 
intermediate rehabilitation phase following MAT. This study analyzed the effects 
of aquatic training (AQT) and bicycling training (BCT) during the intermediate 
stage of rehabilitation in amateur athletes that underwent MAT. Participants (n 
= 60) were divided into AQT (n = 30) and BCT (n = 30) groups. Both groups 
performed training three times per week from 6 to 24 weeks following surgery. 
International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form 
(IKDC) score, knee joint range of motion (ROM), isokinetic knee strength, and 
Y-balance test (YBT) performance were evaluated. All measured variables for the 
AQT and BCT groups improved significantly after training compared with 
pre-training values. The IKDC score and YBT were significantly higher for AQT 
than for BCT. The knee flexion ROM and isokinetic muscle strength were 
significantly improved in the BCT group compared to those in the AQT group. The 
AQT group exhibited greater improvement in dynamic balance, whereas BCT provided 
greater improvement in isokinetic muscle strength. AQT and BCT were effective in 
reducing discomfort and improving knee symptoms and functions during 
intermediate-stage rehabilitation following MAT in amateur athletes.

BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a set of distressing symptoms 
experienced around the time of menstrual flow. Hormonal changes may underlie 
these symptoms which can lead to difficulties in day-to-day functioning and poor 
quality of life.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 300 students attending the science 
stream at a women's college of Puducherry were administered self-reported 
questionnaires to obtain socio- demographic, dietary, lifestyle and family 
details. The Shortened Premenstrual Assessment Form was used to assess PMS, a 
symptom checklist was used to assess premenstrual dysphoric disorder and Short 
From 36 was used to assess quality of life.
RESULTS: The prevalence of PMS was 62.7%. Back, joint and muscle aches were the 
most common symptoms followed by abdominal heaviness and discomfort. PMS was 
associated with a poorer quality of life across all domains. About half the 
students had affective symptoms in the premenstrual phase.
CONCLUSION: Dietary and lifestyle factors such as consumption of sweets and lack 
of physical activity were associated with the presence of PMS.

Osteosarcoma arises most frequently in the metaphysis around the knee and its 
management by limb salvage surgery in skeletally immature pediatric patients is 
extremely challenging. Common reconstructive methods such as endoprosthetic or 
biological reconstruction are not fully capable of dealing with 
durability-related and growth-related problems and their functional outcomes are 
not as good as those seen in adult cases. A definitive limb salvaging procedure 
in children that outperforms amputation or rotationplasty has not yet been 
established. Herein, we report a case of stage IV osteosarcoma in the femur of a 
7-year-old boy that was safely managed with intercalary resection preserving the 
distal femoral growth plate and epiphysis, followed by biological reconstruction 
using a frozen tumor-devitalized autograft. Good response to preoperative 
chemotherapy and the diaphyseal location of the tumor enabled us to perform a 
tumor resection that spared the growth plate and preserved the native knee joint 
structure. Plate fixation over the growth plate was terminated by removing the 
locking screws in the epiphysis after 44 months, which restored growth capacity 
to some extent. At 50 months postoperatively, no recurrence or progression of 
the disease was observed. The patient uses an extension shoe and reports having 
little discomfort in his daily life despite having a restricted range of motion 
and limb length discrepancy. In conclusion, limb salvage with biological 
reconstruction in skeletally immature patients can provide an acceptable 
functional outcome, including minimized limb length discrepancy, if critical 
damage to the growth plate and articular components can be avoided.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a very common, slowly progressive and incurable 
articular disease resulting in the breakdown of cartilage and bone in the joint, 
which causes significant discomfort, pain and disability, with a significant 
socio-economic impact. The aim of our observational study for patients with 
symptomatic KOA was to investigate the changes of C-terminal telopeptide of type 
II collagen (CTX-II) in serum pre and post a complex rehabilitation program and 
to establish the correlation between all studied parameters [clinical, 
functional, serum CTX-II (sCTX-II) and histological aspects obtained through 
arthroscopy]. During 2016-2017, we performed an observational study including 24 
patients, between 59 and 76 years old, diagnosed with KOA. Studied patients were 
completely assessed before (T1) and four months after a complex rehabilitation 
program (T2). The measured parameters were stiffness, pain, and physical 
function and we used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, with Western 
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), sCTX-II value 
obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, histological 
assessment of knee cartilage after arthroscopy. In the histological assessment 
of our patients, we observed that the cells of the superficial areas were round 
and hypertrophic, the cartilage tissue had few proteoaminoglycans and 
glycosaminoglycans, with an airy aspect of the matrix and degenerate cells, 
numerically reduced. After positive diagnosis, the complete treatment, including 
the rehabilitation program, seems to be the ideal option for improving the 
CTX-II values, as well as the quality of life in KOA patients.

In the EU, lower back pain affects more than 40% of the working population. 
Mechanical loading of the lower back has been shown to be an important risk 
factor. Peak mechanical load can be reduced by ergonomic interventions, the use 
of cranes and, more recently, by the use of exoskeletons. Despite recent 
advances in the development of exoskeletons for industrial applications, they 
are not widely adopted by industry yet. Some of the challenges, which have to be 
overcome are a reduced range of motion, misalignment between the human anatomy 
and kinematics of the exoskeleton as well as discomfort. A body of research 
exists on how an exoskeleton can be designed to compensate for misalignment and 
thereby improve comfort. However, how to design an exoskeleton that achieves a 
similar range of motion as a human lumbar spine of up to 60° in the sagittal 
plane, has not been extensively investigated. We addressed this need by 
developing and testing a novel passive back support exoskeleton, including a 
mechanism comprised of flexible beams, which run in parallel to the spine, 
providing a large range of motion and lowering the peak torque requirements 
around the lumbo-sacral (L5/S1) joint. Furthermore, we ran a pilot study to test 
the biomechanical (N = 2) and functional (N = 3) impact on subjects while 
wearing the exoskeleton. The biomechanical testing was once performed with 
flexible beams as a back interface and once with a rigid structure. An increase 
of more than 25% range of motion of the trunk in the sagittal plane was observed 
by using the flexible beams. The pilot functional tests, which are compared to 
results from a previous study with the Laevo device, suggest, that the novel 
exoskeleton is perceived as less hindering in almost all tested tasks.

AIM: To evaluate the relationship between the state of transplanted liver graft 
and the recipient quality of life (QOL) of histologically proven lesions in a 
10-year post liver transplantation (LT) cohort of patients.
METHODS: Seventy-two recipients with a functional first graft at 10 years 
post-LT underwent liver biopsy and completed a QOL questionnaire. Logistic 
regression analysis was used to explore associations between histological, 
clinical and QOL criteria.
RESULTS: Ten years after LT, fibrosis was detected in 53% of patients, and 
affected the general health perception, while ductopenia, present in 36%, 
affected the well-being (P = 0.05). Hepatic steatosis (HS) was present in 33% of 
patients and was associated with the worst QOL score on multiple domains. When 
compared to patients without HS, patients with HS had significantly higher 
incidence of fibrosis (P = 0.03), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (P = 0.007), 
and more patients had retired from their job (P = 0.03). Recurrent or de novo 
HCV-associated fibrosis and patient retirement as objective variables, and 
abdominal pain or discomfort and joint aches or pains as subjective variables, 
emerged as independent determinants of HS.
CONCLUSION: Long-term liver graft lesions, mainly HS presumably as a surrogate 
marker of HCV infection, may have a substantial impact on QOL 10 years after LT.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Research on menopause in Arab women is limited. The 
aim of our study was to assess the commonly experienced symptoms of menopause 
and their severity among Saudi women.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study conducted at King Khalid University 
Hospital (KKUH) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred and ninety healthy women aged 40-55 years and 
either attending KKUH themselves or accompanying their relatives in outpatient 
clinics participated in the study. The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) was used to 
assess menopausal symptoms and severity.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the women in menopause was 47.9 (6.03) years. The 
most frequent symptoms were muscle and joint problems occurring in 411 women 
(83.9%), physical and mental exhaustion in 393 (80.2%), heart discomfort in 358 
(73.1%), sleeping disorders in 349 (71.2%), hot flashes in 348 (71.0%), and 
irritability in 348 (71.0%); in addition, 179 (36.5%) of these women experienced 
severe psychological distress. Perimenopausal women had higher total and 
subscales scorings for somatic symptoms than did premenopausal and 
postmenopausal women (P=.008).
CONCLUSION: The number of Saudi women reporting hot flashes and night sweats was 
comparable to the number of Western women. In addition, somatic symptoms were 
more prevalent among perimenopausal than among premenopausal women.

OBJECTIVES: Surgical removal of third molars is a regular surgical procedure, 
which like all operations, may have complications. The purpose of the study was 
to analyze the incidence of complications and their relationship with the 
surgical difficulty in a group of 588 patients treated by the same oral and 
maxillofacial surgeon.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 1699 third molars 
(M3) removed between 2005 and 2008. The teeth were grouped into a 6-class scale 
of surgical difficulty rated according to the surgical procedure description in 
the patient's file: I: upper M3 requiring forceps only; II: upper M3 requiring 
osteotomy; III: upper M3 requiring osteotomy and tooth section; IV: lower M3 
requiring forceps only; V: lower M3 requiring osteotomy; VI: lower M3 requiring 
osteotomy and tooth section. The complications were grouped into each surgical 
difficulty class and their incidence and management were also described.
RESULTS: 59 complications (3.47%), including pain, root tip fracture, 
paresthesia, alveolar osteitis, temporomandibular joint discomfort, and 
oroantral fistula were reported. Surgical difficulty class VI presented the 
higher incidence of complications (n=38).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of complications in third molar surgery will always exist 
and increases in proportion to the surgical difficulty. Mandibular M3 requiring 
osteotomy and tooth section have the highest risk of complications.

MO 64131.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project was to develop and test protocols for a 
randomized clinical trial of a combined therapeutic approach (thoracic spine and 
sacroiliac joint high-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation [HVLA SM] + 
cervical spine postisometric relaxation) and cervical spine HVLA SM for patients 
with subacute or chronic neck pain.
METHODS: Patients were recruited in the Quad Cities in Iowa and Illinois. After 
a baseline assessment visit, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 
cervical spine HVLA SM or to the combined therapeutic approach for 4 treatment 
visits over 2 weeks. Outcome assessments included the Neck Disability Index, 
visual analog scale, and posttreatment response questionnaire. Patient outcomes 
were not aggregated or compared by treatment group.
RESULTS: It took approximately 8 months of planning, which included the 
development of forms and protocols, pretesting the forms, and training staff and 
clinicians in the standardized protocols. Twelve participants were screened, and 
6 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to care over a 6-week period. 
All patients completed 5 visits. Five of 6 patients had an improvement on the 
Neck Disability Index. On the visual analog scale, 2 patients improved at 2 
weeks, whereas the other 4 got worse. Five patients completed the posttreatment 
response questionnaire; 2 of the 5 indicated they experienced discomfort or an 
unpleasant reaction from the study treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Designing a successful feasibility randomized clinical trial 
requires considerable planning, development and pretesting of the forms and 
protocols, and training clinicians and staff for standardized protocols. 
Patients were willing to be randomized, follow treatment protocols, complete 
baseline and outcome assessments, and return 83% of the follow-up 
questionnaires.

Background The discomfort in the mid-shaft and distal end of the tibia caused by 
shin splints or tibial periostitis also known as medial tibial stress syndrome 
(MTSS) is frequently induced by participating in sports or other strenuous 
activities. The two treatment methods used in this study are the Graston 
technique and cupping therapy; we have compared cupping with the Graston 
technique. Method It was an interventional study at Ravi Nair Physiotherapy 
College and Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital. A total of 46 participants with 
MTSS were included in the study. The participants were randomly divided into two 
groups and treated for three weeks with four weekly sessions. Result Statistical 
analysis was done after the completion of sampling. Paired and unpaired t-tests 
were used. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. The result was 
obtained after comparing the pre and post values of the visual analog scale 
(VAS), treadmill test, step-up and step-down tests, manual muscle testing (MMT), 
and range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint. After three weeks of treatment, 
pain with a p-value of 0.01 S showed a significant effect, and improved 
functions were reduced in the cupping and Graston technique groups. When 
compared, cupping therapy showed better results than the Graston technique. 
Conclusion We saw that the cupping therapy might be better than the Graston 
technique in reducing pain and improving functions.

INTRODUCTION: Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation for more than 
a year resulting from the loss of follicular activity of the ovaries. It is 
manifested by vasomotor, psychological, and urogenital symptoms which can be 
assessed by an internationally accepted scale known as Menopause Rating Scale. 
This study was conducted to find out the issues of perimenopausal women and 
proceed for management and proper counseling.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among women visiting 
the gynecological outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital from June 
2017 to May 2018 using the Menopause Rating Scale. Ethical approval was taken 
from the Institutional Review Committee (reference number: 20122016). Convenient 
sampling was done. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 was 
used for data analysis. Point estimate at 90% confidence interval was calculated 
along with frequency and proportion for binary data.
RESULTS: Out of 189 perimenopausal women interviewed, the mean age of menopause 
was found to be 50.2±2.1 years. The most common gynecological symptoms among the 
study population was abnormal uterine bleeding 66 (34.9%) followed by abnormal 
vaginal discharge 50 (26.5%). Among symptoms in Menopause Rating Scale, the 
depressive mood was found in 99 (52.4%) cases followed by joint and muscular 
discomfort 88 (46.6%) and bladder problems in 87 (46%). None of the women had a 
score on the Menopause Rating Scale more than 16 and did not require management 
for their problem.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the women didn't know menopausal symptoms. However, none 
required intervention from gynecologists for their problems reflecting better 
quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: The complex anatomy and biomechanics of the elbow joint can lead 
to diagnostic uncertainty when a clinician is determining the cause of a 
patient's anterior elbow pain. We present a case of anterior elbow pain with an 
uncommon and often overlooked etiology. Elbow pain due to compression of the 
lateral antebrachial nerve (LACN) has an unknown incidence or prevalence.
CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old left-hand dominant male presented to our orthopedic 
elbow clinic complaining of bilateral elbow clicking and discomfort which had 
been present for several years. His painful symptoms were localized to the 
anterior aspect of both elbows and had slowly become more painful despite simple 
analgesia and physiotherapy. Examination revealed the full range of movement of 
both elbows with no instability or weakness. Plain imaging and magnetic 
resonance imaging scans of both elbows did not reveal any pathology, and the 
decision was made to explore the right elbow, as this was the most symptomatic. 
Under general anesthesia with tourniquet an anterior curvilinear antecubital 
fossa incision was made. The lateral border of the distal biceps tendon showed 
evidence of compression of the LACN at the musculotendinous junction. The tendon 
was partially resected, and the nerve confirmed to move freely without further 
entrapment. At 4 weeks after surgery, he was completely asymptomatic. The 
patient was later listed to undergo a similar procedure to the left side; 
however, he could not go ahead with surgery so far due to work commitment.
CONCLUSION: Entrapment or compression of the LACN is an uncommon and often 
misdiagnosed differential diagnosis with patients presenting with anterior elbow 
pain, which can lead to permanent neurological damage if left untreated. A high 
index of suspicion is required to enable prompt diagnosis and investigation as 
surgical treatment has a high success rate, often with complete resolution of 
symptoms.

Nursing care of blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) patients is complicated. 
Nursing considerations of BMT patients with GVHD require an additional set of 
skills and knowledge that include side effects, both expected and less common, 
assessment skills, treatment administration, both standard and novel, and acute 
or intensive care. Nursing care of BMT patients with skin GVHD will be 
determined by the degree of skin alteration with distinct decisions made about 
hygiene, both topical and systemic treatment, infection prevention, relief of 
discomfort, functional ability (ADL) and body image alteration. The nurse needs 
to have knowledge about assessment criteria for acute and chronic (NIH) 
assessment with special attention to skin (presence of rash, texture, mobility), 
joint mobility, mouth care, dressings, and skin care products. Nursing 
consideration of gastrointestinal GVHD includes importance of accurate intake 
and output, obtaining culture, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, nutrition, 
treatment, and skin care. Complication of GVHD treatment, namely effects of 
steroids require experts from many disciplines to provide comprehensive care. 
Caring and advocating for GVHD patients may include preparing for outcomes that 
are undesirable and impact the patient's quality of life and mortality. BMT 
survivorship programs are a major source of patient education about chronic GVHD 
for patients after treatment. Caring for BMT patients, especially those 
experiencing GVHD, takes a knowledgeable, committed, and caring team of 
healthcare providers. Workshops like this are vital in providing information and 
networking to keep providers around the region and globe engaged in this 
critical work.

The maximal isometric moment at five different elbow joint angles was measured 
in 25 monozygotic and 16 dizygotic male adult twin pairs (22.4 +/- 3.7 yr). 
Genetic model fitting was used to quantify the genetic and environmental 
contributions to individual differences in isometric strength. Additive genetic 
factors explained 66-78% of the variance in maximal torque at 170-140-110 and 80 
degrees flexion (extension = 180 degrees). At 50 degrees flexion, common and 
subject-specific environmental factors contributed equally to the variation. The 
contribution of unique environmental factors concurs with the level of 
variability in muscle activation and (dis)-comfort of torque production in the 
specific angle. The relative contribution of lever arm and force-length 
relationship in torque varies according to the angle. Because these factors 
might be genetic, this variability is reflected in the genetic contribution at 
the extreme angles of 170 and 50 degrees. Multivariate analyses suggested a 
general set of genes that control muscle area and isometric strength, together 
with a more specific strength factor. Genetic correlations were high 
(0.82-0.99). Genes responsible for arm-segment lengths did not contribute to 
muscle area nor to isometric strength.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar spondylolysis and isthmic spondylolisthesis are common 
conditions. However, double-level lumbar spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are 
rare. We report 24 cases of it along with a review of literature and a briefly 
description of the clinical and radiological features and integrated management 
of patients with this condition.
METHODS: Of 1700 inpatients diagnosed with lumbar spondylolisthesis at our 
hospital between January 2008 and September 2015, we selected those with a 
diagnosis of double-level spondylolisthesis who underwent surgery. We analyzed 
the data regarding age, sex, and heavy physical labour. Japanese Orthopaedic 
Association (JOA) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were used to evaluate 
preoperative and postoperative neurological function and back pain. All patients 
underwent decompression, reduction, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) 
with autogenous bone chips from posterior decompression or with a cage. After 
the operation, we were followed up for more than 2 years to observe the effect 
of the operation. In the meantime, the height of the intervertebral discs was 
measured at follow-up, and all data are analyzed in SPSS stastic.
RESULTS: Double-level spondylolisthesis occurred at the L2/L3 and L3/L4 levels 
in one patient, L3/4 and L4/L5 levels in 11 patients, and L4/L5 and L5/S1 levels 
in 12 patients. Nine patients also had spondylolysis. Twenty patients underwent 
posterior lumbar interbody fusion and internal fixation with autologous bone 
chip, and 4 of them underwent cage and autogenous bone graft fixation. 
Postoperatively, the major symptoms (neurological dysfunction and low-back pain) 
improved significantly. Comparison of JOA and VAS scores indicated effective 
recovery of neurological function (p < 0.05). Postoperative follow-up 
demonstrated satisfactory interbody fusion and pars interarticularis healing.
CONCLUSIONS: Double-level lumbar spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis occurred 
more often in women. Most common site of double lumbar spondylolisthesis was 
L3-L5. The treatment principle was the same as that for single-level 
spondylolisthesis, but the reset order is questionable. Both, posterior lumbar 
interbody fusion (PLIF) with autogenous bone chips from posterior decompression 
or with cage can relieve discomfort in most patients. In our follow-up, we found 
that there was a high degree of loss in disk height when autogenous bone was 
used. Therefore, we suggest the use of a cage.

BACKGROUND: Pain after surgery is a major issue for patient discomfort and often 
associated with delayed recovery. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 
the prevalence of pain and requirement for analgesics up to 6 months after 
elective surgery, independent if new pain symptoms occurred after surgery or if 
preoperative pain persisted in the postoperative period.
METHODS: A prospective observational single center cohort study was conducted 
between January 2012 and August 2013. Eligible patients were scheduled to 
undergo elective surgical interventions including joint (hip, knee 
arthroplasty), back (nucleotomy, spondylodesis), or urological surgery 
(cystectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy). Pain was assessed on an 11-point 
numerical rating scale (NRS) before, on postoperative day 2 and 6 months after 
surgery. Clinical information was collected with structured questionnaires and 
by telephone interview.
RESULTS: Six hundred and forty-four patients gave informed consent, including 
54.4 % men (mean age 62.2, SD 14.3). Higher preoperative pain scores were found 
in patients undergoing joint (mean 7.6; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7.2-8.0) 
and back surgery (mean 7.1, CI: 6.8-7.5) than in patients prior to urological 
surgery (mean 2.3; CI: 1.8-2.8). After 6 months, about 50 % of patients after 
joint or back surgery indicated pain levels ≥3/10, compared to 15.9 % of 
patients after urological surgery (p < .001). 35.3 % of the patients after joint 
surgery and 41.3 % after back surgery still use pain medication 6 months 
postoperatively, in contrast to 7.3 % of patients after urological surgery. 
13.6 % of patients who underwent back surgery indicated the regular intake of 
opioids.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that a significant percentage of patients 
undergoing procedures in joint or back surgery still need pain medication up to 
6 months postoperatively due to ongoing pain symptoms. Improved monitoring of 
pain management is warranted, especially after discharge from hospital, to 
improve long-term results.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we created a city-wide database of pharynlaryngeal 
diseases and voice disorders among basic education teachers to analyze the 
incidence, distribution, and risk factors of pharynlaryngeal diseases and voice 
disorders.
METHODS: A total of 47,823 teachers in primary and secondary schools and 
kindergartens of Tianjin were enrolled in this study and underwent 
questionnaires and throat examinations. In addition, the data were subjected to 
descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, and univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Pharynlaryngeal diseases and voice disorders had an overall prevalence 
of 69.42% among basic education teachers in Tianjin, wherein the prevalence of 
chronic pharyngitis, chronic hyperplastic laryngitis, and chronic simple 
laryngitis were the highest at 39.45%, 19.80%, and 15.59%, respectively. The 
results of multivariate logistic regression analysis suggest that 
pharynlaryngeal diseases and voice disorders were statistically correlated with 
gender (P < 0.001), years of teaching (P < 0.001), school district (P < 0.001), 
class size (P < 0.001), subjective assessment of teachers on vocal loudness 
(P < 0.001), neck and shoulder discomfort (P < 0.001), smoking (P < 0.001), 
psychological stress (P = 0.002), and frequent habitual throat clearing 
(P < 0.001). Furthermore, the risk factors for pharynlaryngeal diseases and 
voice disorders were age (P = 0.002), school district (P < 0.001), class size 
(P = 0.008), neck and shoulder discomfort (P = 0.038), smoking (P < 0.001), 
water intake habits during class (P = 0.023), and frequent habitual throat 
clearing (P = 0.001) for male teachers, and for female teachers, it was age 
(P < 0.001), school district (P < 0.001), daily teaching hours (P = 0.005), 
class size (P < 0.001), subjective assessment of teachers on vocal loudness 
(P < 0.001), neck and shoulder discomfort (P < 0.001), smoking (P = 0.033), 
psychological stress (P = 0.003), and frequent habitual throat clearing 
(P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Due to the high prevalence of pharynlaryngeal diseases and voice 
disorders among basic education teachers, throat and voice health 
education-related activities should be conducted for teachers to intervene in 
the occurrence of pharynlaryngeal diseases and voice disorders at an early 
stage.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis of the 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and can often lead to severe pain in the 
orofacial region. Management options for TMJ OA include reassurance, occlusal 
appliances, physical therapy, medication in addition to several surgical 
modalities.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of different surgical and non-surgical 
therapeutic options for the management of TMJ OA in adult patients.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health 
Group Trials Register (to 26 September 2011); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 
2011, Issue 3); MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 26 September 2011); EMBASE via OVID 
(1980 to 26 September 2011); and PEDro (1929 to 26 September 2011). There were 
no language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any form of 
non-surgical or surgical therapy for TMJ OA in adults over the age of 18 with 
clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of TMJ OA according to the Research 
Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) guideline or 
compatible criteria.Primary outcomes considered were pain/tenderness/discomfort 
in the TMJs or jaw muscles, self assessed range of mandibular movement and TMJ 
sounds. Secondary outcomes included the measurement of quality of life or 
patient satisfaction evaluated with a validated questionnaire, morphological 
changes of the TMJs assessed by imaging, TMJ sounds assessed by auscultation and 
any adverse effects.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened and extracted 
information and data from, and independently assessed the risk of bias in the 
included trials.
MAIN RESULTS: Although three RCTs were included in this review, pooling of data 
in a meta-analysis was not possible due to wide clinical diversity between the 
studies. The reports indicate a not dissimilar degree of effectiveness with 
intra-articular injections consisting of either sodium hyaluronate or 
corticosteroid preparations, and an equivalent pain reduction with diclofenac 
sodium as compared with occlusal splints. Glucosamine appeared to be just as 
effective as ibuprofen for the management of TMJ OA.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In view of the paucity of high level evidence for the 
effectiveness of interventions for the management of TMJ OA, small parallel 
group RCTs which include participants with a clear diagnosis of TMJ OA should be 
encouraged and especially studies evaluating some of the possible surgical 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: In patients with hemophilia (PwH), bleeding often occurs in joints 
and muscles, and early detection of hemorrhage is important to prevent the onset 
and progression of mobility impairment. Complex-Image analysis such as 
ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are used to 
detect bleeding. On the other hand, no simple and rapid method to detect the 
active bleeding has been reported. Local inflammatory responses occur when blood 
leaks from damaged vessels, and the temperature at the site of active bleeding 
could be expected to increase in these circumstances, leading to an increase in 
surrounding skin temperature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 
investigate whether the measurement of skin temperature using infrared 
thermography (IRT) can be used as a diagnostic aid to detect active bleeding.
METHODS: Fifteen PwH (from 6 to 82 years old) complaining of discomfort such as 
pain were examined. Thermal images were obtained simultaneously at the affected 
sides and comparable unaffected sides. The average skin temperature of the 
affected side and of the unaffected side were measured. The temperature 
differences were calculated by subtracting the average skin temperature at the 
unaffected side from the affected side.
RESULTS: In eleven cases with active bleeding, the skin temperature at the 
affected side was more than 0.3 °C higher (0.3 °C to 1.4 °C) compared to the 
unaffected side. In two cases without active bleeding, there were no significant 
differences in skin temperature between the affected and unaffected sides. In 
two cases with previous rib or thumb bone fracture, the skin temperature at the 
affected side was 0.3 °C or 0.4 °C lower than that of the unaffected side, 
respectively. In two cases with active bleeding in which longitudinal evaluation 
was conducted, the difference in skin temperature decreased after hemostatic 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: The analysis of skin temperature deference using IRT was a useful 
supportive tool to readily assess musculoskeletal abnormalities and bleeding in 
PwH as well as to determine the success of the hemostatic treatment.

BACKGROUND: Clear visibility of the needle and catheter tip is desirable to 
perform safe and successful ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks. This can 
be challenging with deeper blocks in obese patients. This study compared the 
visibility of echogenic and non-echogenic block needles and catheters in 
proximal sciatic blocks when performed with a low-frequency curved probe.
METHODS: Seventy-eight patients undergoing total knee joint arthroplasty were 
randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided continuous sciatic nerve block using 
either a non-echogenic needle and stimulating catheter or an echogenic needle 
and echogenic non-stimulating catheter. Block needles in both groups were placed 
using both neurostimulation and ultrasound guidance, after which the catheter 
was positioned using either neurostimulation alone (Stimulating group) or 
imaging alone (Echogenic group). Three anaesthetists blinded to group allocation 
graded video clips recorded during the blocks for nerve, needle and catheter 
visibility. Performance characteristics and block parameters were also compared.
RESULTS: No significant differences between the two groups were observed with 
regard to needle or catheter visibility (P=0.516). The Stimulating group 
required more needle redirections (P=0.009), had a longer procedure time 
[Echogenic median 274 s vs Stimulating 344 s (P=0.016)], and resulted in greater 
patient discomfort (P=0.012). There were no significant differences between the 
two groups in terms of block onset or completion time.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of echogenic needles and catheters reduced procedure time and 
patient discomfort compared with a stimulating catheter system. There were no 
differences in the visibility scores of the two systems.

BACKGROUND: Pre-clinical simulation-based training (SBT) in endoscopy has been 
shown to augment trainee performance in the short-term, but longer-term data are 
lacking.
AIM: To assess the impact of a two-day gastroscopy induction course combining 
theory and SBT (Structured PRogramme of INduction and Training - SPRINT) on 
trainee outcomes over a 16-mo period.
METHODS: This prospective case-control study compared outcomes between novice 
SPRINT attendees and controls matched from a United Kingdom training database. 
Study outcomes comprised: (1) Unassisted D2 intubation rates; (2) Procedural 
discomfort scores; (3) Sedation practice; (4) Time to 200 procedures; and (5) 
Time to certification.
RESULTS: Total 15 cases and 24 controls were included, with mean procedure 
counts of 10 and 3 (P = 0.739) pre-SPRINT. Post-SPRINT, no significant 
differences between the groups were detected in long-term D2 intubation rates (P 
= 0.332) or discomfort scores (P = 0.090). However, the cases had a 
significantly higher rate of unsedated procedures than controls post-SPRINT (58% 
vs 44%, P = 0.018), which was maintained over the subsequent 200 procedures. 
Cases tended to perform procedures at a greater frequency than controls in the 
post-SPRINT period (median: 16.2 vs 13.8 per mo, P = 0.051), resulting in a 
significantly greater proportion of cases achieving gastroscopy certification by 
the end of follow up (75% vs 36%, P = 0.017).
CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, attendees of the SPRINT cohort tended to 
perform more procedures and achieved gastroscopy certification earlier than 
controls. These data support the role for wider evaluation of pre-clinical 
induction involving SBT.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to perform a pattern analysis in 
patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) resulting from unilateral 
mastication due to chronic periodontitis.
METHODS: Thirty participants with signs or symptoms of TMD who engaged in 
unilateral mastication due to periodontitis-related discomfort (test group) were 
selected. Another 30 subjects exhibiting signs or symptoms of TMD resulting from 
unilateral mastication not due to chronic periodontitis (control group) were 
also recruited. An interview-based questionnaire was administered, and an 
examination of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) with determination of 
periodontal status was performed.
RESULTS: The duration of unilateral mastication was significantly longer in the 
control group than in the test group. There was a significant negative 
correlation between the duration of unilateral mastication and the Community 
Periodontal Index score. Using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD 
(RDC/TMD) axis I algorithms, all the subjects were assigned to 3 main groups. 
The test group exhibited significantly a higher diagnostic distribution of group 
III (arthralgia, osteoarthritis, or osteoarthrosis), and in both the test and 
control groups, the number of diagnoses was larger for the non-chewing side. The 
control group showed a significantly higher diagnostic distribution of group I 
(myofacial pain), and in both the test and control groups, the number of 
diagnoses was larger for the chewing side.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that unilateral 
mastication due to chronic periodontitis could induce not only pain but also 
structural TMJ changes if adequate treatment is not administered and supported 
within a short time from the onset of the condition. Therefore, immediate 
treatment of chronic periodontitis is recommended to prevent not only the 
primary progress of periodontal disease, but also secondary TMJ-related 
problems. Furthermore, subjects who have suffered chronic long-term 
periodontitis without treatment should be urged to undergo a TMJ examination.

INTRODUCTION: Elite military trainees are burdened by high numbers of 
musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and are a priority military population for injury 
prevention. This research aims to describe the MSK complaint epidemiology of 
trainees undertaking special forces (SF) training in the Australian Defence 
Force (ADF). One barrier to accurate injury surveillance in military populations 
is that traditional surveillance methods rely on personnel engaging with the 
military healthcare system to collect injury data. This approach is likely to 
underestimate the injury burden as it is known that many military personnel, 
particularly trainees, avoid reporting their injuries because of various 
motives. Subsequently, the insights from surveillance systems may underestimate 
the injury burden and limit the ability to inform prevention requirements. This 
research aims to actively seek MSK complaint information directly from trainees 
in a sensitive manner to mediate injury-reporting behaviors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive epidemiology study included two 
consecutive cohorts of ADF SF trainees from 2019 to 2021. Musculoskeletal data 
items and their respective recording methods were based on international sports 
injury surveillance guidelines and adapted to a military context. Our case 
definition encompassed all injuries or physical discomforts as recordable cases. 
A unit-embedded physiotherapist retrospectively collected MSK complaint data 
from selection courses and collected prospective data over the training 
continuum. Data collection processes were external to the military health care 
system to mediate reporting avoidance and encourage injury reporting. Injury 
proportions, complaint incidence rates, and incidence rate ratios were 
calculated and compared between training courses and cohorts.
RESULTS: In total, 334 MSK complaints were reported by 103 trainees (90.4%), 
with a complaint incidence rate of 58.9 per 1,000 training weeks (95% 
CI, 53.0-65.5). Of these MSK complaints, 6.4% (n = 22) resulted in time loss 
from work. The lumbar spine (20.6%, n = 71) and the knee (18.9%, n = 65) were 
the most frequently affected body parts. Most of the MSK complaints were 
reported during selection courses (41.9%), followed by field survival and team 
tactics (23.0%) and urban operations courses (21.9%). Physical training 
accounted for 16.5% of complaints. Fast-roping training was associated with more 
severe MSK complaints.
CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal complaints are highly prevalent in ADF SF trainees. 
Complaints are more frequently reported in selection and qualification training 
courses than in physical training. These activities are priorities for focused 
research to understand injury circumstances in ADF elite training programs to 
inform injury prevention strategies. A strength of our study is the data 
collection methods which have provided greater MSK complaint information than 
past research; however, much work remains in conducting consistent and accurate 
surveillance. Another strength is the use of an embedded physiotherapist to 
overcome injury-reporting avoidance. Embedded health professionals are 
recommended as continued practice for ongoing surveillance and early 
intervention.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of arthrocentesis 
followed by hyaluronic acid infiltration treatment (ASH) and mandibular exercise 
therapy (MET) in patients with symptomatic disc displacement without reduction 
(DDwoR) by examining pain intensity (VAS), mandibular range of motion (MO), and 
quality of life (QoL). Fifty-two patients were randomly allocated into two 
groups, MET (N = 26) and ASH (N = 26), and therapy was applied at the baseline 
and one month after. Patients were followed up at 1 and 12 months after the 
baseline assessment. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were compared at the 
baseline, 1-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. The study found no 
significant differences in VAS and MO between the ASH and MET groups at the 
baseline. However, while not significant, it was noted that the ASH group showed 
higher values for MO. Regarding OHIP-14 at 1 month of follow-up, the ASH group 
showed significant improvements in physical pain (p > 0.01), physical and 
psychological disability (p = 0.043 and p = 0.029), and handicap (p = 0.033). At 
the 12-month follow-up, the ASH group showed significant improvements in 
functional limitation, psychological discomfort, psychological disability, and 
handicap (p = 0.008, p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.005, respectively). ASH 
treatment did not reduce pain or improve mandibular range of motion more than 
physical therapy in patients with symptomatic DDwoR. However, ASH could be 
preferable given its positive long-term effects on patients' quality of life. 
The clinician's main objective is to prioritize the treatment plan order with a 
focus on the patient's quality of life. Accordingly, healthcare professionals 
should consider ASH as a treatment option for patients with symptomatic DDwoR 
who desire long-term improvement in their quality of life.

PURPOSE: Eccentric muscle actions generate high levels of force at a low 
metabolic cost, making them a suitable training modality to combat age-related 
neuromuscular decline. The temporary muscle soreness associated with high 
intensity eccentric contractions may explain their limited use in clinical 
exercise prescription, however any discomfort is often alleviated after the 
initial bout (repeated bout effect). Therefore, the aims of the present study 
were to examine the acute and repeated bout effects of eccentric contractions on 
neuromuscular factors associated with the risk of falling in older adults.
METHODS: Balance, functional ability [timed up-and-go and sit-to-stand], and 
lower-limb maximal and explosive strength were measured in 13 participants 
(67.6 ± 4.9 year) pre- and post-eccentric exercise (0, 24, 48, and 72 hr) in 
Bout 1 and 14 days later in Bout 2. The eccentric exercise intervention was 
performed on an isokinetic unilateral stepper ergometer at 50% of maximal 
eccentric strength at 18 step‧min-1 per limb for 7 min (126 steps per limb). 
Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to identify any significant 
effects (P ≤ 0.05).
RESULTS: Eccentric strength significantly decreased (- 13%) in Bout 1 at 24 hr 
post-exercise; no significant reduction was observed at any other time-point 
after Bout 1. No significant reductions occurred in static balance or functional 
ability at any time-point in either bout.
CONCLUSION: Submaximal multi-joint eccentric exercise results in minimal 
disruption to neuromuscular function associated with falls in older adults after 
the initial bout.

AIM: The aim of this article is to estimate prevalence of menopausal symptoms 
among women in the menopausal age group and study the urban-rural differences.
METHODS AND DESIGN: Analytical cross-sectional study conducted in rural and 
urban field practice areas of a tertiary care center affiliated to Medical 
College, where 290 women (145 each from urban and rural areas) were interviewed 
to measure prevalence of menopausal symptoms. Forty-one symptoms were divided 
into 'Psycho-somatic' (17 symptoms), 'genito-urinary (9 symptoms)' and 
musculo-skeletal (5 symptoms) domains. The prevalence of each of these symptoms 
is reported as proportion and the differences in the median scores in the two 
groups were tested using Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: From among 145 women each, in urban and rural settings, most common 
psychosomatic symptoms were physical exhaustion-fatigue (73.1%), difficulty 
climbing stairs (59.3%), sleep problems (45.2%), body ache (43.4%), and hot 
flushes (41.4%). Among the urban participants, most common was physical 
exhaustion (42.1%), difficulty climbing stairs (62.1%), anger (46.9%), sleep 
problems (45.5%), and irritability (42.1%), while among the rural participants 
they were physical exhaustion (66.2%), difficulty climbing stairs (56.6%), 
insomnia (54.5%), and body ache (46.2%). Most common genito-urinary symptoms 
overall and in rural areas were urinary urgency (35.9% and 38.6%), increased 
frequency of urine (31.7% and 37.2%) and incontinence (30% and 35.2% 
respectively). Among the urban women, common symptoms were urinary urgency 
(33.1%) followed by itching of private parts (30.3%) and increased frequency of 
urination (26.2%). Among musculo-skeletal symptoms, joint pain (74.1%, 74.5%, 
73.8%) was the most common symptom followed by joint and muscular discomfort 
(71.7%, 73.8%, 69.7%) among the overall, urban and rural participants. There was 
a significant difference in the median psychosomatic score as per the symptoms 
experienced by the urban and rural participants (U = 36, Z statistic = 2.31, and 
P = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference in the scores for 
genito-urinary and musculo-skeletal symptoms; thereby, median scores under both 
these domains were almost similar in both urban and rural groups.
CONCLUSION: There was significant difference in the median psychosomatic score 
as per the symptoms experienced by the urban and rural participants however; 
there was no significant difference in genito-urinary and musculo-skeletal 
symptom scores.

Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis worldwide 
and is characterized by the gradual loss of joint cartilage, leading to 
stiffness, discomfort, and restricted movement. This research aims to assess the 
knowledge of obese women in the Aseer region regarding OA and its associated 
risk factors. OA predominantly affects the knees, hands, and hips, with knee OA 
being particularly significant due to its high incidence rate and early onset in 
obese women. In Saudi Arabia, there are varying levels of awareness among the 
population, but no study has focused on obese females. This study seeks to 
address this gap and enhance the understanding of OA in this demographic. 
Methodology A cross-sectional research design was employed using a 
self-administrated questionnaire collected by a group of trained data collectors 
who distributed the questionnaires throughout the clinics of Aseer central 
hospital. The questionnaire was divided into two sections. The first section 
collected demographic data about the participants, and the second section was a 
20-item questionnaire about OA and its related risk factors. The study was 
conducted in the Aseer region. A total of 278 subjects (female) were included in 
the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27.0.1.0 (IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results This study analyzed the sociodemographic 
characteristics of 278 participants. All participants were female, were young to 
middle-aged adults, and had a collegiate education. On average, participants 
were overweight, with varying knowledge levels about OA. While some correctly 
identified symptoms and risk factors. Many participants responded with "I Don't 
Know" regarding joint stiffness as a symptom (37.7%). Comparing knowledge among 
different body mass index groups revealed no significant differences, except for 
misconceptions about the cause of OA among overweight individuals (39.06%). 
Conclusions This study's findings underscore the practical implications for 
patient education and healthcare strategies. The varying levels of awareness 
among obese women in the Aseer region regarding OA emphasize the need for 
increased education and targeted health promotion interventions. Addressing 
misconceptions and improving knowledge can enhance treatment plans and 
contribute to better patient outcomes. Understanding these knowledge gaps is 
crucial for improving patient education, healthcare strategies, and OA 
management.

BACKGROUND: Distal clavicular fracture is a shoulder joint injury that is common 
in clinical settings and is generally surgically treated using the clavicular 
hook plate technique with a confirmed curative effect. However, symptoms, such 
as shoulder abduction limitation, shoulder discomfort, and postoperative joint 
pain, may occur in some patients. To overcome these problems, after a previous 
study we developed an acromial height-measuring device and a new type of 
clavicular hook plate. This study aimed to investigate whether an acromial 
height-measuring device combined with an improved new-type clavicular hook plate 
can better reduce the incidence of complications and improve postoperative 
function. To provide patients with better treatment effects, an acromion gauge 
and clavicular hook plate are used.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 81 patients with distal 
clavicular fractures admitted to our hospital. They were divided into 
experimental and control groups according to different plates, and the 
Constant-Murley score, visual analogue scale score, incidence of acromion 
osteolysis, and incidence of subacromial impingement syndrome were compared.
RESULTS: Compared with the standard clavicular hook plate, the acromial 
height-measuring device combined with the new-type clavicular hook plate in the 
treatment of distal clavicle fractures has a lower incidence of subacromial 
impingement syndrome with better postoperative functional recovery and quality 
of life.
CONCLUSIONS: We considered the acromial height-measuring device combined with 
the new clavicular hook plate to be a safe and promising alternative to distal 
clavicular fractures.

PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of photobiomodulation combined with orofacial 
myofunctional therapy (OMT) on the oral health quality of life (OHQOL) of 
individuals with temporomandibular disorder, before and after the treatment.
METHODS: Blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial with 34 volunteers 
randomly distributed into two groups: G1, who received OMT combined with 
photobiomodulation, and G2, treated with OMT combined with inactive laser. The 
subjects were first assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS) to classify them 
according to the degree of orofacial pain and with the Oral Health Impact 
Profile - Short Form (OHIP-14) regarding the impact on the OHQOL. The resulting 
data were statistically analyzed. The significance level was set at 0.05 (95%).
RESULTS: "Physical pain", "psychological discomfort", "physical disability", and 
"psychological disability" were the aspects with the greatest impact on the 
OHQOL. The G1 subjects responded positively to their treatment, as well as G2 to 
theirs. There was a strong positive correlation between VAS and total OHIP-14 
score in both groups after the treatment. However, the functional recovery in 
the control group individuals (G2) was the most perceived positive change in the 
OHQOL in comparison with the experimental group (G1).
CONCLUSION: The people who received photobiomodulation combined with OMT 
perceived an improvement in the OHQOL, as well as those treated with placebo 
laser. There was a strong positive correlation in both groups in the improvement 
of the degree of pain and self-perception of the OHQOL.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Analisar o impacto na qualidade de vida relacionada à saúde 
oral de indivíduos com disfunção temporomandibular, antes e após o tratamento de 
fotobiomodulação associada a terapia miofuncional orofacial.
MÉTODO: Estudo do tipo ensaio clínico randomizado, controlado e cego, com 34 
voluntários distribuídos aleatoriamente em dois grupos: G1, que recebeu a 
Terapia Miofuncional Orofacial (TMO) associada a fotobiomodulação e o G2, 
tratado pela TMO associada ao laser inativo. Os indivíduos foram submetidos, 
primeiramente, à avaliação para serem classificados de acordo com o grau da dor 
orofacial pela Escala Visual Analógica (EVA) e também quanto ao impacto da 
qualidade de vida relacionada a saúde oral (QVRSO) pelo questionário Oral Health 
Impact Profile – Short form (OHIP-14). Os dados obtidos foram analisados 
estatisticamente. Foi adotado o nível de significância de 0,05 (95%).
RESULTADOS: “Dor física”, “desconforto psicológico”, “limitação física” e 
“limitação psicológica” foram os aspectos mais impactantes na QVRSO. O G1 
apresentou respostas positivas para o respectivo tratamento, assim como o G2. 
Observou-se correlação positiva e de grau forte para EVA e escore total do 
OHIP-14 em ambos os grupos após tratamento. Porém, os indivíduos do grupo 
controle (G2) evidenciaram que a recuperação funcional foi o aspecto que mais se 
percebeu de mudança positiva na QVRSO em comparação ao grupo experimental (G1).
CONCLUSÃO: As pessoas que receberam fotobiomodulação associada a TMO-perceberam 
melhora da QVRSO, assim como as tratadas com o laser placebo. Houve correlação 
positiva e forte em ambos os grupos na melhora do grau da dor e autopercepção da 
QVRSO.

BACKGROUND: Rapid ethical access to personal health information (PHI) to support 
research is extremely important during pandemics, yet little is known regarding 
patient preferences for consent during such crises. This follow-up study sought 
to ascertain whether there were differences in consent preferences between 
pre-pandemic times compared to during Wave 1 of the COVID-19 global pandemic, 
and to better understand the reasons behind these preferences.
METHODS: A total of 183 patients in the pandemic cohort completed the survey via 
email, and responses were compared to the distinct pre-pandemic cohort 
(n = 222); all were patients of a large Canadian cancer center. The survey 
covered (a) broad versus study-specific consent; (b) opt-in versus opt-out 
contact approach; (c) levels of comfort sharing with different recipients; (d) 
perceptions of commercialization; and (e) options to track use of information 
and be notified of results. Four focus groups (n = 12) were subsequently 
conducted to elucidate reasons motivating dominant preferences.
RESULTS: Patients in the pandemic cohort were significantly more comfortable 
with sharing all information and biological samples (90% vs. 79%, p = 0.009), 
sharing information with the health care institution (97% vs. 83%, p < 0.001), 
sharing information with researchers at other hospitals (85% vs. 70%, 
p < 0.001), sharing PHI provincially (69% vs. 53%, p < 0.002), nationally (65% 
vs. 53%, p = 0.022) and internationally (48% vs. 39%, p = 0.024) compared to the 
pre-pandemic cohort. Discomfort with sharing information with commercial 
companies remained unchanged between the two cohorts (50% vs. 51% uncomfortable, 
p = 0.58). Significantly more pandemic cohort patients expressed a wish to track 
use of PHI (75% vs. 61%, p = 0.007), and to be notified of results (83% vs. 70%, 
p = 0.012). Thematic analysis uncovered that transparency was strongly desired 
on outside PHI use, particularly when commercialization was involved.
CONCLUSIONS: In pandemic times, patients were more comfortable sharing 
information with all parties, except with commercial entities, where levels of 
discomfort (~ 50%) remained unchanged. Focus groups identified that the ability 
to track and receive results of studies using one's PHI is an important way to 
reduce discomfort and increase trust. These findings meaningfully inform wider 
discussions on the use of personal health information for research during global 
crises.

Millions of people were infected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, 
which left a huge burden on the care of post COVID-19 survivors around the 
globe. The self-reported COVID-19 symptoms were experienced by an estimated 1.3 
million people in the United Kingdom (2% of the population), and these symptoms 
persisted for about 4 weeks from the beginning of the infection. The symptoms 
most frequently reported were exhaustion, shortness of breath, muscular 
discomfort, joint pain, headache, cough, chest pain, cognitive impairment, 
memory loss, anxiety, sleep difficulties, diarrhea, and a decreased sense of 
smell and taste in post-COVID-19 affected people. The post COVID-19 
complications were frequently related to the respiratory, cardiac, nervous, 
psychological and musculoskeletal systems. The lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, 
brain and other organs had been impaired by hypoxia and inflammation in post 
COVID-19 individuals. The upregulation of substance "P" (SP) and various 
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), 
interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) and chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3) has muddled respiratory, 
cardiac, neuropsychiatric, dermatological, endocrine, musculoskeletal, 
gastrointestinal, renal and genitourinary complications in post COVID-19 people. 
To prevent these complications from worsening, it was therefore important to 
study how these biomarkers were upregulated and block their receptors.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Netherlands has National Indication Protocols on 
proton therapy (PT) to select patients who benefit most from PT. However, 
referrals to proton therapy centres (PTCs) are lagging. The objective of this 
research is to identify the barriers for access to PT and to design 
interventions to address these barriers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey among radiation 
oncologists (ROs), and semi- structured in-depth interviews with ROs and 
patients. Subsequently, four workshops were held, in which ROs from one PTC and 
ROs from referring hospitals participated. The workshops were based on 
design-thinking research, where ideas were co-created on a multidisciplinary 
basis to encourage joint problem ownership. Kruskal Wallis and X2 tests were 
used to analyze data.
RESULTS: The most prominent barriers mentioned by ROs were patient selection, 
poor logistics, and logistical worries about the combination of radiation 
treatment with chemotherapy. Patients pointed out the inefficient coordination 
between organisations, poor communication, travel issues and discomfort during 
treatment. Clues to increase referrals revealed the need for additional tools 
for patient selection and innovative ways to improve logistics. A case manager 
was identified as beneficial to the patients' journey as part of a 
multidisciplinary approach. Such an approach should include the active 
involvement of medical oncologists, surgeons and pulmonologists.
CONCLUSION: Barriers for access to PT were identified and prioritized in the 
inter-organisational care- pathway of proton therapy patients in The 
Netherlands. Innovative solutions were co- designed to solve the barriers.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has severely affected UK endoscopy services with an 
estimate 86% loss of activity during the first wave. Subsequent delays in 
diagnostic and surveillance procedures highlight the need for novel solutions to 
tackle the resultant backlog. Transnasal endoscopy (TNE) provides an attractive 
option compared with conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscopy given its 
limited use of space, no sedation and reduced nursing resources.
OUR EXPERIENCE: We describe piloting and then establishing an outpatient model 
TNE service in the pandemic era and the implications on resource allocation, 
training and workforce. We also discuss our experiences and outline ways in 
which services can evolve to undertake more complex endoscopic diagnostic and 
therapeutic work. Over 90% of patients describe no discomfort and those who have 
previously experienced conventional transoral endoscopy preferred the transnasal 
approach. We describe a low complication rate (0.8%) comprising two episodes of 
mild epistaxis. The average procedure duration was reasonable (9.9±5.0 min) with 
full adherence to Joint Advisory Group quality standards. All biopsies assessed 
were deemed sufficient for diagnosis including those for surveillance 
procedures.
DISCUSSION: TNE can offer a safe, tolerable, high-quality service outside of a 
conventional endoscopy setting. Expanding procedural capacity without impacting 
on the current endoscopy footprint has great potential in recovering endoscopy 
services following the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking forward, TNE has potential to 
be used both within the endoscopy suite as part of therapeutic procedures, or 
outside of the endoscopy unit in outpatient clinics, community hospitals, or 
mobile units and to achieve this in a more sustainable and environmentally 
friendly way.

Orthokeratology lenses are commonly used for myopia control, especially in 
children. Tear lipids and proteins are immediately adsorbed when the lens is put 
on the cornea, and protein deposition may cause discomfort or infection. 
Therefore, we established an in vitro protein deposition analysis by mimicking 
the current cleaning methods for orthokeratology lens wearers for both 
short-term and long-term period. The results showed that the amounts of tear 
proteins accumulated daily and achieved a balance after 14 days when the lens 
was rubbed to clean or not. Protein deposition also affected the optical 
characteristics of the lens regardless of cleaning methods. Our results provided 
an in vitro analysis for protein deposition on the lens, and they may provide a 
potential effective method for developing care solutions or methods that can 
more effectively remove tear components from orthokeratology lenses.

PURPOSE: The region of the index finger metacarpophalangeal joint is a common 
source of hand pain with variable, well-known etiologies. We have identified the 
tubercle at the dorsoradial neck of the index finger metacarpal as a distinct 
and specific site of pain in a subset of patients who presented with a chief 
report of index finger pain. Although experienced hand surgeons may recognize 
this clinical entity, we found no previous description within the literature.
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective 
review of all patients presenting to a single surgeon practice with severe pain 
at the dorsoradial tubercle of the index finger metacarpal unattributable to 
known etiologies. Patients underwent initial management of steroid injection 
followed by surgical excision if conservative measures failed.
RESULTS: Steroid injection was administered as initial management in 9 of 10 
afflicted hands. Five of these hands experienced complete resolution of pain at 
4 weeks after injection whereas 4 developed recurrence at an average of 3 months 
after injection. Among patients with recurrence, one patient opted for a second 
injection that led to pain resolution 4 weeks later, whereas the remaining 3 
hands had surgical excision. All patients who underwent surgical excision 
reported minimal discomfort and marked improvement in pain after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the tubercle at the dorsoradial neck of the index 
finger metacarpal as a distinct and specific site of pain in a subset of 
patients. We postulate that the pathophysiology of pain at the prominent index 
finger metacarpal tubercle may be related to a subacute radial collateral 
ligament injury. Steroid injection to the tubercle is a reasonable initial 
treatment option and satisfactory results may also be obtained with surgical 
excision.

INTRODUCTION: Menopausal symptoms experienced by women are known to affect their 
quality-of-life. The symptoms experienced at menopause are quite variable and 
their etiology is found to be multifactorial. This study was hence done to 
assess the pattern and severity of menopausal symptoms and to find out the 
factors associated with these symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in various 
outreach clinics of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. Women in the age group 
of 40-65 years were included in the study by convenient sampling method. Data 
regarding menopausal symptom was obtained by interviewing each participant using 
the menopause rating scale questionnaire.
RESULTS: Mean age of the participants were 54.2 ± 7.2 years and mean age of 
attainment of menopause was 48.4 ± 4.5 years. Mean duration of menopause was 
found to be 7.5 ± 5.3 years. Commonest symptom reported was joint and muscular 
discomfort and physical and mental exhaustion seen in 94 (85.4%) participants. 
The mean number of symptoms reported by participants was 7.6 ± 2.8. Educated 
women reported significantly more symptoms (F = 2.218, P = 0.047). Somatic and 
urogenital symptoms were more among perimenopausal women and somatic symptoms 
were more among postmenopausal women. Fifty-eight (52.7%) participants had one 
or more severe symptoms. Severe symptoms were most among premenopausal women.
CONCLUSION: The high proportion and severity of menopausal symptoms observed in 
this study group proves that menopausal symptoms are common and cannot be 
ignored. More of menopausal clinics are needed for awareness generation, early 
recognition and treatment of related morbidities.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is defined as repeated 
episodes of obstruction of the upper airway and oxygen desaturation of the 
arterial hemoglobin. OSAS is associated with loud snoring, excessive daytime 
sleepiness, cardiovascular and neurocognitive disease, increase risk of road 
accidents.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate non-surgical therapy for OSAS using a 
mandibular advancement device (MAD) that provides for lower jaw protrusion and 
for an adequate vertical opening, that allows for greater airflow.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The device was assembled using the working principles of 
"Herbst-like" appliances and splints of neuromuscular deprogramming of the 
"Federici" type used for gnathologic treatments. We selected 17 males and 4 
females, with an average age of 42 years, and an average BMI of 29. Eighteen 
patients were treated with our oral appliance, 1 patient was treated with the 
orthesis proposed by Schmidt-Nowara et al and 2 patients were treated with the 
oral appliance proposed by Johal and Battagel. All patients used the appliance 
for at least 6 months.
RESULTS: After treatment with the oral appliance, the posterior airway space 
increased (p = 0.0002); no statistically significant difference for the 
improvement degree of OSAS severity (p = 0.1085) was shown; an improvement was 
found in: AHI (p = 0.0028); Nadir O2 (p = 0.0035); TO2 < 90% (p = 0.0140); 2 
patients presented with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our MAD has proved effective in improving the polysomnographic and 
radiographic parameters and assures good TMJ compliance.

BACKGROUND: High resistance training enhances muscular strength, and recent work 
has suggested an important role for metabolite accumulation in this process.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of fatigue and metabolite accumulation in 
strength gains by comparing highly fatiguing and non-fatiguing isotonic training 
protocols.
METHODS: Twenty three healthy adults (18-29 years of age; eight women) were 
assigned to either a high fatigue protocol (HF: four sets of 10 repetitions with 
30 seconds rest between sets) to maximise metabolic stress or a low fatigue 
protocol (LF: 40 repetitions with 30 seconds between each repetition) to 
minimise changes. Subjects lifted on average 73% of their 1 repetition maximum 
through the full range of knee extension with both legs, three times a week. 
Quadriceps isometric strength of each leg was measured at a knee joint angle of 
1.57 rad (90 degrees ), and a Cybex 340 isokinetic dynamometer was used to 
measure the angle-torque and torque-velocity relations of the non-dominant leg.
RESULTS: At the mid-point of the training, the HF group had 50% greater gains in 
isometric strength, although this was not significant (4.5 weeks: HF, 13.3 
(4.4)%; LF, 8.9 (3.6)%). This rate of increase was not sustained by the HF 
group, and after nine weeks of training all the strength measurements showed 
similar improvements for both groups (isometric strength: HF, 18.2 (3.9)%; LF, 
14.5 (4.0)%). The strength gains were limited to the longer muscle lengths 
despite training over the full range of movement.
CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and metabolite accumulation do not appear to be critical 
stimuli for strength gain, and resistance training can be effective without the 
severe discomfort and acute physical effort associated with fatiguing 
contractions.

A boy aged 4 years with nephrotic syndrome (NS) was referred to our hospital 
because of the third relapse of NS. Hypogammaglobulinemia associated with 
massive proteinuria was observed at the presentation. Residual urinary tract 
infection required intravenous piperacillin and immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG). 
Soon after IVIG, he complained of high fever with chills, bilateral knee joint 
pain, dry cough and chest discomfort. Although he did not develop renal 
insufficiency, a transient increase in the urinary beta2-microglobulin and 
decrease in the serum complement hemolytic activity were observed. These 
clinical manifestations spontaneously ceased. A percutaneous renal biopsy for 
his NS performed 19 days after the episode of allergic reaction revealed 
tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) with marked eosinophil infiltrates. Glomeruli 
showed minor glomerular abnormalities. Renal complications associated with IVIG 
treatment have been reported to date, however, acute TIN has rarely been seen.

AIM: This study examines the effects of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) on 
the oral health and detectability of inflammatory biomarkers IL-17, tumour 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and total antioxidant status (TAS) in the saliva 
of children with JIA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 117 participants (39 patients with JIA 
and 78 systemically healthy subjects aged 8-12 years). Demographic data, 
responses to an oral health-related questionnaire, saliva samples, periodontal 
parameters [plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and bleeding on probing 
(BOP)] and dental recordings [facial profile (FP) and dental occlusion 
relationship (DOR)] were obtained. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used 
to determine the levels of salivary IL-17, TNF-α and TAS.
RESULTS: The Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment (CAST) index, FP and DOR 
distributions did not change between groups (P > 0.05). JIA patients had more 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discomfort than gingivitis patients and healthy 
subjects (P < 0.05). JIA patients had greater salivary IL-17 levels than healthy 
subjects (P < 0.05). The healthy group's TAS was higher than that of the JIA and 
gingivitis groups (P < 0.05). Saliva TNF-α levels were similar between groups (P 
> 0.05). PI, GI, BOP and TNF-α were positively associated with salivary IL-17 (P 
< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated salivary IL-17 and TAS levels could be used as biological 
markers for discriminating the clinical health status of children with JIA and 
gingivitis.

BACKGROUND: Complementary medicine (CM) is gaining popularity worldwide. 
According to the 2019 World Health Organization global report on traditional and 
complementary medicine (T&CM), 80% of member states acknowledged practicing 
T&CM. In the United Arab Emirates, T&CM practice prevalence in 2012 was 20-39%. 
These trends highlight physicians' need for knowledge on CM, such as cupping 
therapy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess knowledge, practice, and attitude toward 
cupping therapy (CT) among physicians in Sheikh Khalifa medical city (SKMC).
METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2020 to March 
2021 among the physicians of SKMC. The survey was carried out using an online 
questionnaire. The questionnaire included four sections: socio-demographics, 
knowledge of physicians toward cupping therapy, physicians' attitude toward 
cupping therapy, and physicians' practice toward cupping therapy. SPSS version 
28 was used for data analysis. Data were reported in frequencies and 
percentages. A P value of <0.05 is the level of statistical significance.
RESULTS: The response rate was 83%. Among the 154 participants, 67.5% had 
adequate knowledge of CT, 66.9% showed a positive attitude, and 31.2% reported 
good practice toward CT. Individuals below 40 years reported significantly 
lesser knowledge than individuals over 40 years (p = 0.035, OR 0.49 
[0.246-0.998]). Over 80% of physicians concur that cupping therapy can be used 
to treat and manage low back pain, joint discomfort, headache, migraine, and 
anxiety. The majority of physicians believe that education regarding cupping 
therapy is required.
CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians had adequate knowledge and a positive attitude 
toward cupping therapy.

Background: Physical activity (PA) is a behavioral modality that may help 
decrease negative symptoms of menopause and enhance some positive aspects of 
mental health, including self-esteem. Reduced self-esteem may put menopausal 
women at higher risk of negative outcomes of menopause and result in a more 
unpleasant and stressful menopausal experience. The objective of this study was 
to examine the role of physical activity level on self-esteem in middle-aged 
women. Methods: Women aged 45-60 from Poland took part in this study. The 
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, 
the Menopause Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory were used in this 
study. Results: Among the 111 women, the mean age was 51.7 ± 4.7. The most 
severe symptoms among studied women concerned sexual problems (1.71 ± 1.5), 
irritability (1.58 ± 1.37) and joint and muscular discomfort (1.56 ± 1.55). 
Women with higher total PA level had better self-esteem (p = 0.001). 
Conclusions: The results of this study showed that physical activity levels can 
be associated with self-esteem. Most middle-aged women reported high physical 
activity levels. These results have clinical implications for the inclusion of 
PA in the lives of middle-aged women to improve self-esteem and mental health.

Background  A large variety of endoscopic carpal tunnel release methods have 
been described in efforts to shorten recovery time, reduce scar discomfort, and 
allow earlier return to work. The majority of existing techniques are the 
modifications of the Agee, Chow, and Menon techniques, all of which require 
dedicated equipment that can increase facility and surgical fees for the patient 
and institution. We present a novel high-visibility endoscopic carpal tunnel 
release technique that uses common hand surgery instruments available in all 
surgical units, without requiring disposable or custom devices. Description of 
Technique  The cases were performed under local anesthesia using routine 
reusable instruments and a conventional 2.5-mm 30-degree small joint 
arthroscope. Following proximal dissection, a clear, colorless, plastic shield 
was created from a standard syringe that offered a 360-degree vision of the 
carpal tunnel and protection of the median nerve. Release of the transverse 
carpal ligament was performed under full arthroscopic vision using Metzenbaum 
dissection scissors. Methods  This pilot study analyses the first nine cases in 
eight patients who were operated on using this technique, with a minimum of 6 
months of follow-up. Results  No peri- or postoperative complications were 
encountered. All patients demonstrated significant improvements in the 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score, the Boston Carpal Tunnel 
Questionnaire score, and a visual analog score for pain. Conclusion  The 
high-visibility endoscopic carpal tunnel release technique is safe and 
effective, and offers a viable cost-reducing alternative to the existing 
endoscopic methods for carpal tunnel syndrome. Future comparative trials are 
required to validate these findings in a larger series. Level of Evidence  This 
is a Level IV study.

BACKGROUND: Joint, skin, oral cavity, and eye lesions are the most common 
extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis that can occur before or 
after its onset. The cases of ulcerative colitis with dermatomyositis (DM) are 
rare. In this study, we report a rare case of ulcerative colitis with DM that 
was effectively treated with infliximab.
CASE SUMMARY: The patient was a 57-year-old female with a 2-year history of DM. 
The patient was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in 
stool lasting for more than 2 mo. Colonoscopy revealed multiple erosions and 
ulcers in the entire colon and rectum. Pathological sections showed chronic 
inflammatory cell infiltration, especially neutrophil infiltration, in the 
colonic mucosa; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. 
Preparations of 5-aminosalicylic acid was added to her treatment based on the 
original treatment for DM, but its effect was unsatisfactory. The patient's 
discomfort was relieved after infliximab treatment.
CONCLUSION: Infliximab can improve DM in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. 
Specialists need to raise awareness about patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease who have rare extraintestinal manifestations.

INTRODUCTION: Among the screening tests for colorectal cancer, colonoscopy is 
currently considered the most sensitive and specific technique. However, 
computed tomography colonography (CTC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
transrectal ultrasonography have gained significant ground in the clinical 
practice of pre-treatment, screening and, more recently, post-treatment and 
surgical evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the high accuracy of CT and MRI for pre and 
postoperative colorectal cancer staging.
METHODS: Search and analysis of articles in Pubmed, Scielo, Capes Periodicals 
and American College of Radiology with headings "colorectal cancer" and 
"colonography". Weew selected 30 articles that contained radiological 
descriptions, management or statistical data related to this type of neoplasia. 
The criteria for radiological diagnosis were the American College of Radiology.
RESULTS: The great majority of patients with this subgroup of neoplasia is 
submitted to surgical procedures with the objective of cure or relief, except 
those with clinical contraindication. CTC colonography is not the most commonly 
used technique for screening; however, it is widely used for treatment planning, 
assessment of the abdomen for local complications or presence of metastasis, and 
post-surgical evaluation. MRI colonography is an alternative diagnostic method 
to CT, recommended by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. 
Although there are still no major studies on the use of MRI for screening, the 
high resolution examination has now shown good results for the American Joint 
Committee on Cancer TNM classification.
CONCLUSION: MRI and CT represent the best means for colorectal neoplasm staging. 
The use of these methods as screening tools becomes beneficial to decrease 
complications and discomfort related to colonoscopy.

INTRODUÇÃO : Dentre os testes de rastreamento de câncer colorretal, a 
colonoscopia é atualmente considerada a técnica de maior sensibilidade e 
especificidade. Entretanto, a colonografia por tomografia computadorizada (CTC), 
a ressonância nuclear magnética (RNM) e a ultrassonografia transrretal têm 
ganhado espaço significativo na prática clínica de análise pré-tratamento, 
rastreio e, mais recentemente, no pós-tratamento e na avaliação cirúrgica.
OBJETIVO: Demonstrar a alta acurácia da CT e RNM para estadiamento pré e 
pós-operatório do câncer colorretal.
MÉTODOS : Busca e análise de artigos no Pubmed, Scielo, Periódicos Capes e 
Colégio Americano de Radiologia com descritores “câncer colorretal” e 
“colonografia”. Foram selecionados 30 artigos que continham descrições 
radiológicas, manejo ou dados estatísticos relacionados a este tipo de 
neoplasia. O critério de diagnóstico radiológico adotado foi o do Colégio 
Americano de Radiologia.
RESULTADOS : A maioria dos pacientes portadores desse subgrupo de neoplasias é 
submetida a procedimentos cirúrgicos com o objetivo de cura ou alívio, exceto 
aqueles que possuem contraindicação clínica. A colonografia por tomografia 
computadorizada não é a técnica de maior utilização para rastreamento; no 
entanto, ela é amplamente utilizada para o planejamento de tratamento, avaliação 
do abdome quanto à complicações locais ou presença de metástase e avaliação 
pós-cirúrgica. A colonografia por RNM é método diagnóstico alternativo à CT 
recomendado pela American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Embora ainda não 
haja grandes estudos sobre o uso da RNM para rastreamento, atualmente o exame de 
alta resolução tem apresentado bons resultados para a classificação TNM da 
American Joint Committee on Cancer.
CONCLUSÃO : RNM e a TC representam os melhores meios para rastreamento de 
neoplasias colorretais. O uso destes métodos torna-se benéfico para diminuir as 
complicações e desconforto relacionadas à colonoscopia.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the fourth leading cause of 
healthcare-associated infections, with approximately 70%-80% being attributed to 
the inappropriate use of indwelling catheters. In many cases, indwelling 
catheters are used inappropriately without any valid indication, creating 
potentially avoidable and significant patient distress, discomfort, pain and 
activity restrictions, together with substantial care burden, cost and 
hospitalisation. In the Division of Orthopedic Surgery at Toronto Western 
Hospital (TWH), we identified UTI rate reduction as a quality improvement 
priority. Patients who underwent total hip and knee joint replacements and hip 
fracture repairs at TWH were monitored for the incidence of UTI and the usage of 
catheters. The data collected as part of the American College of Surgeons 
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) revealed UTI rate of 
2.1% among 666 patients who were treated between January and June 2016. Data 
collected through a custom field in the ACS NSQIP workstation further revealed 
that indwelling catheters were overused, with 55.2% of patients receiving 
indwelling catheters in the same time period. These data were presented to the 
orthopaedic leadership group and surgeons at TWH in July 2016 to set the quality 
improvement target and create the working group. Nursing staff was provided 
education to strictly follow the institutional catheter-associated UTI 
prevention guidelines and change ideas based on the guidelines were implemented 
in July 2016. As a result, the rate of UTI decreased to 1.1% and the use of 
indwelling catheter decreased to 19.8% among 883 patients who were treated 
between July 2016 and March 2017. The study indicated that a systematic 
approach, engaging all front-line staff including nurse educators and nurse 
practitioners, helps to facilitate implementation of practice changes. We expect 
that ongoing reminders and education ensure that the changes are sustainable.

INTRODUCTION: Shoulder pain can cause significant pain, discomfort and reduce 
the ability to perform activities of daily living, thus making it the third most 
common cause of musculoskeletal consultation. The current gold standard 
diagnostic investigation is arthroscopy. MRI is a proved sensitive and accurate 
non-invasive tool in investigating shoulder pathology, but false and misleading 
results are equally reported.
AIM: The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of MRI in diagnosing 
shoulder pathologies in comparison to arthroscopy, considering arthroscopy as 
the gold standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty nine consecutive patients, between 18-80 years of 
age, presenting with chronic shoulder pain or instability of more than 6 weeks, 
or with clinical signs of impingement or tear were included in the study. MRI of 
the shoulder joint was done followed by shoulder arthroscopy. The data collected 
was analysed for the significant correlation between MRI of shoulder and 
arthroscopic findings by kappa statistics.
RESULTS: Out of 39 patients, Rotator cuff (RC) tear was the most common 
pathology. MRI showed excellent sensitivity in the diagnosis of rotator cuff 
tears (0.91) and osteochondral defects (OCD), very good sensitivity for 
Bankart's lesion (0.8) and had poor sensitivity to detect SLAP tear (0.15). MRI 
was specific for all shoulder pathologies. MRI detected RC tears with kappa 
score of 0.73, Bankart's tear and OCD's with kappa score of 0.83 and 1.0 
respectively and SLAP lesion with kappa score of 0.14. The accuracy of MRI was 
highest in diagnosing OCD's (1.0), followed by RC tear (0.9), Bankart's tear 
(0.9) and accuracy was least in diagnosing SLAP lesion (0.7). False negative 
results were more than false positives.
CONCLUSION: The present study supports that MRI is effective in diagnosing 
rotator cuff tears, Bankart's tear and ostechondral defects but was not found to 
be helpful in diagnosing SLAP lesions. MRI and arthroscopy have complimentary 
roles in the diagnosis of shoulder pathology.

BACKGROUND: Reactive arthritis (ReA) is defined as a peripheral arthritis 
lasting longer than 1 month, associated with urethritis, cervicitis, or 
diarrhea. The reported annual incidence of ReA is approximately 30-40 cases per 
100,000 adults, occurring commonly in the age group of 16 and 35 years. It is 
known to be associated with gastrointestinal infections with Shigella, 
Salmonella, and Campylobacter species and other microorganisms, as well as with 
genitourinary infections (especially with Chlamydia trachomatis).
CASE REPORT: This article reports the case of a 53-year-old, post-right total 
hip replacement, Indian man, with ReA, who presented with fever, respiratory 
distress, and abdominal discomfort. He complained of itching, tingling 
sensation, pain on urination, and retention of urine. He had right hip joint 
pain for 3 weeks, inability to move right leg since 10 days, and melena since 1 
week. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, high liver and kidney function tests, 
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, procalcitonin and 
occult blood in stool. He tested positive for hepatitis C virus genotype 3. 
Gastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple apthoid ulcers at D2 and large gastric 
varix. Ultrasonography of whole abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and 
splenomegaly. Skin lesions and arthritis led to the diagnosis of associated ReA. 
The patient was managed conservatively and discharged in a stable condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case is unlike classical ReA because the patient is older, HLA 
B27 negative, and without florid urethritis. Admitted for fever and lower 
urinary tract symptoms, along with respiratory distress, the primary objective 
of the emergency doctors was to prevent the patient from progressing to organ 
failure. The diagnosis of underlying atypical/incomplete ReA could easily have 
been missed without adequate awareness, dermatological consultation, and a skin 
biopsy.

(1) Background: It is crucial to provide safe and knowledgeable healthcare 
practices because no research has been performed on the knowledge and usage 
patterns of NSAIDs among the Hail population. (2) Method: Structured 
questionnaires were utilized to gather data from 399 individuals in Hail, Saudi 
Arabia, for the cross-sectional analysis. The study assessed participants' 
knowledge regarding NSAIDs, patterns of use, reasons for use, and awareness of 
potential side effects. (3) Results: In the study, the gender distribution 
indicated that 170 participants (42.61%) were male, whereas 229 (57.39%) were 
female. Gender, occupation, and marital status showed non-significant 
associations except for menstrual cycle and joint pain, where marital status 
displayed significant associations (p > 0.001). Education and monthly income 
exhibited non-significant associations for all these reasons. The regression 
analysis demonstrated that gender played a significant role, with females having 
higher odds of knowledge (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.88) than males. Meanwhile, 
>50% of the participants had knowledge of adverse events related to the use of 
NSAIDs, whereas 25% had no knowledge. Moreover, 59 (25.76%) participants 
reported discomfort with the use of NSAIDs. In addition, 50% and >75% of 
respondents believed that NSAIDs could induce peptic ulcers and kidney damage, 
respectively. (4) Conclusions: This study shed light on the knowledge and 
patterns of NSAIDs use in the population of Hail, Saudi Arabia. Healthcare 
providers and policymakers should consider these insights to develop targeted 
educational initiatives and healthcare interventions to promote safe and 
informed NSAID utilization in the region.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most frequent 
unfavorable side effects. CIPN refers to the loss of peripheral nerve function 
that certain types of chemotherapy can cause.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effectiveness of cryotherapy in 
preventing CIPN and its effect on the quality of life (QoL) during chemotherapy.
METHODS: Eligible participants are cancer patients who began therapy with 
carboplatin, docetaxel, or paclitaxel in the Breast Oncology Unit between May 
2022 and October 2022. Patients were distributed into intervention groups that 
utilized cryotherapy with ice gloves and ice boots and control groups that did 
not receive cryotherapy. Patient self-report questionnaires were used to 
quantify patients' symptoms and QoL after treatment.
RESULTS: The intervention group exhibited significantly less cold sensitivity, 
hand and foot numbness, and hand tingling than the control group. Daily CIPN 
symptoms were substantially milder in the intervention group. Before and after 
treatment, nerve pain, balance, and muscle and joint discomfort were similar. 
Intervention and control groups have varied neurotoxicity adverse reaction 
scores. 2.4% of controls had grade 4 motor neurotoxicity impairment. Physical 
function and QoL improved in the intervention group.
CONCLUSIONS: Cryotherapy relieves CIPN symptoms in breast cancer patients 
receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. More thorough trials should 
be carried out to determine the best time limit and duration of cryotherapy.

India.

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are important determinant of increasing 
morbidity among all age groups, including menopausal women. The symptoms of 
menopause have a negative impact on the quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of overweight and 
obesity in menopausal women and also to find its association with menopausal 
symptoms and sociodemographic variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted among middle-aged women (40-60 
years) from April 2018 to March 2019. The Menopausal Rating Scale was used to 
assess the severity of menopausal symptoms in 400 women, and data were collected 
for sociodemographic factors, menstrual history in the past month, and personal 
history.
RESULTS: About 35.5% of menopausal women were overweight/obese (26% overweight 
and 9.5% obese) with average body mass index of 23.9 ± 4.84 and mean age of 
53.65 ± 5.11 years Joint and muscular discomfort (P = 0.001), hypertension (P = 
0.014), literacy level (P = 0.009), and socioeconomic status (P = 0.01) were 
significantly associated with overweight/obesity. With reference to women with 
no/little somatic and urogenital complaints, the odds of developing obesity was 
more (adjusted odds) in patients with mild (odds ratio [OR] - 2.8), moderate (OR 
- 2.1), and severe (2.19) somatic complaints and also higher risk in patients 
with mild (OR-3.2), moderate (OR - 1.1), and severe (OR - 1.74) urogenital 
symptoms. The age of menopause was significantly more among overweight than 
normal-weight women (P = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity associated with menopause require increased 
attention and a multidisciplinary approach to women's health to prevent 
morbidity in this population group.

INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are diseases of the 
temporomandibular joint and masticatory muscles, and are often difficult to be 
diagnosed because they have various symptoms, pathological conditions and 
causes.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: Herein, we report a 78-year-old male referred to our 
hospital with a diagnosis of TMD and presenting with facial asymmetry, marked 
deviation to the right side on vertical mandibular movement and complaints of 
abnormal perception at the right oral and buccal region. Past medical history 
revealed that he had undergone a right intracranial trigeminal schwannoma 
resection 9 years prior. Computed tomography (CT) showed disuse atrophy of the 
right side of 4 masticatory muscles and 2 suprahyoid muscles controlled by the 
motor component of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve (TGN). 
Together with the neurosurgeon, we confirmed that there was no recurrence of the 
tumor and explained to the patient that the oral and maxillofacial symptoms are 
after-effects of the operation, and we provided oral hygiene instructions and 
coordinated cleaning of the inside of the oral cavity.
DISCUSSION: Although it is difficult to compare treatment methods from case to 
case, we believe that in our case, the patient's understanding of the cause of 
his discomfort contributed significantly to the improvement of his quality of 
life.
CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of masticatory muscle disuse atrophy during 
long-term follow-up after resection of intracranial trigeminal schwannoma. 
Further studies are needed to develop the diagnostic and therapeutic protocols 
for disuse atrophy.

PURPOSE: In this study, we present the treatment of the psoriatic nail beds of 
patients refractory to standard therapies using high-dose-rate (HDR) 
brachytherapy. The custom-made micro applicators (CMMA) were designed and 
constructed for radiation dose delivery to small curvy targets with complicated 
topology. The role of the HDR brachytherapy treatment was to stimulate the T 
cells for an increased immune response.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patient diagnosed with psoriatic nail beds refractory 
to standard therapies received monthly subunguinal injections that caused 
significant pain and discomfort in both hands. The clinical target was defined 
as the length from the fingertip to the distal interphalangeal joint. For the 
accurate and reproducible setup in the multi-fractional treatment delivery, the 
CMMAs were designed. Five needles were embedded into the dense plastic mesh and 
covered with 5 mm bolus material for each micro applicator. Five CMMAs were 
designed, resulting in the usage of 25 catheters in total.
RESULTS: The prescription dose was planned to the depth of the anterior surface 
of the distal phalanx, allowing for the sparing of the surrounding tissue. The 
total number of the active dwell positions was 145 with step size of 5 mm. The 
total treatment time was 115 seconds with a 7.36 Ci activity of the 192Ir 
source. The treatment resulted in good pain control. The patient did not require 
further injections to the nail bed. After this initial treatment, additional two 
patients with similar symptoms received HDR brachytherapy. The treatment outcome 
was favorable in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The first HDR brachytherapy treatment of psoriasis of the nail bed 
is presented. The initial experience revealed that brachytherapy treatment was 
well-tolerated and resulted in adequate control of the disease. A larger cohort 
of patients will be required for additional conclusions related to the long-term 
clinical benefits.

Periprosthetic knee infection is a complication associated with prosthetic 
failure; incidence change from 0,4-2% of primary total knee replacement and 5,6% 
in revisions; incidence is increasing over the years. Two-stage revision is the 
technique used in chronic infection. Aim of the work is to check success rate in 
our data. Methods. We analyzed retrospectively data of patients who undergone 
two stage revision surgery between 01/01/2010 to 31/12/2015. We made a clinical 
and radiological control after 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months and we evaluate the 
outcome in December 2016. Results. Between 2010 and 2015 we treated 45 patients 
with two-stage revision. Mean follow-up was 3,4 years. Success rate is 89,9%. We 
had failure in 5 patients: everyone had knee surgery before first knee 
arthroplasty and Charlson Comorbidity Score was greater then 4 in 4 
cases. Conclusions. Two stage revision can be considered a successful treatment 
in chronic periprosthetic knee infection. It has an optimal success rate, but it 
has some disadvantages as joint stiffness and pain in the interval between 
stages. This is a technique with two major surgery procedure with associated 
morbidity, discomfort, cost and prolonged stay in hospital.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of menopausal 
symptoms, its effect to the quality of life and their treatment seeking 
behaviour in a multiracial community in Malaysia.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving postmenopausal women in Klang 
Valley, Malaysia. Data was obtained by face-to-face interview using standardised 
questionnaires on sociodemographic data, Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire, 
effect to quality of life and treatment sought.
RESULTS: A total of 258 women, including Malays (82%), Indians (14.1%) and 
Chinese (3.9%) were recruited. The median age was 58 (range 45-86) years old. 
Joint and muscular discomfort (73.3%) and fatigue (59.3%) were the most 
prevalent symptoms. Significant association with ethnicity were demonstrated 
with Malays was found to have 3.1 times higher incidence of sexual problems than 
Indians, (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.103; 95%CI 1.209, 7.967) and Indian had 2.6 times 
higher incidence of irritability compared to Malays (OR 2.598; 95%CI 1.126, 
5.992). Fifty-two percent of women felt that menopausal symptoms affected their 
quality of life but there were only 2.7% who were severely affected. There were 
24.8% of women who sought treatment and only 20.3% of those who took hormone 
replacement therapy. There was no significant association found between their 
treatment seeking behaviour in association with ethnicity, age, parity, marital 
and occupational status.
CONCLUSION: Menopausal symptoms were prevalent among menopausal women, although 
only a small group of women who were severely affected. There was a lack of 
tendency in seeking treatment for menopausal symptoms among the women.

Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio.

CONTEXT: Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are commonly 
found in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis 
and meniscus tears. Histologically, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue with 
fibrosis evident, and there may be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. 
Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may also be found within the cyst, even if they 
are not seen in the knee joint. Baker's cysts can be a source of posterior knee 
pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and 
they are routinely discovered on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the 
symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and 
may be related to size.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search was conducted with keywords related to the 
history, diagnosis, and treatment of Baker's cysts-namely, Baker's cyst, 
popliteal cyst, diagnosis, treatment, formation of popliteal cyst, surgical 
indications, and complications. Bibliographies from these references were also 
reviewed to identify related and pertinent literature.
STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.
RESULTS: Baker's cysts are commonly found associated with intra-articular knee 
disorders. Proper diagnosis, examination, and treatment are paramount in 
alleviating the pain and discomfort associated with Baker's cysts.
CONCLUSION: A capsular opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius 
bursa is a commonly found normal anatomic variant. It is thought that this can 
lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst in the presence of chronic knee 
effusions as a result of intra-articular pathology. Management of symptomatic 
popliteal cysts is conservative. The intra-articular pathology should be first 
addressed by arthroscopy. If surgical excision later becomes necessary, a 
limited posteromedial approach is often employed. Other treatments, such as 
arthroscopic debridement and closure of the valvular mechanism, are not well 
studied and cannot yet be recommended.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive technique to 
completely peel the pathological mucosa from the submucosa under endoscopy, 
which has been often utilized to treat early gastric cancer. During the 
operation, anesthesia is required to reduce the discomfort due to the 
complexity, high risk, and longtime operation of ESD. In this study, we compared 
different anesthesia methods on anesthetic effect and postoperative pain in 
patients (≥65 years old) with early gastric cancer during ESD. For this purpose, 
60 patients with early gastric cancer who were more than 65 years old were 
selected from January 2019 to December 2021, where 30 patients treated with 
simple intravenous general anesthesia were divided into the simple group and 30 
patients treated with intravenous combined inhalation general anesthesia were 
regarded as the composite group. The hemodynamic index, wake-up time, 
postoperative pain intensity, operation time, and the incidence of adverse 
reactions were compared between the two groups. For the hemodynamic index before 
incision, after incision, and at the end of the operation, the mean arterial 
pressure (MAP) in the composite group was higher than that in the simple group 
(P < 0.05) and the heart rate (HR) was lower than that in the simple group (P < 
0.05). After the ESD operation, the wake-up time and visual analogue scale (VAS) 
in the composite group were lower than those in the simple group (P < 0.05). In 
addition, the ESD operation time and incidence of adverse reactions in the 
composite group was significantly lower than that in the simple group (P < 
0.05). These results showed that intravenous combined inhalation general 
anesthesia had a good anesthetic effect, stable hemodynamics during ESD 
operation, and slight postoperative pain.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic, and 
fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) of unknown etiology that primarily affects 
the elderly. Patients with IPF suffer from a heavy symptom burden and usually 
have a poor quality of life. Dyspnea and dry cough are predominant symptoms of 
IPF. Although pain is not considered one of the main symptoms of IPF, it can 
occur for a variety of reasons, such as hypoxia, coughing, muscle and nerve 
damage, deconditioning, and steroid use. The prevalence of pain in IPF patients 
varies greatly, ranging from around 30 to 80%, with the prevalence being 
estimated mostly among patients in the end-of-life period. It manifests itself 
in the form of muscle pain, joint discomfort, or back and chest pain. Approaches 
to the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in patients with IPF include 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures that are also important to 
optimize the treatment of other symptoms (dyspnea and cough) and the optimal 
treatment of comorbidities. Given the scarcity of data on this symptom in the 
literature, this article summarizes what is currently known about the etiology 
and treatment of musculoskeletal pain in IPF.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative condition characterized by pain and 
loss of function. A pathological biochemical environment with excess 
inflammatory and catabolic proteins is a major contributor to OA. nSTRIDE(®) 
Autologous Protein Solution (APS) is a new therapy under development for the 
treatment of OA. This therapy is formed from a patient's blood and contains high 
concentrations of anti-inflammatory and anabolic proteins. This study assessed 
the safety and treatment effects of APS. Eleven subjects with early to moderate 
OA were injected with APS. Subjects were closely monitored for adverse events 
(AE) following the injection. Treatment outcome measures were obtained before 
injection. AE and clinical outcomes were assessed at 1 and 2 weeks postinjection 
and 1, 3, and 6 months postinjection. There were no serious AE or AE that were 
reported by the investigator as greater than mild in severity. There were no AE 
that were related to the device. There were minor AE related to the injection 
procedure, including injection site discomfort (1/11), injection site joint pain 
(1/11), and procedural nausea (1/11), which resolved quickly and did not require 
treatment. Mean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index 
(WOMAC) composite scores and pain, stiffness, and function subscale scores all 
showed significant improvement compared to baseline by 2 weeks postinjection. 
The data presented here suggest that the treatment is safe and show a 
complication profile that is mild and consistent with similar treatments. A 
single injection of APS for treatment of early to moderate knee OA led to 
symptom improvement over the study course. Based on these results, an adequately 
powered, well-controlled, randomized multicenter study to establish clinical 
efficacy is warranted.

PURPOSE: To compare mid-term outcomes of hemi-resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) and 
total resurfacing arthroplasty (TRA).
METHODS: Seven men and 5 women (16 hips) aged 33 to 72 (mean, 50) years 
underwent HRA, whereas 7 men and 3 women (16 hips) aged 23 to 52 (mean, 40) 
years underwent metal-on-metal TRA; all were for osteonecrosis of the femoral 
head. In the HRA and TRA groups respectively, 10 and 8 hips were 
steroid-induced, whereas 6 and 8 hips were related to alcohol abuse. Surgery for 
12 and 4 hips entailed the posterolateral approach, whereas 4 and 12 hips 
entailed the Hardinge approach. Usually, HRA was performed for early stages of 
the disease, and TRA for more advanced stages. 12 and 6 hips were classified as 
JOA stages 1 to 3A, whereas 4 and 10 hips as stages 3B to 4. All the hips were 
JOA types C1 or C2.
RESULTS: In the HRA and TRA groups respectively, the mean follow-up period were 
6.5 and 5.5 years. The mean total JOA hip scores were 57 and 54 preoperatively, 
93 and 97 at one year, and 84 and 96 at the final follow-up (p<0.01). The higher 
score in the TRA patients was mainly attributed to improvement in the pain 
score. In the HRA group, 12 hips developed groin pain or groin discomfort while 
walking, though only 4 of them showed apparent joint-space narrowing. Five 
patients underwent revision surgeries (conversion to total hip arthroplasty) 
owing to a femoral neck fracture, acetabular protrusio, osteoarthritic change, 
and severe groin pain. Patients having TRA had no revision surgery and did not 
complain of groin pain. Implants in both groups were radiographically stable.
CONCLUSION: TRA were superior to HRA in terms of pain relief and implant 
survival, even though the former procedure was used for more advanced cases.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the results of a new technique developed for aneurysmal 
bone cysts centrally located in the proximal humeral metaphysis leading to 
widespread destruction.
METHODS: The study included seven patients (5 boys, 2 girls; mean age 12.8 
years; range 9 to 15 years) who were treated with cortical collapsing and 
massive fibular autograft for centrally located aneurysmal bone cysts in the 
proximal humeral metaphysis leading to widespread destruction. All the patients 
had type II and active tumors according to the criteria of Capanna et al. and 
Campanacci et al., respectively. Final evaluations included six patients because 
one patient was lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 49 months 
(range 12 to 105 months).
RESULTS: No complications were seen in the early postoperative period. 
Radiographic examination showed partial recurrence in two patients; of whom, one 
patient underwent curettage and bone grafting in the postoperative second year 
because of pain and discomfort. No deformity was observed. One patient developed 
shortening of 0.5 cm. Radiographically, all the patients exhibited metaphyseal 
remodelling one year after surgery. Function of the shoulder joint was 
near-normal in all the patients.
CONCLUSION: In this technique, cortical collapsing reduces the amount of bone 
graft used, and massive fibular strut grafting provides structural support to 
prevent deformities.

BACKGROUND: Radial head fracture is the most common fracture of the elbow. It 
usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. In 1954, Mason classified 
these fractures into type 1 (undisplaced), type 2 (simple displaced), and type 3 
(comminuted fractures). Aspiration of the elbow joint aims to relieve pressure 
in the elbow joint and has been used as an initial treatment option for radial 
head fractures. However, it is an invasive technique with the potential for 
complications such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of elbow joint aspiration 
for treating radial head fracture in adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register (14 April 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (14 April 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to April Week 1 2014) 
and EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 15), trial registries, bibliographies and 
conference proceedings.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials 
comparing aspiration versus no aspiration for treating radial head fractures in 
adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected 
articles, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved 
by discussion. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable studies using 
fixed-effect meta-analysis.
MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials that involved 126 participants but provided 
results for only 108 participants. Most participants were adults, typically over 
30 years of age. Both trials were at high risk of selection, performance, 
detection and reporting bias. Reflecting this high risk of bias, we downgraded 
the quality of evidence two levels for study limitations and a further level for 
imprecision. Thus we judged the evidence for all outcomes to be 'very low' 
quality, meaning that we are very uncertain about these estimates.One trial 
included participants with Mason type 1, 2 or 3 radial head fractures and also a 
few cases of traumatic elbow hemarthrosis without fracture. The other trial 
included participants with Mason type 1 and 2 fractures. All participants were 
managed non-surgically.Neither trial reported functional outcome based on 
validated patient-reported outcome measures of function or pain using validated 
measures such as a visual analogue scale. Very low quality evidence (108 
participants, two trials) indicates little difference between aspiration and no 
aspiration in impaired function (unable to carry heavy loads; discomfort when 
carrying loads) at 12 months (9/51 in aspiration group versus 7/57 in the no 
aspiration group; risk ratio 1.43 favouring no aspiration, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.57 to 3.58). Very low quality evidence (two trials) suggests a 
beneficial effect of aspiration on pain relief immediately after aspiration. 
Very low quality evidence (one trial, 28 participants) shows less pain after 
aspiration at three weeks, but it is unclear whether this applies subsequently. 
Neither trial reported on adverse events (for example, nerve and vascular 
injuries; deep or superficial infection) from the procedure, but aspiration was 
reported as being unsuccessful in three participants (7.9%) in one trial. Very 
low quality evidence indicates little difference in range of motion (based on 
elbow extension) between the two groups at six weeks (28 participants, one 
trial) or 12 months (108 participants, two trials). The report of adverse events 
was incomplete, but one trial (80 participants) reported the absence of three 
specific complications: myositis ossificans, joint instability or late 
displacement of the fracture.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine the 
effectiveness of joint aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head 
fracture in terms of function, pain and range of motion or to determine the 
safety of the procedure. An examination of current aspiration use, the 
prospective collection of adverse events and consultation with patients as to 
their preferences and values would be helpful in guiding decisions about the 
future design of a multicentre randomised trial aiming to obtain definitive 
evidence on the use of aspiration for treating radial head fractures.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) have revolutionized treatment of 
advanced melanoma, leading to an emerging population of long-term survivors. 
Survivors' quality of life (QOL) and symptom burden are poorly understood. We 
set out to evaluate symptom burden and QOL in patients with advanced melanoma 
alive more than 1 year after initiating CI therapy.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys, accompanied by chart review of patients with 
advanced melanoma treated with CIs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 
completed therapy, and were alive >1 year after treatment initiation. Surveys 
were administered between February and August 2018. Surveys included: European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-Core 30, EuroQOL, items from Patient-Reported Outcomes version of 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Fatigue Severity Scale.
RESULTS: We included 90 patients. The most common CI regimens were ipilimumab 
plus nivolumab (53%) and pembrolizumab (41%); most patients (71%) were not 
treated in clinical trials. Median time from CI therapy initiation was 40 months 
and from last dose was 28 months. Fatigue was reported by 28%, with higher 
fatigue scores in women than men; 12% reported difficulty sleeping. Aching 
joints (17%) and muscles (12%) were fairly common. Level of functioning was 
generally high. Overall QOL was excellent though 40% reported 'some or moderate' 
problems with anxiety/depression and 31% with pain/discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: After CI therapy, long-surviving advanced melanoma patients 
commonly report fatigue but otherwise have moderate symptom burden and good QOL. 
Ensuring appropriate symptom management will optimize clinical outcomes for 
these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the outcomes of surgical treatment of sacral neurogenic 
tumors
METHODS: Between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2012, data on 64 patients with 
sacral neurogenic tumors treated with surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The 
mean age of the 64 cases (35 males and 29 females) was 37.2 years (range, 
21-69 years); 38 had neurilemmomas and 26 neurofibromas. Thirty-four of the 
tumors involved S 1 and S 2 , 11 S 3 or lower, and 19 were single presacral soft 
tissue masses. Tumors were removed via anterior, posterior or combined 
anteroposterior approaches. Patients with unstable sacroiliac joints underwent 
iliolumbar fixation.
RESULTS: Depending on the extent of tumor involvement, one of three surgical 
approaches was used: a single anterior approach (19 patients), single posterior 
approach (25 patients), or a combined anteroposterior approach (20 patients). 
The mean operation time was 3 h (range, 2-6 h) and the mean blood loss 878 mL 
(range, 400-3120 mL). The mean duration of follow-up was 58.2 months (range, 
24-93 months). These surgeries had the following complications. Three patients 
had massive intraoperative hemorrhage and posterior back pain and discomfort 
postoperatively. One patient had intraoperative ureteral injuries requiring 
intraoperative ureteral catheterization. In two patients, the tumor involved the 
S 1 nerve roots bilaterally, necessitating their removal, which resulted in 
obvious lower limb motion and sphincteric dysfunction. In 13 patients with 
unilateral tumor involvement of the nerve roots of S 1 and lower spinal levels, 
only the contralateral nerve roots of the S1 and lower levels were preserved; 
eight of these patients had impaired bladder and bowel function. Posterior 
incisions failed to heal in 10 patients, secondary wound healing occurred in 
nine of them and one required a gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap. Three 
patients developed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks that were and 
alleviated by waist belt compression bandaging and placing them in the 
Trendelenburg position. Eight patients developed tumor recurrences 
postoperatively; pathological examination of the tissue excised in the second 
surgeries revealed malignant changes in the three patients with neurilemmomas. 
There were no intraoperative deaths. Rod fractures occurred in three of the 18 
patients requiring iliolumbar reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of sacral neurogenic tumors make them 
easy to diagnose. The approach to resection should be determined by the location 
and size of the tumor. Patients with huge tumors may lose considerable blood 
intraoperatively and a have higher risk rate of postoperative complications.

INTRODUCTION: Non-emergency patient transportation (NEPT) services are 
particularly important nowadays due to the aging population and contagious 
disease outbreaks (e.g., Covid-19 and SARS). In this work, we study a NEPT 
problem with a case study of patient transportation services in Hong Kong. The 
purpose of this work is to study the discomfort and inconvenience measures 
(e.g., waiting time and extra ride time) associated with the transportation of 
non-emergency patients while optimizing the operational costs and utilization of 
NEPT ambulances.
METHODS: A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is developed to 
model the NEPT problem. This MILP model contributes to the existing literature 
by not only including the patient inconvenience measures in the objective 
function but also illustrating a better trade-off among different performance 
measures through its specially customized formulation and real-life 
characteristics. CPLEX is used to find the optimal solutions for the test 
instances. To overcome the computational complexity of the problem, a 
clustering-based iterative heuristic framework is designed to solve problems of 
practical sizes. The proposed framework distinctively exploits the 
problem-specific structure of the considered NEPT problem in a novel way to 
enhance and improve the clustering mechanism by repeatedly updating cluster 
centers.
RESULTS: The computational experiments on 19 realistic problem instances show 
the effective execution of the solution method and demonstrate the applicability 
of our approach. Our heuristic framework observes an optimality gap of less than 
5% for all those instances where CPLEX delivered the result. The weighted 
objective function of the proposed model supports the analysis of different 
performance measures by setting different preferences for these measures. An 
extensive sensitivity analysis performed to observe the behavior of the MILP 
model shows that when operating costs are given a weightage of 0.05 in the 
objective function, the penalty value for user inconvenience measures is the 
lowest; when the weightage value for operating costs varies between 0.8 and 1.0, 
the penalty value for the same measures is the highest.
CONCLUSIONS: This research can assist decision-makers in improving service 
quality by balancing operational costs and patient discomfort during 
transportation.

BACKGROUND: Yunnan Baiyao capsule (YBC), a marketed herbal medicine in mainland 
China, is widely used to control bleeding. This study's aim was to determine the 
occurrence of YBC-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among users of the 
medicine.
METHODS: This hospital-intensive monitoring study was conducted in 163 hospitals 
across China. Consumers who used YBC (Z53020799) between June 2015 and December 
2016 were included. By face-to-face interview or telephone, the circumstances 
and experiences of their adverse events (AEs), during drug taking and 14 days 
after drug withdrawal, were recorded at follow-up and later encoded by 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 1997. The Naranjo Adverse 
Reaction Probability Scale (APS) was used to determine the likelihood of ADRs.
RESULTS: A total of 31,556 participants were included (follow-up rate 99.40%). 
AEs occurred in 742 participants, of which 561 were reported as "not related 
with drug use" by their physician-in-charge. Based on the remaining 181 cases, 
the overall ADR incidence was 1.17% (intention to treat) and 0.58% (per 
protocol), with abnormal findings mainly concentrated in the digestive system, 
skin and respiratory system. The top 5 frequently reported reactions were nausea 
and vomiting (0.1785%, 56 cases of 31,367 participants), functional diarrhea 
(0.1180%, 37 of 31,367 participants), stomach discomfort (0.0893%, 28 of 31,367 
participants), rash (0.0574%, 18 of 31,367 participants) and gastro-esophageal 
reflux (0.0383%, 12 of 31,367 participants). Among them, functional diarrhea and 
stomach discomfort were judged as definite ADRs of YBC.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large study, treatment of YBC was found to be associated 
with ADRs with an incidence of 1.17%, although most were relatively mild and not 
considered to be life-threatening.

In osteoarthritis (OA), the articular cartilage covering the articular surface 
of the bone wears out, exposing the subchondral bone, and the synovial membrane 
surrounding the joint becomes inflamed, causing pain and deformity. OA causes 
pain, stiffness, and swelling, and discomfort in the knee when climbing stairs 
is a typical symptom. Although drug development studies are conducted to treat 
these inflammatory joint diseases, it is difficult to find conclusive research 
results which could reduce inflammation and slow cartilage tear. The development 
of drugs to relieve inflammatory pain often utilizes inflammatory triggers. 
Interleukins, one of the proteins in the limelight as pro-inflammatory factors, 
are immune-system-stimulating factors that promote the body's fight against 
harmful factors such as bacteria. In this study, inflammation was induced in 
Chondrocytes cells (Chon-001 cells) with IL-1β and then treated with integrin 
αvβ3 to show anti-inflammatory and chondrogenesis effects. Integrin αvβ3 was not 
toxic to Chon-001 cells in any concentration groups treated with or without 
IL-1β. COX-2 and iNOS, which are major markers of inflammation, were 
significantly reduced by integrin αvβ3 treatment. Expressions of p-ERK, p-JNK, 
and p-p38 corresponding to the MAPKs signaling pathway and p-IκBα and p-p65 
corresponding to the NF-κB signaling pathway were also decreased in a 
dose-dependent manner upon integrin αvβ3 treatment, indicating that inflammation 
was inhibited, whereas treatment with integrin αvβ3 significantly increased the 
expression of ALP, RUNX2, BMP2, BMP4, Aggrecan, SOX9, and COL2A1, suggesting 
that osteogenesis and chondrogenesis were induced. These results suggest that 
integrin αvβ3 in-duces an anti-inflammatory effect, osteogenesis, and 
chondrogenesis on IL-1β-induced Chon-001 cells.

We describe the case of a patient who swallowed a small fish bone and felt it 
lodge in her pharynx, but failed to seek medical attention in a timely manner. 
One week later, no foreign body was found in the hypopharynx or larynx, but a 
small purulent cyst was present in the epiglottic vallecula. A computed 
tomography scan showed a high-density area on the lingual surface of the 
epiglottis, which was considered to represent an embedded fish bone. A week 
later, the patient's discomfort had subsided, and flexible videoendoscopy showed 
that the purulent cyst in the epiglottic vallecula had disappeared. We surmise 
that the purulent cyst had ruptured spontaneously and the foreign body had been 
discharged. This represents an example of how an impacted small foreign body may 
be spontaneously discharged from the body.

PURPOSE: Patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) often undergo 
nerve conduction studies (NCSs). Although patients sometimes complain of 
NCS-related discomfort, including severe pain, pain evaluations during such NCSs 
are lacking. We aimed to measure the pain experienced by patients with CTS 
during NCSs.
METHODS: This prospective study included 30 patients with CTS who underwent NCSs 
between April 2018 and March 2019. Pain because of electrical stimulation during 
NCSs was evaluated using a visual analog scale, and we statistically analyzed 
pain-related factors such as age, sex, complications, severity grading scale, 
the intensity of maximum stimulation, and examination time.
RESULTS: The mean visual analog scale score for NCSs was 5.2, and the visual 
analog scale score increased as the intensity of maximum stimulation and 
examination time increased.
CONCLUSIONS: We measured the pain because of electrical stimulation experienced 
by patients with CTS during NCSs. Our findings indicate that medical staff must 
be mindful of the potential pain experienced by patients during NCSs and educate 
patients regarding the necessity of the examination and its procedures.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy-related posterior pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) is one of the 
most important clinical manifestations of postpartum back pain. Those affected 
often complain of discomfort during daily activities. It is hypothesized that 
altered motor control is associated with perceived pain. Pelvic support can 
regulate possible underlying altered motor control mechanisms and decrease pain. 
However, the influence of a lumbosacral orthosis, which is broader support that 
allows for a wider contact area and more skin sensory stimulation to restore 
proper motor function, has not yet been investigated in women with postpartum 
PPGP.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the efficacy of broader lumbar support and 
narrower pelvic support on pain, proprioception, disability, and muscle strength 
in women with pregnancy-related PPGP.
METHODS: This study will be a single-center, 3-armed, participant-blinded, 
randomized controlled trial. In total, 84 women diagnosed with pregnancy-related 
PPGP will be recruited and randomly assigned into 3 groups. Intervention groups 
A and B will receive pelvic and lumbar supports, respectively. Group C (control) 
will receive only a patient education leaflet containing advice on strengthening 
exercises, comfortable positions, and other practical information. The study 
outcomes are pain, effort score during the active straight leg raising test, 
maximum isometric hip flexion force, maximum isometric hip external rotation 
force, maximum isometric trunk rotation force, and joint position reproduction 
of hip abduction. The study outcomes will be measured at 4 time points: baseline 
(T1), immediately after the intervention (T2), 4 weeks following interventions 
began (at this time, the intervention period is completed) (T3), and 1 week 
after discontinuing the interventions (T4) to evaluate the possible lasting 
effects of wearing supports. Multivariate analysis of variance will be used to 
test between- and within-group differences.
RESULTS: Recruitment for this study will be started in summer 2022 and is 
expected to be completed by the end of fall 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will examine the efficacy of broader lumbar support as 
an early rehabilitative treatment for women receiving postpartum posterior 
pelvic pain support compared to those receiving a narrower pelvic support. We 
expect the broader lumbar support to impact pain management and disability 
better than the current narrower pelvic belt. Long-term follow-up studies will 
help determine whether such lumbosacral orthosis reduces pain and improves daily 
activities in women with pregnancy-related PPGP.

BACKGROUND: Chordoma is a rare low-grade malignant tumor originating from 
embryonic notochordal tissue mainly occurring in the axial bone, mostly in the 
spheno-occipital junction and sacrococcyx, which accounts for approximately 1% 
of all malignant bone tumors and 0.1%-0.2% of intracranial tumors. Chordoma in 
the petrous mastoid region is rare.
CASE SUMMARY: We describe a 36-year-old male patient with chordoma in the left 
petrous mastoid region. The main clinical manifestations were pain and 
discomfort, which lasted for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 
lobulated mass in the left petrous mastoid with an unclear boundary and obvious 
enhancement. The tumor was completely removed after surgical treatment, and a 
histological examination confirmed that the tumor was a chordoma. During 5 years 
of follow-up, no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence or metastasis 
was found.
CONCLUSION: Chordoma in the petrosal mastoid region is rare but should be 
included in differential diagnosis of petrosal mastoid tumors.

As the U.S. population ages, efficacious interventions are needed to manage pain 
and maintain physical function among older adults with osteoarthritis (OA). 
Skeletal muscle weakness is a primary contributory factor to pain and functional 
decline among persons with OA, thus interventions are needed that improve muscle 
strength. High-load resistance exercise is the best-known method of improving 
muscle strength; however high-compressive loads commonly induce significant 
joint pain among persons with OA. Thus interventions with low-compressive loads 
are needed which improve muscle strength while limiting joint stress. This study 
is investigating the potential of an innovative training paradigm, known as 
Kaatsu, for this purpose. Kaatsu involves performing low-load exercise while 
externally-applied compression partially restricts blood flow to the active 
skeletal muscle. The objective of this randomized, single-masked pilot trial is 
to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of chronic Kaatsu training for 
improving skeletal muscle strength and physical function among older adults. 
Participants aged ≥ 60 years with physical limitations and symptomatic knee OA 
will be randomly assigned to engage in a 3-month intervention of either (1) 
center-based, moderate-load resistance training, or (2) Kaatsu training matched 
for overall workload. Study dependent outcomes include the change in 1) knee 
extensor strength, 2) objective measures of physical function, and 3) subjective 
measures of physical function and pain. This study will provide novel 
information regarding the therapeutic potential of Kaatsu training while also 
informing about the long-term clinical viability of the paradigm by evaluating 
participant safety, discomfort, and willingness to continually engage in the 
intervention.

Chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP) is defined as pain or discomfort 
originating from the waist, which lasts for at least 12 weeks, but no 
radiculopathy or specific spinal diseases. CNLBP is a complicated medical 
problem and places a huge burden on healthcare systems. Clinical manifestation 
of CNLBP includes discogenic LBP, zygapophyseal joint pain, sacroiliac joint 
pain, and lumbar muscle strain. Further evaluation should be completed to 
confirm the diagnosis including auxiliary examination, functional assessment, 
and clinical assessment. The principle of the management is to relieve pain, 
restore function, and avoid recurrence. Treatment includes conservative 
treatment, minimally invasive treatment, and rehabilitation. Pharmacologic 
therapy is the first-line treatment of nonspecific LBP, and it is most widely 
used in clinical practice. Interventional therapy should be considered only 
after failure of medication and physical therapy. Multidisciplinary 
rehabilitation can improve physical function and alleviate short-term and 
long-term pain. The emphasis should be put on the prevention of NLBP and 
reducing relevant risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of dorsal plating 
versus volar plating with limited dorsal open reduction in the management of AO 
type C3 distal radius fractures with impacted articular fragments.
METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent dorsal plating (Group A) (14 females, 16 
males; mean age = 56.8 ± 10.1 years) and 28 who underwent volar plating with 
limited dorsal open reduction (Group B) (12 females, 16 males; mean age = 55.6 ± 
17.7 years) for type C3 distal radius fractures with impacted articular 
fragments between 2006 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The mean 
follow-up was 14.5 ± 3.2 months in group A and 13.2 ± 2.4 months in group B. The 
articular step-off, articular gap and joint penetration by screws on the 
computed tomography scans were used for radiologic evaluation. The functional 
outcomes were evaluated with range of motion, grip power, Quick Disabilities of 
the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, and Mayo wrist score.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the step-off distance at 1 year 
after surgery between the two groups (P < 0.05). The ranges of extension, 
rotation, and radial and ulnar deviations did not differ between the groups. 
However, group B had a significantly higher range of flexion in the wrist joint 
than Group A (P = 0.010). The grip power, DASH score, and Mayo wrist score did 
not also differ between the groups. Implant removal owing to any discomfort at 
the operative site was performed in 15 patients (63%) in Group A and 7 patients 
(28%) in Group B.
CONCLUSION: Similar clinical results can be obtained by both dorsal plating and 
volar plating with limited dorsal open reduction in treating type C3 distal 
radius fractures with impacted articular fragments. However, volar plating with 
limited dorsal open reduction can provide better wrist flexion with a low 
incidence of complications associated with implantation.

BACKGROUND: Certain postoperative wounds are recognised to be associated with 
more complications than others and may be termed high-risk. Wound healing can be 
particularly challenging following high-energy trauma where wound necrosis and 
infection rates are high. Surgical incision for joint arthrodesis can also be 
considered high-risk as it requires extensive and invasive surgery and 
postoperative distal limb swelling and wound dehiscence are common. Recent human 
literature has investigated the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) 
over high-risk closed surgical incisions and beneficial effects have been noted 
including decreased drainage, decreased dehiscence and decreased infection 
rates. In a randomised, controlled study twenty cases undergoing distal limb 
high-energy fracture stabilisation or arthrodesis were randomised to NPWT or 
control groups. All cases had a modified Robert-Jones dressing applied for 72 h 
postoperatively and NPWT was applied for 24 h in the NPWT group. Morphometric 
assessment of limb circumference was performed at six sites preoperatively, 24 
and 72 h postoperatively. Wound discharge was assessed at 24 and 72 h. 
Postoperative analgesia protocol was standardised and a Glasgow Composite 
Measure Pain Score (GCPS) carried out at 24, 48 and 72 h. Complications were 
noted and differences between groups were assessed.
RESULTS: Percentage change in limb circumference between preoperative and 24 and 
72 h postoperative measurements was significantly less at all sites for the NPWT 
group with exception of the joint proximal to the surgical site and the centre 
of the operated bone at 72 h. Median discharge score was lower in the NPWT group 
than the control group at 24 h. No significant differences in GCPS or 
complication rates were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital swelling and wound discharge were reduced when NPWT was 
employed for closed incision management. Larger studies are required to evaluate 
whether this will result in reduced discomfort and complication rates 
postoperatively.

Introduction Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common 
congenital disability in newborns. The condition can range from a slight laxity 
in the hip joint to secondary femoral head injury, early osteoarthritis (OA), 
and mobility issues. There are several risk factors for DDH, including positive 
family history, female sex, breech presentation, and the presence of clubfoot. 
Early detection and treatment are crucial to avoid long-term hip dysplasia and 
arthritis, which can cause difficulty in walking and discomfort. Breech 
presentation, in particular, is a significant risk factor for DDH, with 
spontaneous vaginal birth increasing the risk of hip pathology and instability 
compared to elective Caesarean section. However, whether breech presentation 
continues to be a risk factor for DDH in preterm children is unknown. Objective 
and methods This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of breech 
presentation and other gestational/delivery characteristics among newborns 
diagnosed with DDH. This retrospective study was conducted at Abha Maternity and 
Children Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, over a period of six months. Data were 
collected from medical records of DDH cases diagnosed between 2016 and 2023. 
Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, 
Redmond, Washington, United States) and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 
22 (Released 2013; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Descriptive 
statistics and statistical tests were used to analyze the data. Results Most of 
the diagnosed children were female (86.7%), and bilateral hip dislocation (40%) 
was the most common presentation. X-ray was the most common diagnostic tool 
(48.3%), and operative management was the most common management strategy 
(73.3%). A positive family history of DDH was reported in more than one-third of 
cases. The study also analyzed the association between complications during 
pregnancy and various factors such as mode of delivery, presentation at 
delivery, gestational age at delivery, and associated maternal diseases. The 
difference in complication rates between women who delivered via C-section and 
those who delivered vaginally was insignificant (p = 0.14). Similarly, the 
difference in complication rates between women with breech and cephalic 
presentation was not statistically significant (p = 0.094). The difference in 
complication rates between women who delivered preterm, at term, or post-term 
was also not statistically significant (p = 0.578). Furthermore, the association 
between complications during pregnancy and pregnancy-associated maternal 
diseases was not statistically significant (p = 1.00). Conclusion DDH is a 
significant health issue in newborns, leading to long-term mobility problems and 
discomfort. Positive family history of DDH is a significant risk factor. Breech 
presentation was not significantly associated with DDH in preterm children, and 
no significant associations were found between complications during pregnancy 
and various factors. Early detection and treatment of DDH are crucial for 
preventing long-term complications. Family history should be considered an 
important risk factor, emphasizing the need for screening programs in families 
with a history of DDH.

INTRODUCTION: Joint Advisory Group (JAG) certification in endoscopy is awarded 
when trainees attain minimum competency standards for independent practice. A 
national evidence-based review was undertaken to update standards for training 
and certification in flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS).
METHODS: A modified Delphi process was conducted between 2019 and 2020 with 
multisociety representation from experts and trainees. Following literature 
review and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations 
appraisal, recommendation statements on FS training and certification were 
formulated and subjected to anonymous voting to obtain consensus. Accepted 
statements were peer-reviewed by national stakeholders for incorporation into 
the JAG FS certification pathway.
RESULTS: In total, 41 recommendation statements were generated under the domains 
of: definition of competence (13), acquisition of competence (17), assessment of 
competence (7) and postcertification support (4). The consensus process led to 
revised criteria for colonoscopy certification, comprising: (A) achieving key 
performance indicators defined within British Society of Gastroenterology 
standards (ie, rectal retroversion >90%, polyp retrieval rate >90%, patient 
comfort <10% with moderate-severe discomfort); (B) minimum procedure count ≥175; 
(C) performing 15+ procedures over the preceding 3 months; (D) attendance of the 
JAG Basic Skills in Lower gastrointestinal Endoscopy course; (E) satisfying 
requirements for formative direct observation of procedural skill (DOPS) and 
direct observation of polypectomy skill (SMSA level 1); (F) evidence of 
reflective practice as documented on the JAG Endoscopy Training System 
reflection tool and (G) successful performance in summative DOPS.
CONCLUSION: The UK standards for training and certification in FS have been 
updated to support training, uphold standards in FS and polypectomy, and provide 
support to the newly independent practitioner.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of TJ-107 
for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity in prospective, 
multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II 
trials using the functional assessment of cancer therapy/gynecologic oncology 
group 12-item neurotoxicity questionnaire (FACT-GOG-NTX-12).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients who were registered to the Goshajinkigan 
oxaliplatin neurotoxicity evaluation study (UMIN000002211) were analyzed. A 
NTX-12 from the validated FACT/GOG-NTX-12 was assessed before treatment and at 
the end of every 2 cycles.
RESULTS: The comparisons of the median scores for TJ-107 and the placebo at 8 
and 26 weeks were as follows: numbness or tingling in the hands (P = 0.5820), 
numbness or tingling in the feet (P = 0.3236), feeling of discomfort in the 
hands (P = 0.8219), feeling of discomfort in the feet (P = 0.5361), joint pain 
or muscle cramps (P = 0.1974), feeling weak all over (P = 0.2771), trouble 
hearing (P = 0.2832), ringing or buzzing in ears (P = 0.1031), trouble buttoning 
buttons (P = 0.1653), trouble feeling the shape of small objects when held in 
hand (P = 0.2919), trouble walking (P = 0.5406), and pain in the hands or feet 
when exposed to cold temperatures (P = 0.1872).
CONCLUSION: There might be no clinically significant difference between the use 
of TJ-107 and the severity and quality of life for patients treated with 
oxaliplatin.

INTRODUCTION: In the UK, endoscopy certification is awarded when trainees attain 
minimum competency standards for independent practice. A national evidence-based 
review was undertaken to update and develop standards and recommendations for 
colonoscopy training and certification.
METHODS: Under the oversight of the Joint Advisory Group (JAG), a modified 
Delphi process was conducted between 2019 and 2020 with multisociety expert 
representation. Following literature review and Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment, Development and Evaluations appraisal, recommendation statements on 
colonoscopy training and certification were formulated and subjected to 
anonymous voting to obtain consensus. Accepted statements were peer reviewed by 
JAG and relevant stakeholders for incorporation into the updated colonoscopy 
certification pathway.
RESULTS: In total, 45 recommendation statements were generated under the domains 
of: definition of competence (13), acquisition of competence (20), assessment of 
competence (8) and postcertification support (4). The consensus process led to 
revised criteria for colonoscopy certification, comprising: (1) achieving key 
performance indicators defined within British Society of Gastroenterology 
standards (ie, unassisted caecal intubation rate >90%, rectal retroversion >90%, 
polyp detection rate >15%+, polyp retrieval rate >90%, patient comfort <10% with 
moderate-severe discomfort); (2) minimum procedure count 280+; (3) performing 
15+ procedures over the preceding 3 months; (4) attendance of the JAG Basic 
Skills in Colonoscopy course; (5) terminal ileal intubation rates of 60%+ in 
inflammatory bowel disease; (6) satisfying requirements for formative direct 
observation of procedure skills (DOPS) and direct observation of polypectomy 
skills (Size, Morphology, Site, Access (SMSA) level 2); (7) evidence of 
reflective practice as documented on the JAG Endoscopy Training System 
reflection tool; (8) successful performance in summative DOPS.
CONCLUSION: The UK standards for training and certification in colonoscopy have 
been updated, culminating in a single-stage certification process with emphasis 
on polypectomy competency (SMSA Level 2+). These standards are intended to 
support training, improve standards of colonoscopy and polypectomy, and provide 
support to the newly independent practitioner.

OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the clinical and radiological effects of precise 
unilateral puncture pathway prepared by preoperative CT data and traditional 
unilateral puncture pathway in PVP administration for the treatment of 
osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Summary of background data. PVP is 
a commonly used vertebral augmentation operation for the treatment of painful 
spinal compression fractures. A percutaneous unilateral approach is routinely 
used to get access to the vertebral body. PVP has had positive clinical results 
in a number of prior investigations. Numerous difficulties and issues, including 
puncture difficulty, radiation exposure, cement leakage, spinal cord or nerve 
damage, and intraspinal hematoma, have been described in contrast.
METHODS: This prospective study included 300 patients with single-level lumbar 
osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, 180 females and 120 males, with an 
average age of 71.5 years. PVP was performed on randomized subjects using two 
distinct puncture procedures. The patients were separated into two groups: 
Preoperative planning, in which a precise unilateral puncture path was 
established using preoperative CT data, and Conventional planning, in which 
multiple puncture procedures were used. The participants were followed up on 
after surgery and mostly assessed on clinical and radiological results. The 
visual analogue scale for pain and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
questionnaire for health status were used to assess clinical outcomes. Radiation 
dosage, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle were 
used to evaluate radiological results.
RESULTS: Participants remained monitored for 12 to 28 months on average. 151 
individuals were treated with accurate unilateral puncture paths planned by 
preoperative CT data percutaneous vertebroplasty and 149 patients were treated 
with conventional unilateral paths percutaneous vertebroplasty. The Preoperative 
planning group's operation time and radiation dose were significantly lower than 
the Conventional group's; nevertheless, the volume of injected cement was 
significantly higher in the Preoperative steering committee than in the 
Conventional group. All patients in both groups had much less pain after the 
operations when compared to their preoperative suffering. There were no 
statistically significant variations between groups when the visual analogue 
scale and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared. Neither group 
showed a substantial decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. In 
the Preoperative planning group, the kyphotic angle improved much more than in 
the Conventional group. At 1 month postoperatively, 16 patients in the 
Conventional group experienced apparent discomfort in the puncture sites because 
to facet joint violation. At the latest follow-up, all of the patients' 
discomfort had vanished after receiving local block therapy.
CONCLUSION: Both preoperatively designed precise unilateral puncture pathways 
and traditional unilateral puncture procedures PVP are reasonably safe and 
effective for individuals with painful osteoporotic spinal compression 
fractures. Unilateral puncture courses planned via preoperative PVP, on the 
other hand, absorbed less radiation and operation time, as well as a good level 
of deformity correction and amount of injected cement, and caused less 
complications than traditional unilateral PVP.

INTRODUCTION: The Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort-Sicca Symptoms 
Inventory-Short Form (PROFAD-SSI-SF) is a 19-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
measure to assess pain, fatigue, and dryness in patients with primary Sjögren's 
syndrome (pSS). This analysis identified concepts important to measure, and 
evaluated the content validity and measurement properties of the PROFAD-SSI-SF, 
in patients with pSS.
METHODS: Qualitative analyses (GSK Study 208396) used transcripts from an online 
concept elicitation (CE) discussion forum with patients with pSS and interviews 
with key opinion leaders (KOLs) to finalize a disease model depicting important 
concepts for patients with pSS. Cognitive debriefing (CD) interviews with 
patients with pSS were conducted to further evaluate the content validity of the 
PROFAD-SSI-SF. Quantitative analyses (GSK Study 213253) used post hoc analyses 
of blinded data from a phase 2 trial to assess PROFAD-SSI-SF measurement 
properties.
RESULTS: The CE discussion forum (N = 46) revealed dryness (oral 87.0%, ocular 
73.9%, cutaneous 37.0%, vaginal 23.9%, nasal 15.2%, otic 6.5%), pain (89.1%), 
and fatigue (87.0%) as the most reported symptoms. KOLs (N = 5) found the 
concepts identified in the disease model accurate and understandable, and 
confirmed that PROs used in pSS studies should focus on dryness, joint pain, and 
fatigue. In the CD interviews (N = 20), of the 19 participants asked, all found 
the PROFAD-SSI-SF easy to understand, and 14/19 items were considered relevant 
by ≥ 18/20 participants. The quantitative analyses found an acceptable fit of 
the PROFAD-SSI-SF factor structure, with adequate internal consistency, 
test-retest reliability, convergent validity with other PRO measures, 
known-groups validity with Patient Global Assessment, and ability to detect 
change in patients with pSS.
CONCLUSION: The final disease model confirmed that the PROFAD-SSI-SF assesses 
concepts that are relevant and important to patients with pSS. Our findings 
support the content validity and measurement properties of the PROFAD-SSI-SF as 
a fit-for-purpose PRO measure appropriate for use in clinical trials in patients 
with pSS. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER FOR THE PHASE 2 TRIAL: 
Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02631538.

Plain Language Summary: Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is a disease where the 
immune system attacks the body, causing a number of symptoms, most notably 
dryness (sicca) of the eyes and mouth. The Profile of Fatigue and 
Discomfort–Sicca Symptoms Inventory–Short Form (PROFAD-SSI-SF) is a 
questionnaire for patients with pSS that asks about their symptoms. This paper 
evaluates how relevant the PROFAD-SSI-SF questions are to patients with pSS, and 
how consistently and accurately the questionnaire can measure changes in their 
symptoms. We reviewed information about the symptoms and impacts of pSS from an 
online discussion forum for patients with pSS. Patients said that dryness, 
fatigue, and pain were the symptoms that most affected their day-to-day lives 
and well-being. We combined this information with previous research on pSS to 
design a diagram explaining the key symptoms and day-to-day impacts of pSS, 
which was reviewed by five experts in pSS. In doing so, we aimed to confirm 
whether the most important things to patients about living with pSS are asked in 
the PROFAD-SSI-SF questionnaire. Next, we asked 20 patients with pSS how easy 
they found the PROFAD-SSI-SF to complete and if any important concepts were 
missing; they reported that the PROFAD-SSI-SF was easy to fill in and that the 
important questions were included. Finally, we looked at data from a clinical 
trial that used the PROFAD-SSI-SF and found it accurately measures changes in 
symptoms of patients with pSS. This means that the PROFAD-SSI-SF could be used 
in clinical trials to help assess new medicines for pSS.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of different nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs combined with platelet-rich plasma on inflammatory 
factor levels in patients with osteoarthritis.
METHODS: The clinic data of 120 patients with osteoarthritis who were treated in 
our hospital (June 2019-June 2021) were retrospectively reviewed. All the 
patients were given platelet-rich plasma. According to the different 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs the patients received, they were equalized 
into diclofenac sodium group, celecoxib group, and iguratimod group, with 40 
cases in each group. After treatment, the patients' clinical efficacy was 
compared and analyzed.
RESULTS: After treatment, the pain degrees of the patients in the three groups 
were gradually reduced. After 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment, the statistical 
differences in the scores of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were found among the 
three groups. Specifically, compared with the other two groups, the iguratimod 
group had remarkably lower VAS scores (P < 0.05) and the celecoxib group had 
signally lower VAS scores compared with the diclofenac sodium group (P < 0.05). 
After treatment, the inflammatory factor levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in 
the diclofenac sodium group were observably higher compared with the celecoxib 
group (P < 0.05), and the inflammatory factor levels in the celecoxib group were 
remarkably higher compared with the iguratimod group (P < 0.05). Before 
treatment, no notable difference in the Lysholm scores was found among the three 
groups, and the patients' knee joint function was gradually improved after 
treatment. To be specific, after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, the iguratimod 
group had observably higher Lysholm scores compared with the other two groups (P 
< 0.05), and the celecoxib group had signally higher Lysholm scores compared 
with the diclofenac sodium group (P < 0.05). The iguratimod group got markedly 
lower Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) score compared with the 
celecoxib group (P < 0.05); Compared with the diclofenac sodium group, the 
celecoxib group got remarkably lower WOMAC score (P < 0.05). During treatment, 
few patients suffered from mild gastrointestinal discomfort and hepatic 
dysfunction in the three groups, and no other severe adverse reactions were 
found. No statistical difference in the total incidence of adverse reactions 
among the three groups was observed (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with 
platelet-rich plasma can further reduce the inflammatory reactions of the 
patients with osteoarthritis and improve their knee joint function. 
Significantly, the iguratimod, with high safety, has observably better effects 
on inhibiting inflammatory factors and improving knee joint function compared 
with diclofenac sodium and celecoxib.

BACKGROUND: We present a European multicenter study, comparing safety data and 
patient-reported outcomes (PRO) from patients undergoing synovial biopsy using 
ultrasound-guided needle biopsy (US-NB), ultrasound-guided portal and forceps 
(US-P&F) or arthroscopic-guided (AG) procedures.
OBJECTIVES: To describe safety and PRO data on joint indices of pain, stiffness 
and swelling before and after biopsy, procedural discomfort, joint status 
compared with before biopsy and willingness to undergo a second biopsy for each 
technique and compare the three techniques. To evaluate the impact on PRO and 
safety data of corticosteroid therapy as part of the biopsy procedure and 
sequential biopsy procedures.
METHODS: Data were collected on the day of biopsy and 7-14 days postprocedure. 
Joint pain, swelling and stiffness indices were recorded as 0-100  mm Visual 
Analogue Scale; qualitative outcome variables on five-point Likert scales. 
Groups were compared with linear regression, adjusting for disease activity, 
corticosteroid therapy and prebiopsy PRO value and accounting for repeated 
measurements.
RESULTS: A total of 524 synovial biopsy procedures were documented (402 US-NB, 
65 US-P&F and 57 AGSB). There were eight adverse events (1.5%) with no 
difference between biopsy methods (p=0.55). All PROs were improved 2  weeks 
postprocedure, and there were no differences in postbiopsy change in PROs 
between biopsy methods. Corticosteroid administration, whether intramuscular 
(n=62) or intra-articular (n=38), did not result in more adverse events (p=0.81) 
and was associated with reduction in postbiopsy swelling (p<0.01). Sequential 
biopsy procedures (n=103 patients) did not result in more adverse events 
(p=0.61) or worsening in PRO data.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results do not suggest a significant difference in 
safety or patient tolerability between US-NB, US-P&F and AGSB sampling. Further, 
corticosteroid therapy as part of the biopsy procedure and sequential biopsies 
is safe and well tolerated in patients.

As cardiovascular disease stands as a global primary cause of mortality, there 
has been an urgent need for continuous and real-time heart monitoring to 
effectively identify irregular heart rhythms and to offer timely patient alerts. 
However, conventional cardiac monitoring systems encounter challenges due to 
inflexible interfaces and discomfort during prolonged monitoring. In this review 
article, we address these issues by emphasizing the recent development of the 
flexible, wearable, and comfortable piezoelectric passive sensor assisted by 
machine learning technology for diagnosis. This innovative device not only 
harmonizes with the dynamic mechanical properties of human skin but also 
facilitates continuous and real-time collection of physiological signals. 
Addressing identified challenges and constraints, this review provides insights 
into recent advances in piezoelectric cardiac sensors, from devices to circuit 
systems. Furthermore, this review delves into the integration of machine 
learning technologies, showcasing their pivotal role in facilitating continuous 
and real-time assessment of cardiac status. The synergistic combination of 
flexible piezoelectric sensor design and machine learning holds substantial 
potential in automating the detection of cardiac irregularities with minimal 
human intervention. This transformative approach has the power to revolutionize 
patient care paradigms.

Metatarsal fractures are one of the most common injuries after foot trauma. It 
is debilitating, as the metatarsals are one of the most crucial bones for any 
weight-bearing movement. This report demonstrates the beneficial outcome of 
using Kirschner wires (K-wires) in a trauma setting and the complicated healing 
process. A 56-year-old gentleman was brought into the emergency department after 
a reinforced cement pipe fell onto the patient's steel-toe boots, striking his 
left foot immediately proximal to the steel portion of the boot. The patient had 
sustained displaced comminuted fractures of the left second, third, fourth, and 
fifth metatarsals with an extensive open wound (Gustilo type II open fracture). 
Open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) was performed using K-wires to 
restore and preserve the anatomical and functional integrity of the foot. 
Following the surgery, the patient developed a hammer toe of the left fifth 
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint two months after the ORIF; we performed 
resection arthroplasty to relieve discomfort and further aid the recovery 
process. Following the resection arthroplasty, eschar had formed at the surgical 
site, extending from the lateral aspect of the left foot to the plantar surface, 
for which we had performed a skin graft after excisional debridement of the 
necrotic tissue. After one year of close follow-ups with rigorous physical 
therapy exercises, the patient had a fair recovery process and is now able to 
ambulate without any assistive devices. As such, using K-wires remains a viable 
option for reducing misaligned metatarsal fractures and providing fairly good 
outcomes even in the setting of severe foot trauma.

BACKGROUND: Mandibular retraction is the main etiological mechanism of class II 
malocclusion in China and the subsequent distal molar relationship can cause 
functional discomfort in mastication, breathing and the temporomandibular joint. 
The use of mandibular advancement (MA) devices has recently emerged as an 
adolescent mandibular retraction treatment; however, current studies regarding 
the effect thereof are relatively few, and there is lack of sufficient clinical 
support.
AIM: To investigate the clinical effect of invisalign MA on the treatment of 
mandibular retraction in adolescents.
METHODS: This study included 30 adolescent patients who underwent treatment with 
the MA appliances from December 2017 to June 2021. The lateral cephalometric 
data before and after treatment were collected and imported into Dolphin Imaging 
software. The changes were measured by linear measurement superimposed with 
lateral cephalometric trajectory based on the Pancherz technology.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the length and position of 
maxilla before and after the treatment. The position of the mandible moved 3.13 
mm, the length increased 4.14 mm, the mandibular ramus length increased 4.09 mm, 
the body length increased 4.25 mm, and the position of the condyle moved 1.03 mm 
forward after treatment. Additionally, changes in the incisor sagittal position 
and labial inclination were observed. The position of the upper incisor point 
moved back 1.33 mm, without statistical difference, the inclination and tooth 
angle decreased by 3.44° and 4.06°, respectively; the position of the lower 
incisor point was moved 2.98 mm, and the inclination and tooth angle increased 
by 2.62° and 1.23°, respectively. Furthermore, changes in the incisor overjet 
and molar relationship were seen. Overjet decreased by 4.31 mm, of which 1.78 mm 
was due to dental factors, accounting for 41.3% of the effect as opposed to 
58.7% due to skeletal factors. Molar relationship improved 3.87 mm, with 1.34 mm 
due to dental factors, and dental and skeletal factors were accounted for 34.6% 
and 65.4% of the effect, respectively.
CONCLUSION: For adolescent patients with mandible retraction, invisalign MA can 
effectively promote the mandible growth, and it was proven to be mainly due to 
skeletal effects.

BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a great variability of 
symptoms that affect all organs and systems of the body has been identified in 
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; this symptomatology can sometimes persist 
over time, giving rise to the so-called long COVID or post-COVID. The aim of 
this study is to delve into the clinical characterization of these patients, as 
well as to take into account the influence of factors such as hospitalization, 
admission to ICU, history of pneumonia, or vaccination status on the persistence 
of symptoms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive, multicenter, and 
retrospective study was designed with a series of cases of people who presented 
long COVID, which includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. 
Data were obtained from an online ad hoc questionnaire, and statistical analysis 
was performed using SPSS Software Version 25 (IBM-Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS: Hospitalization, ICU admission, history of pneumonia, and vaccination 
were predictive factors (positive or negative) for the following long-COVID 
symptoms: headache, menstrual disorders, joint pain, cough, chills, nasal 
congestion, back pain, abdominal pain, weight loss, eye discomfort, facial 
erythema, itching, tremors, dizziness, seizures, sleeping difficulty, dry eyes, 
palpitations, fatigue, paresthesia, dyspnea, aphonia, chest pain, high blood 
pressure, vomiting, memory loss, brain fog, hypothermia, low blood pressure, 
sputum or phlegm, lack of concentration, hair loss, and erectile dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence on the clinical characterization of 
patients suffering from long COVID in order to offer them the most appropriate 
treatments.

BACKGROUND: While surgical stabilisation of the subtalar joint (arthroeresis) in 
children remains controversial in the USA, it is widely practised worldwide, 
with reportedly good outcomes. We are presenting a series of patients who met 
our criteria for calcaneal lengthening, but whose parents chose the less 
invasive option of talo-tarsal stabilisation (TTS). The goal of this surgery was 
to forestall or prevent hindfoot osteotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With IRB approval, we conducted this retrospective review 
of 32 patients (60 ft), who underwent TTS for flexible planovalgus deformity and 
had a minimum of 1-year follow-up. The aetiology was idiopathic for the 
majority, with a few being neurogenic or syndromic. The age range was 6-15 
years; the younger patients had neuromuscular aetiology or underlying syndromes. 
Concomitant procedures included percutaneous Achilles lengthening (33 ft), 
Kidner (9 ft) and guided growth for ankle valgus (2).
RESULTS: In the early post-immobilisation phase, peroneal spasm occurred in four 
patients (6 ft). This resolved with Botox injection in the peroneus brevis in 
three patients and required transfer of the peroneus brevis to the peroneus 
longus in one patient. At follow-up, ranging from 1 to 4.5 years, 50 implants 
(83.4%) were retained and the patients reported satisfactory outcomes. 
Henceforth, those patients will be monitored on a p.r.n. basis. Due to lingering 
discomfort, implants were repositioned in one and removed in five patients (10 
ft = 16.6%). Upon further follow-up, these patients have not manifested 
recurrent deformity. Therefore, subsequent salvage by osteotomy and/or 
lengthening of the calcaneus has not been necessary.
CONCLUSION: TTS for the symptomatic flatfoot, combined with other procedures as 
indicated, offers advantages over the currently more accepted methods of medial 
shift osteotomy or calcaneal lengthening. The outcome at 1 year is a good 
forecast of whether or not further treatment will be required. This is a simpler 
and preferred option as compared to other methods of surgical management and, in 
our experience, has obviated the need for osteotomy or lengthening of the 
calcaneus.

Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) devices are used in rehabilitation to 
improve patients' walking function. While there are some reports on the adverse 
events (AEs) and associated risks in overground exoskeletons, the risks of 
stationary gait trainers cannot be accurately assessed. We therefore aimed to 
collect information on AEs occurring during the use of stationary gait robots 
and identify associated risks, as well as gaps and needs, for safe use of these 
devices. We searched both bibliographic and full-text literature databases for 
peer-reviewed articles describing the outcomes of stationary RAGT and 
specifically mentioning AEs. We then compiled information on the occurrence and 
types of AEs and on the quality of AE reporting. Based on this, we analyzed the 
risks of RAGT in stationary gait robots. We included 50 studies involving 985 
subjects and found reports of AEs in 18 of those studies. Many of the AE reports 
were incomplete or did not include sufficient detail on different aspects, such 
as severity or patient characteristics, which hinders the precise counts of 
AE-related information. Over 169 device-related AEs experienced by between 79 
and 124 patients were reported. Soft tissue-related AEs occurred most frequently 
and were mostly reported in end-effector-type devices. Musculoskeletal AEs had 
the second highest prevalence and occurred mainly in exoskeleton-type devices. 
We further identified physiological AEs including blood pressure changes that 
occurred in both exoskeleton-type and end-effector-type devices. Training in 
stationary gait robots can cause injuries or discomfort to the skin, underlying 
tissue, and musculoskeletal system, as well as unwanted blood pressure changes. 
The underlying risks for the most prevalent injury types include excessive 
pressure and shear at the interface between robot and human (cuffs/harness), as 
well as increased moments and forces applied to the musculoskeletal system 
likely caused by misalignments (between joint axes of robot and human). There is 
a need for more structured and complete recording and dissemination of AEs 
related to robotic gait training to increase knowledge on risks. With this 
information, appropriate mitigation strategies can and should be developed and 
implemented in RAGT devices to increase their safety.

BACKGROUND: The severity of menopausal symptoms negatively impacts a woman's 
quality of life (QoL).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of 
menopause-related impaired QoL and determine its associated factors among 
postmenopausal women living in slum areas of Bhubaneswar, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 198 
postmenopausal women aged 45-65 years during the year 2016-2017. The Menopause 
Rating Scale (MRS) was used to assess the prevalence and severity of menopausal 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Joint and muscular discomfort was the most prevalent moderate-to-severe 
symptom (90.4%), followed by hot flushes (72.8%), irritability (67.2%), and 
physical and mental exhaustion (64.2%). More than two-third (133, 67.2%) of 
women had impaired QoL (severe total MRS score ≥17). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis revealed that impaired QoL was associated younger age 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12-9.98), 
tobacco consumption (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.05-3.82), not being satisfied in 
relation with husband (AOR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.84-6.06), not having autonomy in 
health-care decision-making in the family (AOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.12-4.73), 
history of reproductive tract infection (AOR: 4.57, 95% CI: 1.71-12.19), and 
earlier onset of menopause (AOR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.18-8.96).
CONCLUSION: The point prevalence of menopause-related impaired QOL in 
postmenopausal women living in slums of Bhubaneswar was high. Incorporating 
these determinants in the existing strategies can be useful to improve the QoL 
of these women.

Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.z.javadivala@yahoo.com.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was (a) to assess the relationship 
between physical activity and the intensity and duration of menopausal symptoms, 
(b) to investigate the relationship between physical activity and the four 
domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and (c) to assess the 
relationship between physical activity and chronic diseases.
METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study that was conducted in Tabriz City, 
Iran. Data were collected in 2012 by personal home-based interviews, using 
structured questionnaires. All participants (n= 273), who were middle-aged (age 
range of 40-60 yr) were recruited from two of the 25 urban health service 
centers' clients, by clustered random sampling allocation.
RESULTS: There was a positive significant relationship between Psychological, 
Social, and Environmental domains of HRQOL with physical activity (P<0.001). In 
addition, a negative significant relation was found between somatic complaints 
including sexual problems (P< 0.017) and vaginal dryness (P<0.030) as well as 
joint-muscular discomfort (P<0.018), and the level of physical activity. 
Diabetic (P<0.047) and women with history of heart disease (P<0.040) performed 
2.670 and 3.548 hours more than who were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Regular physical activity would be effective in decreasing 
menopausal symptoms as well as improving healthy aging and also physical 
activity promotion as a part of healthy life style promotion programs needs to 
be improved in communities where women are physically inactive. In addition, 
women need to be informed about importance of physical activity on their life 
which it leads to feel healthy aging and pre and post- menopausal stages.

Oslo, Norway: Knowledge Centre for the Health Services at The Norwegian 
Institute of Public Health (NIPH); 2013 Sep. Report from Norwegian Knowledge 
Centre for the Health Services (NOKC) No. 12-2013.
NIPH Systematic Reviews: Executive Summaries.

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the effects of task 
sharing for some selected procedures in hospitals. For four of the six 
procedures, we found no evidence that met our criteria for inclusion. Based on 
evidence assessed as being from low to very low quality we draw the following 
conclusions for two of six questions: What are the effects of task sharing 
between doctors and nurses for patients undergoing endoscopy? There may not be 
large differences for patient outcomes such as: pain/discomfort, 
gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life. For the outcomes: need of 
assistance, duration, number of polyps missed, depth of sigmoidoscopy, number of 
biopsies, immediate complications and costs we cannot, on the basis of the 
evidence, determine whether there are important differences between endoscopy 
performed by nurses or by doctors. . What are the effects of task sharing 
between doctors and nurses for patients followed up in outpatient clinics? 
Patients with bronchiectasis: there may not be large differences in quality of 
life or the number of hospitalisations per patient. However, it is possible that 
there may be greater costs associated with the use of nurses. For the outcomes: 
lung function, lung capacity, exacerbations due to infection and training 
capacity we cannot, on the basis of the evidence, determine whether there are 
important differences for patients between follow-up by nurses or by doctors. 
Patients with asthma: there may not be large differences in quality of life, 
hospitalisation per patient or costs. For outcomes: number of symptom-free days, 
lung function, number of medication-free days, maximum air flow or the number of 
exacerbations we cannot, on the basis of the evidence, decide whether there are 
important differences for patients between follow-up by nurses or by doctors. 
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis: patient satisfaction may be somewhat 
improved due to follow-up by nurses rather than rheumatologists. For general 
health outcomes: joint pain, fatigue, global assessment of disease activity and 
disease activity measured by DAS 28 it is possible that there are no large 
differences between follow-up by nurses or by rheumatologists. Adults with 
cancer: nurses may use more time on consultation and take more blood tests, but 
there may not be large differences for patient satisfaction if cancer patients 
are followed up by a doctor or nurse. For the outcomes: mental health, 
depression, occurrence of metastases or overall costs we cannot, on the basis of 
the evidence, decide whether there are important differences for patients 
between follow-up by nurses or doctors.

We have investigated how medical postponement, the time to surgery and the 
correction of medical abnormalities, according to McLaughlin criteria, before 
operation affected peri-operative mortality after fracture of the hip. From 
February to December 2007, in addition to core data, the Scottish Hip Fracture 
Audit collected information relating to surgical delay. Data were available for 
4284 patients which allowed 30-day survival analysis to be performed. 
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to control for differences in 
case-mix. Patients with major clinical abnormalities were more likely to have a 
postponement and had a lower unadjusted 30-day survival. The time to operation 
and postponement were not associated with higher mortality after adjustment for 
case-mix. Correction of major clinical abnormalities before surgery improved the 
adjusted survival, but this improvement was not significant (p = 0.10). 
Postponement without correction of a medical abnormality before surgery was 
associated with a significantly lower (p = 0.006) 30-day adjusted survival. The 
possible benefits of postponement need to be weighed against prolonged 
discomfort for the patient and the possibility of the development of other 
complications.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 
interferential current treatment on a range of motion of joint and shoulder 
pain, functional status, and quality of life in patients with subacromial 
impingement syndrome and to compare interferential current with transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation and sham interferential current.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients complaining of shoulder discomfort participated 
in the present study. Diagnosis of subacromial impingement syndrome is based on 
anamnesis, clinical examinations, and shoulder magnetic resonance imaging. A 
total of 52 patients divided into 3 groups: Group 1 (17 patients, mean age 51.8 
years) received interferential current, group 2 (18 patients, mean age 51.8 
years) received transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and group 3 (17 
patients, mean age 49.1 years) received sham interferential current. Hot pack 
and exercise treatments were added to all groups. All groups were treated for 3 
weeks, 5 times a week, for 15 sessions and 20 minutes for each session. 
Evaluations were made before treatment (T0), in the middle of treatment (T1; end 
of 8th session), and at the end of treatment (T2; end of 15th session) using 
active range of motion and visual analog scale for pain, the Arm, Shoulder, and 
Hand Problems Questionnaire for functional status, and Short Form-36 for quality 
of life.
RESULTS: There were significant improvement effects on all of the range of 
motion, visual analog scale, and the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Problems 
Questionnaire scores at T2 and on the scores in some subparameters of Short 
Form-36 in all groups (P < .05). However, there was no statistically significant 
difference at T2 between the groups (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Interferential current and transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation exhibited equivalent results regarding range of motion, pain, 
function, and quality of life of patients with subacromial impingement syndrome, 
with no significant difference between interferential current and transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation. Adding interferential current or transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation treatments to hot pack +exercise therapy did not 
result in any extra benefits to the patients.

To investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of Demodex folliculorum 
(DF) in the eyelashes of healthy young males. An epidemiological cross-sectional 
prevalence study was conducted. We conducted visual acuity, eye-related 
examination, eyelash microscopic examination and DF count of recruits in Fujian 
Province in 2019. The presence of DF was analyzed according to age, 
keratorefractive surgery, annual household income, educational level, long-term 
residence, sleep time, time of using electronic products, smoking and drinking 
habit. A total of 2253 healthy young males (aged 17-24 years) were studied for 
the presence of DF within eyelash follicles. The total prevalence of DF was 
20.73% in our study. Subjects with history of keratorefractive surgery had a 
statistically significant increase in the prevalence of DF (P < 0.001). The 
prevalence of DF was higher in subjects with ocular symptoms than in those 
without symptoms (P < 0.05). Factors such as the educational level and so on we 
analyzed had no significant correlation with the prevalence of DF (all 
P > 0.05). According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the 
history of keratorefractive surgery was the risk factors of DF infection 
(P < 0.001), and the risk of infection was 1.437 times higher in the population 
with the history of keratorefractive surgery than in the population without. 
There was no correlation between ocular discomfort and DF infection (P > 0.05). 
The prevalence of DF in eyelash follicles in healthy young males was relatively 
high. The history of keratorefractive surgery was an important risk factor for 
the infection.

BACKGROUND: During regional anesthesia, including combined spinal and epidural 
anesthesia (CSEA), patients may develop a perceptual alteration of limb position 
known as phantom limb syndrome (PLS). We aimed to identify factors that 
influence the PLS onset, to explore whether PLS predisposes to other 
postoperative symptoms, and to document the relationship between PLS and 
sensorimotor impairment during recovery.
METHODS: Psychological questionnaires for anxiety and depression were completed 
beforehand, then multimodal tests of sensory and motor function, especially 
tests of proprioception, were performed regularly afterward. Two hundred 
participants undergoing elective gynecological surgery under CSEA reported their 
experiences of PLS and other symptoms using Likert rating scales.
RESULTS: Prolonged preoperative fasting (odds ratio (OR) 2.34; 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) 1.21-4.52), and surgical history (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.16-5.62) 
predisposed to PLS, but patients with more extensive anesthetic histories may be 
at lower risk (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.31-1.08). Furthermore, significant correlations 
were observed between the recovery from PLS and the perception of joint movement 
within the deafferented area (R = 0.82, P < .01) and motor functions (R = 0.68). 
PLS increases the chance of experiencing postoperative fatigue, physical 
discomfort, and emotional upset.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to have identified the risk factors for PLS, 
assessed the relationship between PLS and postoperative sensorimotor impairment, 
and its influence on postoperative complications.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases have become the leading cause of death 
around the globe and diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered to be a coronary 
artery disease (CAD) risk equivalent. Ranolazine, an anti anginal drug has been 
found to reduce Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in diabetes patients with chronic 
angina. However the effect of another antianginal drug trimetazidine, on 
glycemic status is not clear.
AIM: To compare the effect of ranolazine and trimetazidine on glycemic status in 
diabetic patients with CAD.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with CAD and diabetes mellitus attending 
Cardiology Out Patient Department (OPD), Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate 
Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India were recruited for this 
randomized open label parallel arm trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study conducted from January-2012 to April-2013 had 
47 eligible patients diagnosed with CAD and diabetes mellitus. They were 
randomized to receive either ranolazine 500 mg BD or trimetazidine 35 mg BD for 
12 weeks. HbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile, QT and QTc 
intervals were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Unpaired t-test was used to compare the baseline 
characteristics of between the groups while comparison within the groups were 
done using Paired t-test. Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney U-tests were used for non 
parametric data. Graph pad instat version-3 was used for statistical analysis. 
Values were expressed as mean ± SD. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: The study could not find any change in HbA1c levels in both ranolazine 
and trimetazidine groups. The adverse effects reported from patients on 
ranolazine include angina, constipation, postural hypotension, headache, 
dizziness, nausea and weakness while patients on trimetazidine complained of 
constipation, weakness, palpitations, angina, dizziness, nausea, dyspepsia, 
headache, gastric discomfort, joint pain, etc.
CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic angina and diabetes mellitus Ranolazine 
500mg BD and Trimetazidine 35mg BD did not show any effect on HbA1c and fasting 
blood glucose lebel.

Human-perceived temperature (HPT) describes the joint effects of multiple 
climatic factors such as temperature and humidity. Extreme HPT events may reduce 
labor capacity and cause thermal discomfort and even mortality. These events are 
becoming more frequent and more intense under global warming, posing severe 
threats to human and natural systems worldwide, particularly in populated areas 
with intensive human activities, e.g., the North China Plain (NCP). Therefore, a 
fine-scale HPT dataset in both spatial and temporal dimensions is urgently 
needed. Here we construct a daily high-resolution (~1 km) human thermal index 
collection over NCP from 2003 to 2020 (HiTIC-NCP). This dataset contains 12 HPT 
indices and has high accuracy with averaged determination coefficient, mean 
absolute error, and root mean squared error of 0.987, 0.970 °C, and 1.292 °C, 
respectively. Moreover, it exhibits high spatiotemporal consistency with 
ground-level observations. The dataset provides a reference for human thermal 
environment and could facilitate studies such as natural hazards, regional 
climate change, and urban planning.

BACKGROUND: A common bariatric procedure known as gastric sleeve surgery can 
cause significant weight loss and co-morbid condition alleviation. However, 
patients could experience persistent problems such as gastrointestinal, 
musculoskeletal/neural, and psychiatric disorders after surgery. This study aims 
to identify the most prevalent chronic symptoms following sleeve gastrectomy 
among a sample of Saudi patients and the impact these symptoms have on patients' 
lives.
METHODOLOGY: Patients who underwent gastric sleeve surgery at the Ensan Clinic, 
a facility specializing in gastroenterology, were the subjects of this 
retrospective cohort analysis. The study population consisted of patients who 
underwent gastric sleeve surgery, showed up for follow-up after the procedure, 
and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data collection sheet is 
divided into seven sections. Sociodemographic information was required in the 
first section, gastric sleeve surgery information in the second, vital signs in 
the third, lab results in the fourth, past medical history in the fifth, current 
treatments in the sixth, and postoperative complications and chronic symptoms in 
the seventh and final sections.
RESULTS: In 117 patients, the study evaluated the effects of gastric sleeve 
surgery. Participants had an average age of 40.21 years, and 61.5% were female. 
Regarding persistent symptoms after surgery, a sizable percentage of patients 
mentioned digestive issues such as GERD (44.4%), dyspepsia (60.7%), vomiting 
(23.1%), nausea (39.3%), and abdominal distention (45.3%). A total of 34.2% of 
patients reported experiencing anxiety, compared to 11.1% who said they had 
depression or 2.6% who said they had social issues. A few patients reported 
experiencing neurological or musculoskeletal issues, including exhaustion 
(7.7%), faintness (5.1%), back or joint discomfort (7.7%), and shortness of 
breath (8.5%).
CONCLUSION: After undergoing gastric sleeve surgery, a sizable proportion of 
patients complained of various chronic symptoms and nutritional inadequacies, 
primarily gastrointestinal problems and musculoskeletal/neurological issues. The 
study's findings show a connection between these symptoms and surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Glenohumeral (shoulder) dislocations are the most common large 
joint dislocations seen in the emergency department (ED). They cause pain, often 
severe, and require timely interventions to minimise discomfort and tissue 
damage. Commonly used reposition or relocation techniques often involve traction 
and/or leverage. These techniques have high success rates but may be painful and 
time consuming. They may also cause complications. Recently, other 
techniques-the biomechanical reposition techniques (BRTs)-have become more 
popular since they may cause less pain, require less time and cause fewer 
complications. To our knowledge, no research exists comparing the various BRTs. 
Our objective is to establish which BRT or BRT combination is fastest, least 
painful and associated with the lowest complication rate for adult ED patients 
with anterior glenohumeral dislocations (AGDs).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adults presenting to the participating EDs with isolated 
AGDs, as determined by radiographs, will be randomised to one of three BRTs: 
Cunningham, modified Milch or scapular manipulation. Main study 
parameters/endpoints are ED length of stay and patients' self-report of pain. 
Secondary study parameters/endpoints are procedure times, need for analgesic 
and/or sedative medications, iatrogenic complications and rates of successful 
reduction.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Non-biomechanical AGD repositioning techniques based 
on traction and/or leverage are inherently painful and potentially harmful. We 
believe that the three BRTs used in this study are more physiological, more 
patient friendly, less likely to cause pain, more time efficient and less likely 
to produce complications. By comparing these three techniques, we hope to 
improve the care provided to adults with acute AGDs by reducing their ED length 
of stay and minimising pain and procedure-related complications. We also hope to 
define which of the three BRTs is quickest, most likely to be successful and 
least likely to require sedative or analgesic medications to achieve reduction.

AIM: To evaluate the clinical pharmacist-led medication reconciliation process 
in clinical practice by quantifying and analyzing unintentional medication 
discrepancies at hospital admission.
METHODS: An observational prospective study was conducted at the Clinical 
Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Dubrava, during a 1-year 
period (October 2014 - September 2015) as a part of the implementation of Safe 
Clinical Practice, Medication Reconciliation of the European Network for Patient 
Safety and Quality of Care Joint Action (PASQ JA) project. Patients older than 
18 years taking at least one regular prescription medication were eligible for 
inclusion. Discrepancies between pharmacists' Best Possible Medication History 
(BPMH) and physicians' admission orders were detected and communicated directly 
to the physicians to clarify whether the observed changes in therapy were 
intentional or unintentional. All discrepancies were discussed by an expert 
panel and classified according to their potential to cause harm.
RESULTS: In 411 patients included in the study, 1200 medication discrepancies 
were identified, with 202 (16.8%) being unintentional. One or more unintentional 
medication discrepancy was found in 148 (35%) patients. The most frequent type 
of unintentional medication discrepancy was drug omission (63.9%) followed by an 
incorrect dose (24.2%). More than half (59.9%) of the identified unintentional 
medication discrepancies had the potential to cause moderate to severe 
discomfort or clinical deterioration in the patient.
CONCLUSION: Around 60% of medication errors were assessed as having the 
potential to threaten the patient safety. Clinical pharmacist-led medication 
reconciliation was shown to be an important tool in detecting medication 
discrepancies and preventing adverse patient outcomes. This standardized 
medication reconciliation process may be widely applicable to other health care 
organizations and clinical settings.

INTRODUCTION: Freiberg's disease is osteonecrosis of the dorsal side of a 
metatarsal head. The gold-standard surgical treatment is the osteotomy procedure 
first described by Gauthier.
HYPOTHESIS: Gauthier osteotomy for Freiberg's disease will restore the joint 
space and lead to long-term clinical improvement. A retrospective study was 
carried out to verify this hypothesis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study involved 30 consecutive cases treated by a 
single surgeon in 28 patients having a mean age of 61.2 years. These patients 
underwent the Gauthier osteotomy procedure with one or two dorsal staples used 
for fixation. Patients were reviewed 15 days, 45 days and 3 months after the 
procedure, and then at the last follow-up to look for any complications and 
determine patient satisfaction, the AOFAS score, metatarsophalangeal range of 
motion (ROM), sphericity of the metatarsal head, bone union and metatarsal 
shortening.
RESULTS: The average follow-up was 6.5 years ± 2.2. The second metatarsal was 
affected in 27 cases and the third metatarsal in 3 cases. Discomfort related to 
the staples was noted in five cases; the staples were removed in three of them. 
There was one case of severe stiffening (< 20° ROM). At the last follow-up, 17 
cases were very satisfied, 11 were satisfied and 2 were moderately satisfied. 
The average AOFAS score was 83.8 points ± 11.8 at the last follow-up. A mean 
loss of 15° plantar flexion and 10° dorsiflexion was noted. Bone union and 
metatarsal head sphericity were achieved in all cases. The average shortening 
was 2 mm ± 1.4.
CONCLUSIONS: The Gauthier osteotomy procedure results in recovery of the 
metatarsal head's sphericity in every case of this series, with good clinical 
results and low morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation is a common intervention to 
address muscle weakness, however presents with many limitations such as fatigue, 
muscle damage, and patient discomfort that may influence its effectiveness. One 
novel form of electrical stimulation purported to improve neuromuscular 
re-education is Patterned Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulation (PENS), which is 
proposed to mimic muscle-firing patterns of healthy individuals. PENS provides 
patterned stimulating to the agonist muscle, antagonist muscle and then agonist 
muscle again in an effort to replicate firing patterns.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a single PENS 
treatment on knee extension torque and quadriceps activation in individuals with 
quadriceps inhibition.
METHODS: 18 subjects (10 males and 8 females: 24.2±3.4 years, 175.3±11.8cm, 
81.8±12.4kg) with a history of knee injury/pain participated in this 
double-blinded randomized controlled laboratory trial. Participants demonstrated 
quadriceps inhibition with a central activation ratio of ≤90%. Maximal voluntary 
isometric contraction of the quadriceps and central activation ratio were 
measured before and after treatment. The treatment intervention was a 15-minute 
patterned electrical stimulation applied to the quadriceps and hamstring muscles 
with a strong motor contraction or a sham group, who received an identical set 
up as the PENS group, but received a 1mA subsensory stimulation. A 2×2 (group × 
time) ANCOVA was used to determine differences in maximal voluntary isometric 
contraction and central activation ratio between groups. The maximal voluntary 
isometric contraction was selected as a covariate due to baseline differences.
RESULTS: There were no differences in change scores between pre- and 
post-intervention for maximal voluntary isometric contraction: (PENS: 
0.09±0.32Nm/kg and Sham 0.15±0.18Nm/kg, p=0.713), or central activation 
ratio:(PENS: -1.22±6.06 and Sham: 1.48±3.7, p=0.270).
CONCLUSIONS: A single Patterned Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulation treatment 
did not alter quadriceps central activation ratio or maximal voluntary isometric 
contraction. Unlike other types of muscle stimulation, PENS did not result in a 
reduction of quadriceps torque.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

[Computerized occlusal analysis in bruxism].

[Article in Serbian]

Lazić V, Todorović A, Zivković S, Marinović Z.

INTRODUCTION: Sleep bruxism as nocturnal parafunction, also known as tooth 
grinding, is the most common parasomnia (sleep disorder). Most tooth grinding 
occurs during rapid eye movement - REM sleep. Sleep bruxism is an oral habit 
characterized by rhythmic activity of the masticatory muscles (m. masseter) that 
causes forced contact between dental surfaces during sleep. Sleep bruxism has 
been associated with craniomandibular disorders including temporomandibular 
joint discomfort, pulpalgia, premature loss of teeth due to excessive attrition 
and mobility, headache, muscle ache, sleep interruption of an individual and 
problems with removable and fixed denture. Basically, two groups of etiological 
factors can be distinguished, viz., peripheral (occlusal) factors and central 
(pathophysiological and psychological) factors. The role of occlusion (occlusal 
discrepancies) as the causative factor is not enough mentioned in relation to 
bruxism.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the connection 
between occlusal factors and nocturnal parafunctional activities (occlusal 
disharmonies and bruxism).
METHOD: Two groups were formed- experimental of 15 persons with signs and 
symptoms of nocturnal parafunctional activity of mandible (mean age 26.6 years) 
and control of 42 persons with no signs and symptoms of bruxism (mean age 26.3 
yrs.). The computerized occlusal analyses were performed using the T-Scan II 
system (Tekscan, Boston, USA). 2D occlusograms were analyzed showing the 
occlusal force, the center of the occlusal force with the trajectory and the 
number of antagonistic tooth contacts.
RESULTS: Statistically significant difference of force distribution was found 
between the left and the right side of the arch (L%-R%) (t=2.773; p<0.02) in the 
group with bruxism. The difference of the centre of occlusal force - COF 
trajectory between the experimental and control group was not significant, but 
the trajectory of COF was longer in the group of bruxists (67.3+24.4mm). In 
addition, the significant difference of COF position in relation to the center 
of the elliptic fields was not found in bruxists (chi-squared=1.63; p> 0.05), 
but obtained results directly revealed uneven distribution of the occlusal 
forces which caused the excessive attrition and mobility of tooth.
CONCLUSION: Our study failed to find direct correlation between occlusal factors 
and bruxism, so they are basically contributing factors.

INTRODUCTION: Multimodal characterisation with questionnaires, Quantitative 
Sensory Testing (QST), and neuroimaging will improve understanding of 
neuropathic pain (NeuP) in adolescents. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 
adolescents with NeuP are limited, and the perceived practical or ethical burden 
of scanning may represent a barrier to research.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of MRI scanning in adolescents with 
moderate-severe NeuP, with respect to consent rate, postscan acceptability, and 
data quality.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study evaluating questionnaires and QST 
recruited adolescents aged 10 to 18 years with clinically diagnosed NeuP from a 
tertiary clinic. Eligible adolescents aged 11 years and older could additionally 
agree/decline an MRI scan. After the scan, families rated discomfort, perceived 
risk, and acceptability of current and future MRI scans (0-10 numerical rating 
scales). Head motion during scanning was compared with healthy controls to 
assess data quality.
RESULTS: Thirty-four families agreed to MRI (72% recruitment), and 21 
adolescents with moderate-severe pain (average last week 6.7 ± 1.7; mean ± SD) 
and with neuropathic QST profiles were scanned. Three adolescents reported 
positional or noise-related discomfort during scanning. Perceived risk was low, 
and acceptability of the current scan was high for parents (range [median]: 7 to 
10/10 [10]) and adolescents (8-10/10 [10]). Willingness to undergo a future 
research scan was high for parents (7-10/10 [10]) and adolescents (5-10/10 [10]) 
and did not differ from future scans for clinical purposes. Mean head motion 
during resting state functional MRI did not differ from control adolescents.
CONCLUSION: Research MRI is feasible and acceptable for many adolescents with 
moderate-severe NeuP.

RATIONALE: Bone cement leakage is a common complication of percutaneous 
kyphoplasty (PKP) and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) surgery and has also 
been reported in posterior decompression and cement-enhanced pedicle screw 
fixation. When bone cement leaks through the venous system, it will have serious 
consequences and even endanger the life of the patient, especially when the bone 
cement causes intracardiac embolism.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old woman developed chest tightness and decreased 
blood oxygen saturation following posterior decompression and cement-enhanced 
pedicle screw fixation.
DIAGNOSIS: After the patient was given symptomatic treatment, the symptoms were 
not relieved, the high-sensitivity troponin I level continued to rise, the 
electrocardiogram results were abnormal, and chest computed tomography (CT) 
revealed multiple flaky and strip-shaped dense shadows in the heart.
INTERVENTION: The patient underwent removal of foreign bodies from the heart 
under cardiopulmonary bypass and tricuspid valvuloplasty, removal of 
intracardiac bone cement, and repair of the tricuspid valve and chordae.
OUTCOME: The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged from the 
hospital after 3 weeks. There were no intracardiac foreign bodies observed on 
chest CT after the operation.
LESSONS: For patients with cardiopulmonary discomfort after posterior 
decompression and bone cement-enhanced pedicle screw fixation, in view of the 
limitations of radiographic examination, we recommend performing chest CT 
examination to confirm the diagnosis. For patients with intravascular foreign 
body embolism, multidisciplinary team joint treatment saves lives.

Since the end of 2019, the whole world has been struggling with the pandemic of 
the new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Available 
evidence suggests that pain is a common symptom during Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19). According to the World Health Organization, many patients suffer 
from muscle pain (myalgia) and/or joint pain (arthralgia), sore throat and 
headache. The exact mechanisms of headache and myalgia during viral infection 
are still unknown. Moreover, many patients with respiratory failure get admitted 
to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilatory support. Pain in ICU patients 
can be associated with viral disease itself (myalgia, arthralgia, peripheral 
neuropathies), may be caused by continuous pain and discomfort associated with 
ICU treatment, intermittent procedural pain and chronic pain present before 
admission to the ICU. Undertreatment of pain, especially when sedation and 
neuromuscular blocking agents are used, prone positioning during mechanical 
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may trigger delirium 
and cause peripheral neuropathies. This narrative review summarizes current 
knowledge regarding challenges associated with pain assessment and management in 
COVID-19 patients. A structured prospective evaluation should be undertaken to 
analyze the probability, severity, sources and adequate treatment of pain in 
patients with COVID-19 infection.

Childhood obesity is commonly associated with a pes planus foot type and altered 
lower limb joint function during walking. However, limited information has been 
reported on dynamic intersegment foot motion with the level of obesity in 
children. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between 
intersegment foot motion during gait and body fat in boys age 7-11 years. Fat 
mass was measured in fifty-five boys using air displacement plethysmography. 
Three-dimensional gait analysis was conducted on the right foot of each 
participant using the 3DFoot model to capture angular motion of the shank, 
calcaneus, midfoot and metatarsals. Two multivariate statistical techniques were 
employed; principle component analysis reduced the multidimensional nature of 
gait analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis accounted for potential 
confounding factors. Higher fat mass predicted greater plantarflexion of the 
calcaneus during the first half and end of stance phase and at the end of swing 
phase. Greater abduction of the calcaneus throughout stance and swing was 
predicted by greater fat mass. At the midfoot, higher fat mass predicted greater 
dorsiflexion and eversion throughout the gait cycle. The findings present novel 
information on the relationships between intersegment angular motion of the foot 
and body fat in young boys. The data indicates a more pronated foot type in boys 
with greater body fat. These findings have clinical implications for pes planus 
and a predisposition for pain and discomfort during weight bearing activities 
potentially reducing motivation in obese children to be physically active.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a disease of worldwide distribution with a prevalence 
of 1 to 3%. Nail psoriasis is estimated in 50% of patients with psoriasis, and 
in the presence of joint involvement, it can reach 80%.
OBJECTIVE: To study the nail changes - and their clinical implications - 
presented by patients with psoriasis vulgaris under surveillance in a university 
hospital from the south of Brazil.
METHODS: his cross-sectional study evaluated 65 adult patients from January 2012 
to March 2013. Cutaneous severity was assessed according to the Psoriasis Area 
and Severity Index (PASI). The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) was used to 
evaluate patient's nails. The diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis was established 
according to the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR).
RESULTS: The prevalence of NP was 46.1%. These patients had a median 
[interquartilic range (IQR)] NAPSI of 1 (0-15). A total of 63.3% of patients 
reported aesthetic discomfort or functional impairment related to their nails. 
Onycholysis was the most common feature (80%). When compared with patients 
without nail involvement, patients with NP had lower mean age at psoriasis onset 
[21 (18-41) vs. 43 (30-56) years, p=0,001]; longer disease duration [15.5 
(10-24) vs. 6 (2-12) years, p=0.001]; higher PASI [9.2 (5-17) vs. 3.7 (2-10), 
p=0.044], higher frequency of psoriatic arthritis (43.3 vs. 3.7, p = 0.002) and 
more often reported family history of psoriasis (40% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: Onycholysis was the most frequent finding and most patients feel 
uncomfortable with the psoriatic nail changes that they experience.

BACKGROUND: Autologous or allogenic platelet gel is a blood component that 
exploits the effects of the cytokines contained in platelet α granules to 
stimulate repair processes. The properties of platelet gel were first tested on 
chronic ulcers to accelerate healing and later in orthopaedic, dental, vascular 
and cardiothoracic surgery. In our centre, we have been using platelet gel for 5 
years, first for surgical patients with difficult wounds, then for orthopaedic 
patients undergoing osteosynthesis surgery and patients with ulcers not 
responding to traditional therapies. Subsequently we decided to extend the use 
of platelet gel also to amputations or traumatic loss of tissue of fingers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article we present the results obtained over 5 
years concerning 115 patients with finger amputations or wounds treated with 
platelet gel in our Service of Transfusion Medicine. Platelets were obtained fom 
allogeneic buffy coats (10 mL) and the gel was produced by adding thrombin to 
concentrated platelets. The decision to use homologous platelet gel was based on 
its limited cost, ease of preparation, almost unlimited availability, the fact 
that the number of platelets that can be collected is much higher than the 
therapeutic range and so able to replace the losses due to secondary medication, 
and last, but not least, it causes no discomfort to patients. The safety of the 
product was ensured by virology tests including molecular biology studies.
RESULTS: The recovery of soft tissue in all patients ranged from 80 to 100%; the 
median time for this recovery was 3 weeks (range, 10 days - 6 weeks). 
Approximately 60% of the patients complained of local hypoaesthesia for some 
weeks; 30% of the patients developed hyperaesthesia, which resolved completely 
within 6-8 weeks from starting treatment. Loss of bone tissue represented an 
obstacle to total tissue recovery, but the aesthetic results were satisfactory 
in nearly all cases.
CONCLUSION: All patients showed good compliance, both because of the low 
frequency of medications (at most, twice a week) and because of the painless 
platelet gel applications. The only negative aspect was abnormal nail growth in 
a case of distal partial amputation of a finger. In conclusion, we believe that 
platelet gel can be very useful in patients with traumatic or surgical loss of 
finger tissue, since it can resolve critical situations thus avoiding amputation 
of residual tissue and compromised joint function.

PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has become one of the most commonly 
performed vascular procedures, because of the beneficial outcome it has when 
compared with medical therapy alone and because of the anatomic accessibility of 
the artery. In cases of distal carotid occlusive disease, high cervical carotid 
bifurcation, and some reoperative cases, access to the distal internal carotid 
artery may limit surgical exposure and increase the incidence of cranial nerve 
palsies. Mandibular subluxation (MS) is recommended to provide additional space 
in a critically small operative field. We report our experience to determine and 
illustrate a preferred method of MS.
METHODS: Techniques for MS were selected based on the presence or absence of 
adequate dental stability and periodontal disease. All patients received general 
anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation before subluxation. Illustrations are 
provided to emphasize technical considerations in performing MS in 10 patients 
(nine men and one woman) who required MS as an adjunct to CEA (less than 1% of 
primary CEAs). Patients were symptomatic (n = 7) or asymptomatic (n = 3) and had 
high-grade stenoses demonstrated by means of preoperative arteriography.
RESULTS: Subluxation was performed and stabilization was maintained by means of: 
Ivy loop/circumdental wiring of mandibular and maxillary bicuspids/cuspids (n = 
7); Steinmann pins with wiring (n = 1); mandibular/maxillary arch bar wiring (n 
= 1); and superior circumdental to circummandibular wires (n = 1). MS was not 
associated with mandibular dislocation in any patient. No postoperative cranial 
nerve palsies were observed. Three patients experienced transient 
temporomandibular joint discomfort, which improved spontaneously within 2 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Surgical exposure of the distal internal carotid artery is enhanced 
with MS and nasotracheal intubation. We recommend Ivy loop/circumdental wiring 
as the preferred method for MS. Alternative methods are used when poor dental 
health is observed.

BACKGROUND: The self-perceived health status of patients undergoing total hip 
and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) might differ post-operatively due to gender, 
age, or comorbidities. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) such as the 
EQ-5D-5L measure the self-perceived health status. This study investigates 
whether the index score of the EQ-5D-5L is a valid tool for interpreting gender 
differences in outcomes for patients undergoing THA and TKA.
METHODS: Routine and PROM-data of elective primary THA or TKA patients in two 
German hospitals between 2016 and 2018 were analyzed. Univariate analysis with 
Pearson's chi-square was conducted to identify control variables for gender. To 
quantify the association between gender and the EQ-5D-5L dimensions, a 
cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds was 
conducted.
RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred sixty-eight​​ THA patients (m = 978; 
f = 1390) and 1629 TKA patients (m = 715; f = 914) were considered. The 
regression analysis of the individual EQ-5D-5L dimensions showed that female 
gender was significantly associated with better self-care (THA and TKA) and 
better post-operative mobility (THA). In contrast, male gender was significantly 
associated with less pain/discomfort (TKA) and less anxiety/depression (THA) 
pre-surgery and 3-months post-surgery.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that the self-perceived health status improved 
after surgery. However, due to the different associations of gender to the 
individual dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L, the weighted index score clouds the 
comparability between patients with different gender undergoing THA or TKA. 
Therefore, we argue to use the individual five dimensions for health status 
analysis, to reveal relevant additional information.

Plain Language Summary: Patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA 
and TKA) can fill out standardized questionnaires pre- and post-surgery, such as 
the EQ-5D-5L, to measure the improvement in the self-perceived health status. 
The EQ-5D-5L includes mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. We do not know whether male and female patients experience 
the same improvement in the dimensions or whether significant differences exist. 
Currently, only index scores of the EQ-5D-5L are used for the comparison of pre- 
and post-operative health status. However, due to the questionnaire’s weighted 
composition, relevant changes in individual dimensions might be easily missed. 
Thus, we investigated whether significant differences between gender and the 
EQ-5D-5L dimensions in patients undergoing TKA and TKA are observable. We found 
that female patients reported significantly better scores in self-care (THA and 
TKA) and post-operative mobility (THA). In contrast, male gender was 
significantly associated with less pain/discomfort (TKA) and less 
anxiety/depression (THA) pre-surgery and 3-months post-surgery. The EQ-5D-5L’s 
weighted index score, however, does not directly represent these differences. 
Therefore, we argue to use the individual five dimensions for health status 
analysis, as relevant additional information on improvement over time would 
otherwise be missed.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical efficacy, characteristics and safety of 
endoscopic-assisted resection of single-segment posterior longitudinal ligament 
ossification in the treatment of thoracic spinal stenosis (TSS).
METHOD: Fifteen TSS patients, including 6 males and 9 females aged 43-70 years 
treated with endoscopic-assisted resection of single-segment posterior 
longitudinal ligament ossification through the transfacet joint approach by our 
team from November 2016 to June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The 
operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications were 
recorded. The VAS score, ODI and JOA score (full score, 11 points) were recorded 
before the operation, after the operation and at the last follow-up to evaluate 
the clinical efficacy and calculate the improvement rate.
RESULTS: The ventral side of the spinal cord was decompressed in all patients, 
providing improvements in neurological symptoms and significant pain relief. The 
mean follow-up time was 20.27 ± 3.87 months. Mean operation time, intraoperative 
blood loss, and hospitalization time were found to be 84.80 ± 13.23 min, 
36.33 ± 7.41 mL, 5.13 ± 1.02 days; respectively.The JOA score at the last 
follow-up was 8.6 ± 1.25, which was significantly better than the preoperative 
(5.53 ± 1.20) and postoperative (6.87 ± 1.31) scores (p < 0.05). The mean JOA 
score improvement rate was 56.5 ± 18.00%. The JOA score improvement rate 
classification at the last follow-up was excellent in 3 cases, good in 8 cases, 
effective in 3 cases, and no change in 1 case; for an effective rate of 93.33%. 
The VAS score significantly decreased from 6.67 ± 1.01 preoperatively to 
3.47 ± 0.88 postoperatively and 1.73 ± 0.67 at the last follow-up (p < 0.05). 
The ODI significantly decreased from 72.07 ± 6.08 preoperatively to 45.93 ± 5.01 
postoperatively and 12.53 ± 2.33 at the last follow-up (p < 0.05). Dural rupture 
occurred in 2 patients during the operation; 1 patient experienced neck 
discomfort during the operation, which was considered to be caused by high fluid 
pressure and was relieved by massage and by lowering the height of the 
irrigation fluid. No cases of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound infection or 
other complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic-assisted resection of posterior longitudinal ligament 
ossification through the facet joint approach is a safe and effective method for 
the treatment of TSS.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the functional outcome and 
causes of persistent disability in patients with isolated femoral shaft 
fractures treated at an academic level-1 trauma centre.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 40 consecutive skeletally mature patients 
with isolated, nonpathologic diaphyseal femur fractures. All patients underwent 
fracture reduction and fixation using an antegrade locked intramedullary nail. 
We measured functional outcome using the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and the Short Musculoskeletal 
Functional Assessment (SMFA). We obtained visual analog scores for pain in the 
groin, buttock, thigh and knee 6 months after the injury.
RESULTS: Joint-related and musculoskeletal outcome scores improved gradually 
from the baseline assessment to the 6-month review. Mean scores (and standard 
deviations [SDs]) on the WOMAC index improved gradually from 57 (23) to 24 (22) 
for pain, from 57 (25) to 30 (20) for stiffness and from 70 (21) to 21 (23) for 
function (p < 0.001). The mean SMFA score (and SD) improved from 64 (13) to 25 
(20) (p = 0.024). We noted no further improvements in functional outcome 
measures from the 6-month to the 12-month assessment (p > 0.21). Patients 
reported more pain in the knee than in other anatomic locations; the mean pain 
scores (and SDs) were 3.7 (3.1) in the knee, 2.5 (2.7) in the thigh, 1.7 (2.7) 
in the buttock and 1.0 (1.7) in the groin (p = 0.003). We noted correlations 
between knee pain and WOMAC pain (rho = 0.748, p < 0.001), function (rho = 
0.701, p < 0.001) and SMFA (rho = 0.733, p < 0.001). We noted weaker 
correlations between thigh, groin and buttock pain and functional outcomes, with 
rho scores ranging from 0.2 to 0.55.
CONCLUSION: Recovery from femur fractures occurs most rapidly in the first 6 
months after injury. Residual deficits in functional outcome were still 
measurable 12 months after injury. Knee pain was the most common and most severe 
source of patient discomfort 12 months after isolated femur fractures, and 
demonstrated moderate to good correlation with general and joint-specific 
functional outcome measures.

CONTEXTE: Cette étude avait pour but d'évaluer l'issue fonctionnelle et les 
causes de l'invalidité persistante chez les patients victimes d'une fracture 
isolée au niveau du corps du fémur dans un centre universitaire de traumatologie 
de niveau 1.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons inscrit de manière prospective 40 patients consécutifs dont 
le squelette était à maturité et qui avaient subi une fracture non pathologique 
isolée de la diaphyse du fémur. Tous les patients ont subi une 
réduction-fixation de leur fracture par enclouage antérograde intramédullaire 
verrouillé. Nous avons évalué les résultats fonctionnels à l'aide de l'indice 
WOMAC (pour Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis) et du 
questionnaire SMFA (pour Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment). Nous 
avons utilisé des échelles visuelles analogiques pour mesurer la douleur à 
l'aine, au siège, à la cuisse et au genou 6 mois après l'intervention.
RÉSULTATS: Sur les plans articulaire et musculosquelettique, les scores 
s'étaient graduellement améliorés au 6e mois, par rapport aux évaluations de 
départ. Les scores WOMAC moyens (écart-type [É.-T.]) se sont graduellement 
améliorés, passant de 57 (23) à 24 (22) pour la douleur, de 57 (25) à 30 (20) 
pour la raideur et de 70 (21) à 21 (23) pour le fonctionnement (p < 0,001). Le 
score SMFA moyen (et É.-T.) s'est amélioré, passant de 64 (13) à 25 (20) (p = 
0,024). Nous n'avons noté aucune autre amélioration quant aux résultats 
fonctionnels entre les évaluations du 6e et du 12e mois (p > 0,21). Les patients 
ont signalé des douleurs aux genoux plus qu'en tout autre point anatomique; les 
scores de douleur moyens (et É.-T.) étaient de 3,7 (3,1) pour le genou, de 2,5 
(2,7) pour la cuisse, de 1,7 (2,7) pour le siège et de 1,0 (1,7) pour l'aine (p 
= 0,003). Nous avons noté des corrélations entre la douleur au genou et le score 
de douleur WOMAC (ρ = 0,748, p < 0,001), le fonctionnement (ρ = 0,701, p < 
0,001) et le score SMFA (ρ = 0,733, p < 0,001). Nous avons noté des corrélations 
plus faibles entre la douleur à la cuisse, à l'aine et au siège et les résultats 
fonctionnels, avec des scores ρ allant de 0,2 à 0,55.
CONCLUSION: Le rétablissement après une fracture du fémur est plus rapide au 
cours des 6 premiers mois suivant le traumatisme. Des séquelles fonctionnelles 
mesurables persistent encore 12 mois après le traumatisme. La douleur au genou 
était la source la plus courante et la plus intense d'inconfort chez les 
patients 12 mois après la survenue d'une fracture du fémur isolée et s'est 
révélée en corrélation de modérée à bonne avec les résultats fonctionnels 
généraux et spécifiquement articulaires.

BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as 
chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the 
middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) 
through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear 
discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the 
micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be 
applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. 
Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of antibiotics versus antiseptics for 
people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane 
ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via 
the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of 
Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and 
unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at 
least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had 
chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had 
continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or 
combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) 
or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical 
antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an 
aural toileting procedure. Two comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: 
a) topical antibiotics or b) systemic antibiotics. Within each comparison we 
separated where both groups of patients had received topical antibiotic a) alone 
or with aural toilet and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic 
antibiotics).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard Cochrane methodological 
procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each 
outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' 
(whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to 
two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related 
quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or 
discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious 
complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven studies (935 participants) across four 
comparisons with antibiotics compared against acetic acid, aluminium acetate, 
boric acid and povidone-iodine. None of the included studies reported the 
outcomes of quality of life or serious complications. A. Topical antiseptic 
(acetic acid) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) It is 
very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge with 
acetic acid compared with aminoglycosides at one to two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 
0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.08; 1 study; 100 participants; very 
low-certainty evidence). No study reported results for ear discharge after four 
weeks. It was very uncertain if there was more ear pain, discomfort or local 
irritation with acetic acid or topical antibiotics due to the low numbers of 
participants reporting events (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.34; 2 RCTs; 189 
participants; very low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were 
reported narratively for hearing (quinolones) or suspected ototoxicity 
(aminoglycosides) (very low-certainty evidence). B. Topical antiseptic 
(aluminium acetate) versus topical antibiotics No results for the one study 
comparing topical antibiotics with aluminium acetate could be used in the 
review. C. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus topical antibiotics 
(quinolones) One study reported more participants with resolution of ear 
discharge when using topical antibiotics (quinolones) compared with boric acid 
ear drops at between one to two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.92; 1 study; 409 participants; moderate-certainty 
evidence). This means that one additional person will have resolution of ear 
discharge for every five people receiving topical antibiotics (compared with 
boric acid) at two weeks. No study reported results for ear discharge after four 
weeks. There was a bigger improvement in hearing in the topical antibiotic group 
compared to the topical antiseptic group (mean difference (MD) 2.79 decibels 
(dB), 95% CI 0.48 to 5.10; 1 study; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence) 
but this difference may not be clinically significant. There may be more ear 
pain, discomfort or irritation with boric acid compared with quinolones (RR 
0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 2 studies; 510 participants; low-certainty evidence). 
Suspected ototoxicity was not reported. D. Topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) 
versus topical antibiotics (quinolones) It is uncertain if there is a difference 
between quinolones and povidone-iodine with respect to resolution of ear 
discharge at one to two weeks (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 39 
participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported qualitatively 
that there were no differences between the groups for hearing and no patients 
developed ototoxic effects (very low-certainty evidence). No results for 
resolution of ear discharge beyond four weeks, or ear pain, discomfort or 
irritation, were reported. E. Topical antiseptic (acetic acid) + aural toileting 
versus topical + systemic antibiotics (quinolones) One study reported that 
participants receiving topical and oral antibiotics had less resolution of ear 
discharge compared with acetic acid ear drops and aural toileting (suction 
clearance every two days) at one month (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; 100 
participants). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge 
at between one to two weeks, ear pain, discomfort or irritation, hearing or 
suspected ototoxicity.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics (quinolones) 
probably results in an increase in resolution of ear discharge compared with 
boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of 
other topical antibiotics or topical antiseptics and so we are unable to draw 
conclusions. Adverse events were not well reported.

BACKGROUND: Nonunions of the tibia represent challenging orthopedic problems, 
which require the surgeon to analyze numerous factors and choose an appropriate 
treatment. This article presents a case report of tibia and fibula fracture 
patient who failed the internal fixation surgery and successfully recovered 
after one course of percutaneous autologous platelet lysates injection.
CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient received an internal nickelclad breakage at 
9 months post-surgery but reluctant to accept a second surgery, then autologous 
platelet lysates (APL) injection which is a less invasive method was 
recommended. The injections were carried once a week for three times. Radiologic 
evaluation was conducted every month until recovery.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
reported case of tibia delayed union with breakage of the plate resolved with 
APL injection. Improved clinical evidence was observed at 4 and 6 months after 
injection. The patient got good bony union at 8 months post-injection. The 
patient didn't feel any discomfort postinjection, no complications such as 
infection, refracture etc. were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: APL percutaneous injection could be a new therapeutic option for 
the treatment of nonunion or delayed healing fractures.

BACKGROUND: Extra-articular distal humerus locking plates (EADHPs) are 
precontoured anatomical plates widely used to repair distal humeral 
extra-articular diaphyseal fractures. However, EADHPs frequently cause distal 
protrusion and resulting skin discomfort. The purpose of this study was to 
predict the occurrence of anatomic fit mismatch. We hypothesized that the 
smaller the humerus size, the greater the anatomic fit mismatch with EADHP.
METHODS: Twenty humeri were analyzed in this study. Humeral length and distal 
humeral width were used as parameters of humeral size. Plate protrusion was 
measured between the EADHP distal tip and the distal humerus. We set the level 
of unacceptable EADHP anatomic fit mismatch as ≥10 mm plate protrusion.
RESULTS: A significant negative linear correlation was also confirmed between 
humeral size and plate protrusion, with a coefficient of determination of 0.477 
for humeral length and 0.814 for distal humeral width. The cutoff value of 
humeral length to avoid ≥10 mm plate protrusion was 293.6 mm (sensitivity, 
88.9%; specificity, 81.8%) and for distal humeral width was 60.5 mm 
(sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 81.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic fit mismatch in distal humeral fractures after EADHP 
fixation has a negative linear correlation with humeral length and distal 
humeral width. For patients with a distal humeral width <60.5 mm, ≥10 mm plate 
protrusion will occur when an EADHP is used, and an alternative implant or 
approach should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Radiation dose distributions created by two dimensional (2D) 
treatment planning are responsible for partial volumes receiving >107% of the 
prescribed dose in a proportion of patients prescribed whole breast radiotherapy 
after tumour excision of early breast cancer. These may contribute to clinically 
significant late radiation adverse effects.
AIM: To test three dimensional (3D) intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 
against 2D dosimetry using standard wedge compensators in terms of late adverse 
effects after whole breast radiotherapy.
METHODS: Three hundred and six women prescribed whole breast radiotherapy after 
tumour excision for early stage cancer were randomised to 3D IMRT (test arm) or 
2D radiotherapy delivered using standard wedge compensators (control arm). All 
patients were treated with 6 or 10MV photons to a dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions 
to 100% in 5 weeks followed by an electron boost to the tumour bed of 11.1Gy in 
5 fractions to 100%. The primary endpoint was change in breast appearance scored 
from serial photographs taken before radiotherapy and at 1, 2 and 5 years follow 
up. Secondary endpoints included patient self-assessments of breast discomfort, 
breast hardness, quality of life and physician assessments of breast induration. 
Analysis was by intention to treat.
RESULTS: 240 (79%) patients with 5-year photographs were available for analysis. 
Change in breast appearance was identified in 71/122 (58%) allocated standard 2D 
treatment compared to only 47/118 (40%) patients allocated 3D IMRT. The control 
arm patients were 1.7 times more likely to have a change in breast appearance 
than the IMRT arm patients after adjustment for year of photographic assessment 
(95% confidence interval 1.2-2.5, p=0.008). Significantly fewer patients in the 
3D IMRT group developed palpable induration assessed clinically in the centre of 
the breast, pectoral fold, infra-mammary fold and at the boost site. No 
significant differences between treatment groups were found in patient reported 
breast discomfort, breast hardness or quality of life.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that minimisation of unwanted radiation dose 
inhomogeneity in the breast reduces late adverse effects. Incidence of change in 
breast appearance was statistically significantly higher in patients in the 
standard 2D treatment arm compared with the IMRT arm. A beneficial effect on 
quality of life remains to be demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION: Since the 2012 Multinational Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic 
Arthritis (MAPP) survey, several systemic treatments for psoriasis (PsO) and/or 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have been approved. The population-based UPLIFT survey 
was conducted to understand how perceptions of treatment-related outcomes have 
evolved, particularly for patients with mild to moderate PsO and/or PsA and 
their dermatologists.
METHODS: This population- and web-based survey was conducted from 2 March to 3 
June 2020, in North America, Europe, and Japan. Adults with self-reported 
healthcare practitioner (HCP)-diagnosed PsO and/or PsA and dermatologists who 
spent > 50% of time treating patients and treated ≥ 20 patients with PsO, 
including plaque PsO, per month were included. Patient participants were 
recruited at random from online panels; dermatologists were recruited randomly 
from representative physician panels.
RESULTS: Of 264,054 patient responses, 3806 who self-reported an HCP diagnosis 
of PsO and/or PsA were included in the final sample; 67% had PsO alone, 28% had 
PsO and PsA, and 5% had PsA alone. The estimated population prevalence of 
psoriatic disease was 7% (PsO only: 4%; PsO and PsA: 2%; PsA only: 1%). Most 
patients (78%) reported PsO-involved body surface area (BSA) ≤ 3 palms, 
and ~ 90% or more reported itching, redness, flaking, and scales. Many PsO 
patients without diagnosed PsA reported musculoskeletal symptoms suggestive of 
PsA (63%). Across BSA categories, approximately one in four patients was not 
currently receiving treatment and > 50% had Dermatology Life Quality Index 
score > 5. Patients and dermatologists had different perceptions of PsO 
severity, office visit discussions, treatment goals, and treatment satisfaction. 
The survey was conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic, which could have affected assessments of patient-reported outcomes and 
ability to have in-person HCP visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PsO and PsA in UPLIFT reported high disease burden, 
including patients with limited skin involvement. An opportunity exists to align 
patient and dermatologist perceptions to optimize management of PsO and PsA.

Plain Language Summary: In recent years, several new treatments for psoriasis 
and psoriatic arthritis have become available. The UPLIFT survey was conducted 
to understand how viewpoints on psoriatic disease outcomes have changed, 
especially for patients whose disease is mild or moderate. UPLIFT was a large, 
online, population-based survey conducted in North America, Europe, and Japan. 
Adults with psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis and dermatologists who treated 
at least 20 patients with psoriasis per month were included. There were 3806 
patients who participated; of these, most had psoriasis and few had psoriatic 
arthritis. Most patients (78%) with mild to moderate psoriasis had a limited 
area of skin affected by psoriasis. Psoriasis symptoms were common and included 
itching, redness, flaking, and scales. Many patients without a diagnosis of 
psoriatic arthritis reported symptoms that could be related to this disease 
(such as joint discomfort). Although many patients had psoriasis symptoms, 
approximately one in four was not currently receiving treatment and more than 
half reported psoriasis impacted their quality of life. Patients and 
dermatologists had different perceptions of psoriasis severity, office visit 
discussions, treatment goals, and treatment satisfaction. There is an 
opportunity to improve treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to 
better align patient and physician perceptions of psoriasis. This survey was 
conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have partially affected some 
assessments and the ability to have in-person doctor visits.

BACKGROUND: Yunnan has the highest rates of HIV in China. Other treatable 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with accelerated HIV 
transmission and poor ART outcomes, but are only diagnosed by syndromic 
algorithms.
METHODS: We recruited 406 HIV-positive participants for a cross-sectional study 
(204 ART-naive and 202 receiving ART). Blood samples and first-voided urine 
samples were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction methods were used 
for diagnosing Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG) and 
Mycoplasma genitalium (MG). Syphilis and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) 
tests were also performed.
RESULTS: Among the 406 participants, the overall prevalence of STIs was 47.0% 
and 45.1% in ART-naive individuals and 49.0% in individuals receiving ART, 
respectively. The testing frequencies were 11.6% (11.8% vs. 11.4%), 33.2% (29.4% 
vs. 37.1%), 3.2% (3.4% vs. 3.0%), 2.0% (3.4% vs. 0.5%) and 4.7% (6.4% vs. 3.0%) 
for active syphilis, HSV-2, CT, NG and MG, respectively. The percentage of 
multiple infections in both groups was 10.8% (22/204) in ART-naive participants 
and 9.9% (20/202) in participants receiving ART. Female sex, an age between 18 
and 35 years, ever injecting drugs, homosexual or bisexual status, HIV/HBV 
coinfection, and not receiving ART were identified as risk factors. 
Self-reported asymptomatic patients were not eliminated from having a 
laboratory-diagnosed STI.
CONCLUSIONS: The STI prevalence was 47.0% (45.1% vs. 49.0%), and HSV-2, syphilis 
and MG were the most common STIs in HIV-infected individuals. We found a high 
prevalence (6.4%) of MG in ART-naive individuals. HIV-positive individuals tend 
to neglect or hide their genital tract discomfort; thus, we suggest 
strengthening STI joint screening and treatment services among HIV-infected 
individuals regardless of whether they describe genital tract discomfort.

BACKGROUND: Soft tissue defects or periprosthetic infections after total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) are severe complications that may lead to loss of the 
arthroplasty or the limb. Reconstructions with medial gastrocnemius flaps (MGF) 
are occasionally used to provide soft tissue coverage around the knee.
AIMS: The study aimed to establish the rate of implant survivorship after MGF 
reconstruction for soft tissue coverage in the treatment of exposed or infected 
TKA and to establish functional outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients who received 
soft tissue coverage with an MGF of an exposed or infected TKA between 2000 and 
2017 at the Department of Hand and Plastic Surgery at Umeå University Hospital. 
The outcomes were implant survivorship and patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) using the five-level EQ-5D version and The Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (mean age = 67 years, 30 women) were included. The 
mean time between flap coverage and follow-up was 6.7 (±3.4) years. Implant 
survivorship was observed in 28 of 47 (59.6%) patients at follow-up. Flap 
failure was rare, with only 3 of 47 (6.4%) cases. Of the 20 patients who 
answered the PROMs, 10 of 20 experienced moderate to severe pain or discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to unfavorable underlying conditions, MGF reconstruction after 
TKA is often associated with a compromised functional outcome. Because donor 
site morbidity is limited and flap failure is unusual, the procedure can be 
considered prophylactically in a small subset of patients with risk factors to 
prevent soft tissue defects and periprosthetic joint infection.

The purpose of this cohort study was to identify associations between combined 
oral and bone disease phenotypes and genes present in cell regulatory pathways. 
The studied pathways play important roles in cellular growth, proliferation, 
differentiation, and homeostasis. DNA samples extracted from whole saliva of 
3,912 individuals were genotyped and these data analyzed according to dental 
caries experience, periapical lesions, periodontitis, osteoporosis, or 
temporomandibular joint discomfort. Samples were obtained from the Dental 
Registry and DNA Repository project at the University of Pittsburgh. 
Twenty-seven polymorphisms in eight genes related to mTOR or endoplasmic 
reticulum stress pathways were selected for genotyping. Allele frequencies and 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were calculated. Analyses were performed comparing 
genotypes between affected and unaffected individuals for each phenotype, as 
well as for the associated phenotypes combined. For all analyses, we used the 
software PLINK with an alpha of 0.002. Borderline associations with multiple 
variants of several genes were found, suggesting that both pathways may be 
involved in the susceptibility to multiple conditions affecting the oral cavity 
and bones. When combining patients that had concomitant dental caries, 
periodontitis, and periapical pathology, several markers in RHEB showed 
statistically significant association. Multiple conditions affecting bone and 
teeth (i.e., dental caries, periodontitis, periapical lesion formation, and 
osteoporosis) appear to share similar underlying genetic etiological factors, 
which allow us to hypothesize that instead of individually, they should be 
studied in conjunction in human populations.

OBJECTIVE: Associations between pain and depression are well known, yet foot 
pain, common in populations, has been understudied. This cross-sectional study 
examined foot pain and severity of foot pain with depressive symptoms in adults.
METHODS: Framingham Foot Study (2002-2008) participants completed questionnaires 
that included questions about foot pain (yes/no; none, mild, moderate, or severe 
pain) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (scores ≥16 
indicated depressive symptoms). Age and body mass index (BMI) were also 
assessed. Sex-specific logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations of foot pain with 
depressive symptoms, adjusting for age and BMI. In a subset, further models 
adjusted for leg pain, back pain, or other joint pain.
RESULTS: Of 1,464 men and 1,857 women, the mean ± SD age was 66 ± 10 years. 
Depressive symptoms were reported in 21% of men and 27% of women. Compared to 
those with no foot pain and independent of age and BMI, both men and women with 
moderate foot pain had approximately a 2-fold increased odds of depressive 
symptoms (men with severe foot pain OR of 4 [95% CI 2.26-8.48], women with 
severe foot pain OR of 3 [95% CI 2.02-4.68]). Considering other pain regions 
attenuated ORs, but the pattern of results remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Even after we adjusted for age, BMI, and other regions of pain, 
those reporting worse foot pain were more likely to report depressive symptoms. 
These findings suggest that foot pain may be a part of a broader pain spectrum, 
with an impact beyond localized pain and discomfort.

The objective was to compare the immediate effects of local cryotherapy (LC) and 
passive cross-body stretch on the extensibility of the posterior shoulder muscle 
in individuals with posterior shoulder tightness. Eighty-seven healthy subjects 
with a between-shoulder difference in internal rotation (IR) range of motion 
(ROM) greater than 10° were randomly divided into three groups: LC group, 
stretching group, and control group (n = 29 in each group). Subjects in the LC 
group received LC on infraspinatus and posterior deltoid muscles and subjects in 
the stretching group performed passive cross-body stretch. Stretch sensation was 
measured at the end range of passive IR and horizontal adduction (HA) using 
numerical rating scale, and the pressure pain threshold (PPT) at the 
infraspinatus and posterior deltoid muscles was measured using pressure 
algometry. Passive and active ROM of IR and HA of the glenohumeral joint were 
measured using an inclinometer. All measurements were performed at 
pre-intervention, post- intervention, and 10-min follow-up. Stretch sensation 
was significantly decreased and PPT was significantly increased in the LC and 
stretching groups at post-intervention, and these effects were maintained at 
10-min follow-up, compared to the control group. Both the LC group and 
stretching group had a significantly greater increase in passive and active ROM 
of IR and HA, compared to the control group at post-intervention and 10-min 
follow-up. However, there were no significant differences in stretch sensation, 
PPT, or ROM of IR and HA between the LC group and stretching group. LC can be 
used to decrease the stretch sensation and increase PPT and ROM of IR and HA as 
much as a stretching exercise. LC could be an alternative method for increasing 
the restricted ROM of glenohumeral IR and HA for individuals with posterior 
shoulder tightness, especially for patients and sports players who have severe 
stretching discomfort. Key PointsLocal cryotherapy (LC) decreased the 
uncomfortable stretch sensation, and increased the pressure pain threshold (PPT) 
of infraspinatus and posterior deltoid muscles in subjects with posterior 
shoulder tightness.Decreased stretch sensation by LC without passive stretching 
could improve the passive and active ROM of internal rotation and horizontal 
adduction in subjects with posterior shoulder tightness, similar to cross-body 
stretch.LC can be an alternative method to increase extensibility when 
individuals with posterior shoulder tightness have high stretch sensitivity and 
low PPT in the infraspinatus and posterior deltoid muscles.

OBJECTIVES: Total hip arthroplasty is a reliable therapeutic intervention in 
patients with ankylosing spondylitis, in whom the aims of surgery are to reduce 
pain, restore hip function and improve quality of life. The current study is a 
retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiographic findings in a 
consecutive series of patients with hip ankylosis associated with severe 
ankylosing spondylitis who underwent bilateral primary total hip arthroplasty 
using non-cemented components.
METHODS: From June 2008 to May 2012, total hip arthroplasty was performed on 34 
hips in 17 patients with bilateral ankylosis caused by ankylosing spondylitis. 
The study patients included 13 men and 4 women with a mean age of 24.2 years. 
The mean duration of disease was 8.3 years and the average duration of hip 
involvement was 7.6 years. All patients had severe hip pain and dysfunction with 
bilateral bony ankylosis and no range of motion preoperatively and all underwent 
bilateral cementless total hip arthroplasty performed by a single surgeon. Joint 
pain, range of motion (ROM), and Harris hip scores were assessed to evaluate the 
postoperative results.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 31.7 months, all patients had experienced 
significant clinical improvement in function, ROM, posture and ambulation. At 
the final follow-up, the mean postoperative flexion ROM was 134.4° compared with 
0° preoperatively. Similar improvements were seen in hip abduction, adduction, 
internal rotation and external rotation. Postoperatively, 23 hips were 
completely pain-free, six had only occasional discomfort, three mild to moderate 
pain and two severe pain. The average Harris Hip Score improved from 23.7 
preoperatively to 65.8 postoperatively. No stems had loosened at the final 
follow-up in any patient, nor had any revision surgery been required.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral severe hip ankylosis in patients with ankylosing 
spondylitis can be treated with cementless bilateral synchronous total hip 
arthroplasty, which can greatly improve hip joint function and relieve pain 
without significant complications. Provided the overall physical condition of a 
patient and their economic situation make surgery a feasible option and the 
surgeon is experienced, this treatment is a worthwhile surgical intervention for 
bilateral hip bony ankylosis. However, the technically demanding nature of the 
procedure and potential pre- and post-operative problems should not be 
underestimated.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the individual and joint 
associations of sedentary behaviour, physical activity (PA), sleep and breakfast 
eating on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) amongst Chinese junior high 
school students.
METHODS: Data were from 783 junior high school students who participated in a 
health behaviour and health survey in Jining city of Shandong province of China. 
HRQoL was measured by the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, youth version 
(EQ-5D-Y). Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were applied to examine 
the associations between health behaviours and HRQoL.
RESULTS: Multivariable regression analyses showed that using a computer ≥ 2 h a 
day (vs. < 2 h/day) is associated with increased likelihood of having health 
problems in the three EQ-D-Y dimensions, including walking, looking after self 
and doing usual activities. Lower PA is associated with more problems in feeling 
worried, sad or unhappy, and with a lower visual analogue scale (VAS) score. 
Students who had insufficient sleep time (e.g., <7 h/day), and skipped eating 
breakfast were more likely to experience lower HRQoL in the dimensions of having 
pain or discomfort, and feeling worried, sad or unhappy, and a lower VAS score 
than those students who had longer sleep time and no breakfast skipping. 
Students who reported having the combined ≥ 2 unhealthy behaviours relative to 
the peers with 0-1 unhealthy behaviours were more likely to have lower HRQoL.
CONCLUSION: The findings in the present study underline the importance of 
promoting healthy behaviours in order to improve HRQoL amongst Chinese junior 
high school students.

Open lower limb fracture is life-changing, resulting in substantial morbidity 
and resource demand, while inconsistent outcome-reporting hampers systematic 
review and meta-analysis. A core outcome set establishes consensus among key 
stakeholders for the recommendation of a minimum set of outcomes. This study 
aims to define a core outcome set for adult open lower limb fracture. Candidate 
outcomes were identified from a previously published systematic review and a 
secondary thematic analysis of 25 patient interviews exploring the lived 
experience of recovery from open lower limb fracture. Outcomes were categorized 
and sequentially refined using healthcare professional and patient structured 
discussion groups. Consensus methods included a multi-stakeholder two-round 
online Delphi survey and a consensus meeting attended by a purposive sample of 
stakeholders, facilitated discussion, and voting using a nominal group 
technique. Thematic analysis and systematic review identified 121 unique 
outcomes, reduced to 68 outcomes following structured discussion groups. 
Outcomes were presented to 136 participants who completed a two-round online 
Delphi survey. The Delphi survey resulted in 11 outcomes identified as consensus 
'in' only. All outcomes were discussed at a consensus meeting attended by 15 
patients, 14 healthcare professionals, 11 researchers, and one patient-carer. 
Consensus was achieved for a four-core outcome set: 'Walking, gait and 
mobility', 'Being able to return to life roles', 'Pain or discomfort', and 
'Quality of life'. This study used robust consensus methods to establish a core 
outcome set that should be measured in all future research studies and audits of 
clinical practice without precluding the measurement of additional outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Recently, cryotherapy has become a common practice for postoperative 
pain management. The current accepted practice in Japan is the use of 
cryotherapy at 5 °C after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. However, this therapy 
has been reported to be highly intense because the sustained low temperature 
causes discomfort for patients. The optimum temperature and duration of cooling 
required for comfortable and effective cryotherapy after arthroscopic shoulder 
surgery were investigated.
METHODS: Because pain levels might differ depending on the condition, we 
selected 52 patients with rotator cuff injuries, which were the most common 
disorders indicated for arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Patients were treated 
with cryotherapy at 5 °C or 10 °C for 16 h or 24 h. The pain level was 
determined using the visual analogue scale, and deep shoulder joint temperatures 
were recorded at different time points for analysis.
RESULTS: Pain after arthroscopic shoulder surgery was found to be related to the 
presence of a brachial plexus block using the interscalene approach during 
surgical anesthesia. To obtain effective analgesia with cryotherapy, the cooling 
temperature and duration of cryotherapy had to be changed based on the presence 
or absence of the brachial plexus block. Patients who received brachial plexus 
blocks had the lowest recorded pain scores after receiving cryotherapy at 5 °C 
for 24 h after surgery. Patients who did not receive the block had the lowest 
recorded pain scores when receiving cryotherapy at either 5 °C for 16 h or 10 °C 
for 24 h.
CONCLUSIONS: Using universal cryotherapy intensity and duration settings 
regardless of the use of other interventions is likely to unintentionally 
increase postoperative pain levels. This study revealed that cryotherapy at 5 °C 
for 24 h was optimal for patients who received an anesthesia block and at 5 °C 
for 16 h or at 10 °C for 24 h for those who did not receive the anesthesia 
block. These results can be used as a reference for setting the temperature and 
duration of cryotherapy after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

The rapid manufacturing of vaccines has increased hesitancy toward receiving the 
COVID-19 vaccines. Clarifying what to expect after vaccination and revealing the 
possible side effects will lower hesitancy toward receiving the COVID-19 vaccine 
and increase public awareness. This descriptive cross-sectional survey-based 
study was conducted in Jordan (August 2021) to collect data on the short-term 
side effects following the COVID-19 vaccines. An extensive literature review was 
conducted by the research team to assist in developing the first draft of the 
survey. The survey was tested for face and content validity and piloted test to 
improve readability and clarity. The survey was organized into two sections 
(demographics and perceived COVID-19 vaccines' side effects). Data were analyzed 
using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). A total of 1,044 
participants were enrolled in the study. The most received vaccine among the 
participants was Pfizer-BioNTech (51.1%). The most frequently reported side 
effects were sore arm at the injection site (84.65%), fatigue (84.48%), 
discomfort (65.43%), muscles/joint pain (61.38%), drowsiness (58.73%), and 
headache (58.38%). More side effects were significantly associated with being 
older (p = 0.046), having an allergy (p = 0.024) or rheumatoid arthritis 
(p = 0.023), and participants who take NSAIDs regularly (p = 0.029). Short-term 
side effects of COVID-19 vaccines seem to be mostly local or transient in 
nature. Older age and certain comorbidities may increase susceptibility to side 
effects.

PURPOSE: With improved survival after chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL), it is imperative to maintain good quality of life as part of the 
management of post-therapy adverse effects. Avascular necrosis of the femoral 
head (AVNFH) is one such adverse effect. A need exists for a therapy that 
ameliorates discomfort, provides a productive life, is cost effective, and is 
joint preservative. We conducted the current study to evaluate the response to 
bisphosphonate in the nonsurgical management of AVNFH in adolescents and young 
adults (AYA) who receive treatment for ALL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 20 AYA patients-34 
affected hips-who received zolendronic acid 5 mg intravenously each year along 
with oral alendronate 70 mg weekly for 3 years. Clinical evaluation was 
performed by using the Visual Analog Scale and the Harris Hip Score. Radiographs 
were used to classify the Ficat-Arlet stage, monitor radiologic collapse, and 
evaluate the rate of progression.
RESULTS: Pain relief with a drop in the Visual Analog Scale score was observed 
at a mean duration of 5.2 weeks (range, 3 weeks to 11 weeks) after the start of 
therapy. Radiologic progression by one grade was observed in 12 hips (35.3%), 
and only one hip (2.94%) showed progression by two grades. At a mean follow-up 
of 50.3 months, 31 affected hips (91.1%) had a satisfactory clinical outcome and 
had not required any surgical intervention. The proportion of hips that required 
total hip arthroplasty were 0%, 5%, and 22.2% in Ficat-Arlet stage I, II, and 
III, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The combination of intravenous zolendronic acid and oral alendronate 
provides a pragmatic solution for the management of AVNFH after therapy for ALL 
in AYA patients. This therapy is safe, effective, and well tolerated.

Chronic face pain syndrome is a diagnostic and therapeutic problem for many 
specialists, and this proves the interdisciplinary and complex nature of this 
ailment. Physiotherapy is of particular importance in the treatment of pain 
syndrome in the course of temporomandibular joint functional disorders. In 
patients with long-term dysfunction of masticatory muscles, the palpation 
examination can localize trigger points, that is, thickening in the form of 
nodules in the size of rice grains or peas. Latent trigger points located in the 
muscles can interfere with muscular movement patterns, cause cramps, and reduce 
muscle strength. Because hidden trigger points can spontaneously activate, they 
should be found and released to prevent further escalation of the discomfort. 
Kinesiotaping (KT) is considered as an intervention that can be used to release 
latent myofascial trigger points. It is a method that involves applying specific 
tapes to the patient's skin in order to take advantage of the natural 
self-healing processes of the body. The aim of the study was to evaluate the 
effect of the kinesiotaping method and trigger points inactivation on the 
nonpharmacological elimination of pain in patients with temporomandibular 
disorders. The study was conducted in 60 patients (18 to 35 years old). The 
subjects were randomly divided into two subgroups of 30 people each. Group KT 
(15 women and 15 men) were subjected to active kinesiotaping application. Group 
TrP, composed of 16 women and 14 men, was subjected to physiotherapy with the 
release of trigger points by the ischemic compression method. The results show 
that the KT method and TrP inactivation brought significant therapeutic 
analgesic effects in the course of pain-related functional disorders of the 
muscles of mastication. The more beneficial outcomes of the therapy were 
observed after using the KT method, which increased the analgesic effect in 
dysfunctional patients.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic inherited disorder in which transition from 
infancy to adult care is particularly difficult and not sufficiently regulated. 
According to the scientific literature, only few medical centers offer 
healthcare assistance for adult patients with PKU that are therefore still 
treated in pediatric settings. This generates psychological, emotional, and 
organizational discomfort among patients, leading them to discontinue the 
follow-up. European guidelines and national consensus documents underline this 
unmet need and the lack of practical recommendations for a structured 
transitional pathway in PKU. The aim of this review and expert opinion is to 
propose good practices for managing the transition period of PKU patients, based 
on the literature and the experience of a panel of Italian experts in PKU. The 
consensus of the experts was obtained through the administration of three rounds 
of surveys and one structured interview. The result is the first proposal of a 
pathway for an efficient transition of PKU patients. Key steps of the proposed 
pathway are the "a priori" planning involving the pediatric and adult teams, the 
acceptance of the patient and his/her family to the process, the preliminary 
definition of appropriate spaces in the structure, the organization of meetings 
with the joint team, and the appointment of a transition coordinator. For the 
first time, the involvement of decision makers and patient associations is 
proposed.

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a salt-wasting tubulointerstitial disease of autosomal 
recessive inheritance (OMIM613395) caused by genic mutation of SLC12A3, which 
codes thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCCT) gene. The gene mutation of 
the majority of GS patients is compound heterozygous. This study analyzes two 
cases of GS gene mutation and the clinical phenotype. Twenty patients of two GS 
pedigrees underwent direct sequence alignment of 26 exons of SLC12A3 to spot and 
locate mutant site. Proband A of Pedigree I had three mutant sites: Arg928Cys, a 
homozygote, missense mutation, and two homozygous silent mutations, Ala122Ala 
and Thr465Thr, and 8 members of Pedigree I carried Arg928Cy heterozygous 
mutation. Proband B of Pedigree II had a homozygote, Ser710X, and a termination 
codon was spotted, which would inevitably be translated into abridged and 
defective protein, and 7 members had Ser710X heterozygous mutation. The 
heterozygous mutation carriers of the two pedigrees often have 
stimulus-controlled hypokalemia after strenuous exercise. The parents of Proband 
A are cousins, a case of intermarriage. Both probands show hypokalemia, 
hypochloraemia, hypocalcinuria, hyperreninemia, and hyperaldosteronemia; Proband 
A has normal serum magnesium and increased urinary sodium excretion, while 
Proband B has hypomagnesemia and increased urinary magnesium ion excretion. Both 
probands have normal or lower blood pressure, weakness and numbness of lower 
extremities, muscular soreness, and occasional palpitations and chest 
discomfort. Proband A wearies easily and Proband B has occasional joint numbness 
and pain. These two homozygous mutations are responsible for the morbidity of 
two GS families and they show heterogenicity of clinical phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Considering the fact that, due to recent evidence, many women no 
longer prefer hormone replacement therapy, it is especially important to develop 
intervention options to alleviate menopausal symptoms. Although there is 
conflicting evidence concerning effectiveness, there is an indication that 
physical activity and weight control may be useful for alleviating symptoms. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the effect of physical activity and body 
mass index on menopausal symptoms among menopausal women in Turkey.
METHODS: 305 women between the ages of 45 and 60 who visited the health center 
for various reasons were recruited into this cross-sectional study. Menopausal 
women, who visited one of five family physicians working in the same area, were 
included in the analyses. The Menopause Rating Scale, International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire and a generic medical and socio-demographic information 
questionnaire were used.
RESULTS: Women who were physically active had lower total menopausal 
(p < 0.001), somato-vegetative (p = 0.004), psychological (p = 0.002), and 
urogenital (p < 0.001) symptom scores than women who were less active. No 
differences in vasomotor symptoms were recorded related to physical activity 
level; significant differences were found for most menopausal symptoms, 
including sleep (p = 0.009) and sexual (p = 0.043) problems, joint and muscular 
discomfort (p < 0.001) and vaginal dryness (p = 0.016). BMI was not associated 
with total menopausal symptoms and with the subscales, excluding depressive mood 
(p = 0.009). A significant increasing trend in the rate of depressive mood was 
observed from normal through overweight to obese participants. The mean scores 
of the total menopausal symptoms were lower among the participants who were well 
educated, currently working and without chronic diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may play an important role in alleviating 
menopausal symptoms. As part of preventive medicine, primary care physicians 
should also stress lifestyle changes, including physical activity, to manage 
menopausal symptoms.

A dengue type 1 epidemic occurred in Fiji between July 1989 and July 1990. Virus 
isolation in C6/36 cell cultures and Toxorhynchites mosquitos yielded 36 
strains. Of the 3686 cases recorded by the Ministry of Health, 60% involved 
indigenous Fijians and 37%, Indians. A house-to-house survey revealed that a 
large majority of patients had classical dengue symptoms and 8% reported 
haemorrhagic manifestations. Among the children and adults hospitalized for 
dengue, 43% had haemorrhagic manifestations, including epistaxis, gingival 
bleeding, haematemesis, melaena and haematuria. A total of 15 patients with 
haemorrhagic manifestations and/or shock died, 10 of whom were aged 0-15 years; 
the diagnoses were confirmed in four cases by virus isolation or serology.

PIP: Researchers reviewed the medical records of all cases of dengue and 
dengue-like illness in Fiji since 1971. During March-April 1990, in Fiji, 
interviews were conducted with 426 occupants of 81 randomly selected houses in 
Suva and its surrounding areas to examine the relationship between the incidence 
of true dengue and dengue-like illnesses and the reported incidence. 60% of the 
persons interviewed were Fijians and 31% were Indians. Health workers collected 
blood samples from acute cases. 36 strains of dengue 1 virus was isolated. A 
fever lasting more than 3 days accompanied by at least one of the following 
symptoms denoted dengue or dengue-like illness: headache, joint pains, muscle 
pains, rash, epigastric discomfort, and bleeding. There was an outbreak of 
clinical dengue 1 during 1989-1990 involving 3686 cases. The 1975 outbreak 
involved 1600-2400 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. The 1989-1990 incidence 
was higher among Fijians than Indians (60% vs. 37%). The dengue epidemic peaked 
in November 1989 (about 900 cases). The rate of dengue hemorrhagic fever was 8% 
(15 cases). Hemorrhage manifestations included nosebleeds (8 persons), gingival 
bleeding (2), vomiting of blood (2), blood in the urine (3), and passage of dark 
stools stained with blood (3). The case fatality rate was 8%. Hemorrhages of the 
stomach and lungs occurred in most fatal cases. 10 of the 15 fatal cases were 
aged 10-15 years. 182 (43%) of the respondents in the household survey had 
reported dengue-like illness in the last 6 months. Children were more likely to 
have had dengue than adults (51% of 0-9 year olds and 61% of 10-19 year olds vs. 
32-33% for all other age groups). Among hospitalized dengue cases, 43% 
experienced hemorrhages.

Objective: To explore the prevalence and distinctive features of 
Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang (XFZYT) prescriptions by analyzing the National Health 
Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to identify the specific medical problems 
for which XFZYT is prescribed. Methods: This nationwide, population-based, 
cross-sectional study included 109,073 XFZYT users and 532,848 XFZYT non-users 
among Chinese herbal product (CHP) users in NHIRD. Chi-squared tests were used 
to analyze disparities between the XFZYT user and XFZYT non-user cohorts, and 
the mean age was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Logistic regression 
was used to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CIs). Results: XFZYT was frequently used to treat pain. The top five conditions 
for which the Taiwanese traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners would 
prescribe XFZYT were chest pain; headache; myalgia and myositis; lumbago; and 
neuralgia, neuritis, and radiculitis. Conclusion: This study represents an 
inaugural comprehensive survey conducted on the utilization of XFZYT 
prescriptions among patients with diverse diseases. XFZYT is mostly used to 
treat pain conditions in Taiwan. Combined with the combination use of other 
CHPs, XFZYT is used to treat symptoms of the chest and respiratory system, soft 
tissue conditions, menstruation disorders, and joint and back discomfort. These 
results suggest that further clinical trials are warranted to verify the effects 
of XFZYT in pain management.

This study evaluates how far T2 mapping can identify arthroscopically confirmed 
pathologies in the long biceps tendon (LBT) and quantify the T2 values in 
healthy and pathological tendon substance. This study comprised eighteen 
patients experiencing serious shoulder discomfort, all of whom underwent 
magnetic resonance imaging, including T2 mapping sequences, followed by shoulder 
joint arthroscopy. Regions of interest were meticulously positioned on their 
respective T2 maps, capturing the sulcal portion of the LBT and allowing for the 
quantification of the average T2 values. Subsequent analyses included the 
calculation of diagnostic cut-off values, sensitivities, and specificities for 
the detection of tendon pathologies, and the calculation of inter-reader 
correlation coefficients (ICCs) involving two independent radiologists. The 
average T2 value for healthy subjects was measured at 23.3 ± 4.6 ms, while 
patients with tendinopathy displayed a markedly higher value, at 47.9 ± 7.8 ms. 
Of note, the maximum T2 value identified in healthy tendons (29.6 ms) proved to 
be lower than the minimal value measured in pathological tendons (33.8 ms), 
resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval 
63.1-100) across all cut-off values ranging from 29.6 to 33.8 ms. The ICCs were 
found to range from 0.93 to 0.99. In conclusion, T2 mapping is able to assess 
and quantify healthy LBTs and can distinguish them from tendon pathology. T2 
mapping may provide information on the (ultra-)structural integrity of tendinous 
tissue, facilitating early diagnosis, prompt therapeutic intervention, and 
quantitative monitoring after conservative or surgical treatments of LBT.

Hydroxychloroquine, also known as quinine, is primarily utilized to manage 
various autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome. However, this drug has side effects, 
including diarrhea, blurred vision, headache, skin itching, poor appetite, and 
gastrointestinal discomfort. Blurred vision is caused by irreversible retinal 
damages and can only be mitigated by reducing hydroxychloroquine dosage or 
discontinuing the drug under a physician's supervision. In this study, color 
fundus images were utilized to identify differences in lesions caused by 
hydroxychloroquine. A total of 176 color fundus images were captured from a 
cohort of 91 participants, comprising 25 patients diagnosed with 
hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and 66 individuals without any retinopathy. The 
mean age of the participants was 75.67 ± 7.76. Following the selection of a 
specific region of interest within each image, hyperspectral conversion 
technology was employed to obtain the spectrum of the sampled image. Spectral 
analysis was then conducted to discern differences between normal and 
hydroxychloroquine-induced lesions that are imperceptible to the human eye on 
the color fundus images. We implemented a deep learning model to detect lesions, 
leveraging four artificial neural networks (ResNet50, Inception_v3, GoogLeNet, 
and EfficientNet). The overall accuracy of ResNet50 reached 93% for the original 
images (ORIs) and 96% for the hyperspectral images (HSIs). The overall accuracy 
of Inception_v3 was 87% for ORIs and 91% for HSI, and that of GoogLeNet was 88% 
for ORIs and 91% for HSIs. Finally, EfficientNet achieved an overall accuracy of 
94% for ORIs and 97% for HSIs.

Motion sickness is a common physiological discomfort phenomenon during car 
rides. In this paper, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) 
technique was used in real-world vehicle testing. The fNIRS technique was 
utilized to model the relationship between changes in blood oxygenation levels 
in the prefrontal cortex of passengers and motion sickness symptoms under 
different motion conditions. To enhance the accuracy of motion sickness 
classification, the study utilized principal component analysis (PCA) to extract 
the most significant features from the test data. Wavelet decomposition was used 
to extract the power spectrum entropy (PSE) features of five frequency bands 
highly related to motion sickness. The correlation between motion sickness and 
cerebral blood oxygen levels was modeled by a 6-point scale calibration for the 
subjective evaluation of the degree of passenger motion sickness. A support 
vector machine (SVM) was used to build a motion sickness classification model, 
achieving an accuracy of 87.3% with the 78 sets of data. However, individual 
analysis of the 13 subjects showed a varying range of accuracy from 50% to 100%, 
suggesting the presence of individual differences in the relationship between 
cerebral blood oxygen levels and motion sickness symptoms. Thus, the results 
demonstrated that the magnitude of motion sickness during the ride was closely 
related to the change in the PSE of the five frequency bands of cerebral 
prefrontal blood oxygen, but further studies are needed to investigate 
individual variability.

BACKGROUND: Phobia is an extreme form of anxiety or fear which is triggered by a 
given situation or object or even danger associated with a situation or object 
for more than 6 months. There are three main forms of phobia: social phobia 
(social anxiety disorder), specific phobia, or agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a 
form of anxiety disorder where one fears and avoids situations or places that 
might cause them to panic. The main purpose of this study is to investigate 
phobia among residents in broad training programs in Abha city and compare 
phobia between residents in broad training programs and general practitioners in 
Abha city.
METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study. The study was conducted in Abha city of 
Saudi Arabia from December 2019 to March 2020. It included a representative 
sample of medical doctors under broad training programs and general 
practitioners (none trained) in all the health-care centers. A link for the 
survey questionnaires was created and shared with the respondents. The 
questionnaire included sociodemographics of the participants, the Kutcher 
Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Psychometric Properties and 
Clinical Utility of the Specific Phobia Questionnaire in an Anxiety Disorders 
Sample for specific phobia.
RESULTS: The study included 300 physicians. Majority of them (81%) were in the 
age group between 25 and 30 years. Males represent 54% of them. There was no 
statistically significant difference between resident physicians and general 
practitioners regarding the avoidance of different social situations.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the residents in board training programs in Abha city 
expressed lower levels of discomfort, anxiety, distress, avoidance, fear, and 
life interference of some social and specific situations compared to general 
practitioners.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Understanding the patient experience is important for 
identifying the unmet need in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The current study 
aimed to develop a comprehensive chronic lymphocytic leukemia conceptual model.
METHODS: The conceptual model was based on literature searches, review of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient blogs/forums, and interviews with five 
expert clinicians, with 20 patients who received at most one treatment (first 
line) for their chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and with 20 patients with relapsed 
or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. De-identified interviews were 
transcribed, coded, and evaluated using qualitative data analysis software.
RESULTS: Thirty-five prevalent chronic lymphocytic leukemia-related symptom and 
impact concepts were identified from literature searches, patient blogs/forums, 
and clinician interviews. Patient interviews confirmed the identified concepts 
and revealed five additional concepts. Fatigue-related sub-components were 
identified from how patients described their fatigue, covering symptoms 
(tiredness/need for sleep, lack of energy, weakness, cognitive fatigue), and 
impacts (decreased ability to maintain their social, familial, or professional 
role, decreased physical functioning, frustration). Three versions of the 
conceptual model were created: an overall model with all concepts; a model 
highlighting the most prominent concepts in first line; and a model highlighting 
the most prominent concepts in relapsed or refractory disease. Prominent 
concepts in both first line and relapsed or refractory disease were 
fatigue-related symptoms and impacts, muscle/joint aches, night sweats, 
bruising, fever, recurrent infections/illness, insomnia, decreased 
cognitive/emotional functioning, anxiety/worry, stress, depression, financial 
difficulty, and fear of death. Dyspnea and cough were prominent in first line 
only, and enlarged lymph nodes, headaches, pain/discomfort, weight loss, 
nausea/vomiting, and infusion reactions were prominent in relapsed or refractory 
disease only.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that fatigue is a dominant issue affecting 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The three versions of the conceptual 
model can help researchers to understand patients' unmet needs and guide the 
patient-reported outcome strategy for clinical trials.

Background: Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases have affected 
members of religious communities. While major religions support vaccines, the 
views of individual clergy who practice and propagate major faith traditions are 
unclear. Our objective was to explore clergy attitudes toward vaccines and 
vaccine advocacy. Methods: In 2018-2019, we conducted qualitative interviews 
with clergy in Colorado and North Carolina. We inductively analyzed transcripts 
using a grounded theory approach, developing codes iteratively, resolving 
disagreements by consensus, and identifying themes. Results: We interviewed 16 
clergy (1 Buddhist, 3 Catholic, 2 Jewish, 1 Hindu, 1 Islamic, 7 Protestant, 
and 1 Unity). Analyses yielded seven themes: attitudes toward vaccines, 
congregational needs, public health climate, perceived responsibility, comfort 
and competing interests, reported advocacy efforts, and clergy health advocacy 
goals. Most clergy had positive vaccination attitudes and were open to vaccine 
advocacy, although discomfort with medical concepts and competing interests in 
their congregations influenced whether many had chosen to advocate for vaccines. 
Over half reported promoting vaccination in various contexts. Conclusions: In 
our sample, U.S. clergy held complex attitudes toward vaccines, informed by 
experience and social norms as much as religious beliefs or Scriptures. Clergy 
may be open to vaccine advocacy, but a perceived lack of relevance in their 
faith communities or a lack of medical expertise may limit their advocacy 
efforts in diverse contexts. Amidst growing vaccine hesitancy, pediatricians 
could partner with clergy in their communities, answer questions about vaccines, 
raise awareness of recent outbreaks, and empower clergy in joint educational 
events.

The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a 
scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of guar gum (E 412) as a food 
additive. In the EU, guar gum was evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert 
Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1970, 1974 and 1975, who allocated an 
acceptable daily intake (ADI) 'not specified'. Guar gum has been also evaluated 
by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1977 who endorsed the ADI 'not 
specified' allocated by JECFA. Following the conceptual framework for the risk 
assessment of certain food additives re-evaluated under Commission Regulation 
(EU) No 257/2010, the Panel considered that adequate exposure and toxicity data 
were available. Guar gum is practically undigested, not absorbed intact, but 
significantly fermented by enteric bacteria in humans. No adverse effects were 
reported in subchronic and carcinogenicity studies at the highest dose tested; 
no concern with respect to the genotoxicity. Oral intake of guar gum was well 
tolerated in adults. The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical 
ADI for guar gum (E 412), and there is no safety concern for the general 
population at the refined exposure assessment of guar gum (E 412) as a food 
additive. The Panel considered that for uses of guar gum in foods intended for 
infants and young children the occurrence of abdominal discomfort should be 
monitored and if this effect is observed doses should be identified as a basis 
for further risk assessment. The Panel considered that no adequate specific 
studies addressing the safety of use of guar gum (E 412) in food categories 
13.1.5.1 and 13.1.5.2 were available. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the 
available data do not allow an adequate assessment of the safety of guar gum 
(E 412) in infants and young children consuming these foods for special medical 
purposes.

In the United States, more women than men seek health-care services for symptoms 
of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A number of explanations are given for this 
gender difference including the higher rates of somatic non-gastrointestinal 
symptoms and increased psychological distress reported by women with IBS. 
However, these gender differences are found in studies that rely on 
retrospective recall with little attention to age or reproductive status. The 
purpose of the current analysis was to prospectively compare the frequency 
(days/month of moderate to severe based on a daily diary) of somatic, 
gastrointestinal (GI), and psychological distress symptoms, in menstruating 
women (N = 89) and postmenopausal women (N = 66) to men (N = 32) with IBS. In 
addition, the correlation between daily symptoms and daily report of overall 
health was evaluated. Postmenopausal women reported significantly more GI 
pain/discomfort symptoms, especially bloating and abdominal distension, than 
men, however these differences are greatly attenuated when age is controlled 
for. Both postmenopausal and menstruating women reported significantly more 
somatic symptoms (especially joint pain and muscle pain) than men with IBS. The 
effect was stronger in postmenopausal women, whose somatic symptoms were also 
higher than menstruating women (P = 0.014). Fatigue and stress were higher in 
women than men but anxiety and depression were not. All three types of symptoms 
were strongly correlated with self-rating of health, both across and 
within-person. Gender-related differences in GI and somatic symptoms are 
apparent in persons with IBS, more strongly in postmenopausal women. The 
presence of somatic symptoms in postmenopausal women with IBS may challenge 
clinicians to find suitable therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND: Work-related upper limb and neck musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) 
are one of the most common occupational disorders around the world. Although 
ergonomic design and training are likely to reduce the risk of workers 
developing work-related upper limb and neck MSDs, the evidence is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of workplace ergonomic design or training 
interventions, or both, for the prevention of work-related upper limb and neck 
MSDs in adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science (Science Citation 
Index), SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Occupational Safety and Health Review Group 
Database and Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register 
to July 2010, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database, US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health database, and International Occupational Safety and Health Information 
Centre database to November 2010.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ergonomic 
workplace interventions for preventing work-related upper limb and neck MSDs. We 
included only studies with a baseline prevalence of MSDs of the upper limb or 
neck, or both, of less than 25%.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data 
and assessed risk of bias. We included studies with relevant data that we judged 
to be sufficiently homogeneous regarding the intervention and outcome in the 
meta-analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each 
comparison using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs (2397 workers). Eleven studies were conducted 
in an office environment and two in a healthcare setting. We judged one study to 
have a low risk of bias. The 13 studies evaluated effectiveness of ergonomic 
equipment, supplementary breaks or reduced work hours, ergonomic training, a 
combination of ergonomic training and equipment, and patient lifting 
interventions for preventing work-related MSDs of the upper limb and neck in 
adults.Overall, there was moderate-quality evidence that arm support with 
alternative mouse reduced the incidence of neck/shoulder disorders (risk ratio 
(RR) 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.99) but not the incidence of 
right upper limb MSDs (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.66); and low-quality evidence 
that this intervention reduced neck/shoulder discomfort (standardised mean 
difference (SMD) -0.41; 95% CI -0.69 to -0.12) and right upper limb discomfort 
(SMD -0.34; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.06).There was also moderate-quality evidence that 
the incidence of neck/shoulder and right upper limb disorders were not reduced 
when comparing alternative mouse and conventional mouse (neck/shoulder RR 0.62; 
95% CI 0.19 to 2.00; right upper limb RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72), arm support 
and no arm support with conventional mouse (neck/shoulder RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.36 
to 1.24; right upper limb RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.29), and alternative mouse 
with arm support and conventional mouse with arm support (neck/shoulder RR 0.58; 
95% CI 0.30 to 1.12; right upper limb RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.36).There was 
low-quality evidence that using an alternative mouse with arm support compared 
to conventional mouse with arm support reduced neck/shoulder discomfort (SMD 
-0.39; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.10). There was low- to very low-quality evidence that 
other interventions were not effective in reducing work-related upper limb and 
neck MSDs in adults.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate-quality evidence to suggest that the use 
of arm support with alternative mouse may reduce the incidence of neck/shoulder 
MSDs, but not right upper limb MSDs. Moreover, we found moderate-quality 
evidence to suggest that the incidence of neck/shoulder and right upper limb 
MSDs is not reduced when comparing alternative and conventional mouse with and 
without arm support. However, given there were multiple comparisons made 
involving a number of interventions and outcomes, high-quality evidence is 
needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions clearly. While we 
found very-low- to low-quality evidence to suggest that other ergonomic 
interventions do not prevent work-related MSDs of the upper limb and neck, this 
was limited by the paucity and heterogeneity of available studies. This review 
highlights the need for high-quality RCTs examining the prevention of MSDs of 
the upper limb and neck.

Full skin auto-grafts are required for reconstruction of skin burns and trauma 
scars. However, currently available clinical approaches such as sheet skin 
graft, mesh skin grafts, artificial skin graft, and in vivo skin expansion have 
limitations due to their potential danger for secondary damage and scar 
formation at the donor site, and discomfort during skin expansion. We developed 
an advanced bioreactor system and evaluated its function in skin expansion using 
porcine full skin. The reactor was designed as a pneumatic cylinder type, was 
programmed to adjust the pressure and the operating time. The system was 
composed of culture chamber unit, environmental control unit, and monitoring 
unit. Skins were expanded at 200 kPa pneumatic force and the expanded skins were 
analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histology. Furthermore we carried out 
auto-grafting experiment of the expanded skins in vivo using Yucatan pigs and 
skins were harvested and histologically analyzed after 8 weeks. The results 
showed that the bioreactor expanded skins to 160% in 4 hours. Histological 
analysis of the expanded skins revealed that epidermal cells and dermal 
fibroblasts were viable and remained integrity. The results of auto-grafting 
experiment indicated that fibrosis and scars were not detected in the grafted 
skins. This study demonstrates that the newly developed skin bioreactor enabled 
to obtain large sized full skin rapidly and successful grating.

Giant aneurysm of the posterior circulation is associated with a higher risk of 
rupture compared with that of the anterior circulation. Furthermore, surgical 
clipping and interventional embolization for giant aneurysm of the posterior 
circulation are more difficult and complex to perform. The present study 
reported on the case of a 26-year-old female who exhibited a giant spherical 
aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar junction (VBJ) with a maximum diameter of ~35 mm 
that caused cervical discomfort. In addition, the patient experienced symptoms 
including left-sided walking and hoarseness caused by the compression of the 
brainstem and the posterior cranial nerves. The risks associated with performing 
surgery in this area are high and the prognosis is mainly poor. The patient of 
the present study was treated using the Pipeline Flex device with coil 
embolization. As a giant aneurysm of the VBJ simultaneously affects the 
bilateral vertebral arteries (VAs) and basilar artery, it is a unique condition 
and the treatment strategy must be personalized. Based on an analysis of the 
hemodynamic influence on the aneurysm in the present case, the Pipeline was 
placed through the left VA, the coils were packed through the right VA, and 
finally, the right VA was proximally occluded. At 7 months after embolization, 
the patient's modified Rankin scale score was 1 point. Upon analysis of the 
hemodynamic influence on the aneurysm of the VBJ, the VA with the larger shear 
force on the wall of the aneurysm was selected for occlusion to simplify the 
treatment of the aneurysm and to maximize the probability to achieve recovery.

PURPOSE: Although cancer clinical trials (CT) offer opportunities for novel 
treatments that may lead to improved outcomes, adolescents and young adults 
(AYA) are less likely to participate in these trials as compared to younger 
children and older adults. We aimed to identify the perceptions and attitudes 
toward CT in AYA that influence trial participation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of cancer literature was conducted 
that assessed perceptions and attitudes toward CT enrollment limited to AYA 
patients (defined as age 15-39). We estimated the frequency of identified themes 
by pooling identified studies.
RESULTS: In total, six original research articles were identified that 
specifically addressed perceptions or attitudes that influenced CT participation 
in AYA patients. Three studies were conducted at pediatric centers - one at an 
AYA unit, one at an adult cancer hospital, and one was registry based. Major 
themes identified for CT acceptability included: hope for positive clinical 
affect, altruism, and having autonomy. Potential deterrents included: prolonged 
hospitalization, worry of side effects, and discomfort with experimentation.
CONCLUSION: Limited information is available with regard to the perceptions and 
attitudes toward CT acceptability among AYA patients, especially those treated 
at adult cancer centers, which prevents generalization of data and themes. 
Future research assessing strategies for understanding and supporting CT 
decision-making processes among AYA represents a key focus for future funding to 
improve CT enrollment.

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is 
controversial. Limited studies have demonstrated the satisfactory outcomes of 
percutaneous adhesiolysis in FBSS, which can be performed as a 1 day or 3 days 
procedure. In the current randomized clinical trial, we compared the clinical 
and functional outcomes of these 2 techniques.
METHODS: In this study, 60 patients with FBSS were randomly assigned into 2 
equal groups: 1 day group and 3 days group. Before and at 4 and 12 weeks after 
the procedure, pain intensity was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS). 
The Oswestry disability index (ODI) was also completed. Pain reduction of 50% or 
more was defined as treatment success.
RESULTS: Significant pain relief and ODI improvement were obtained in the 2 
groups with adhesiolysis (P < 0.001). However, pain intensity remained the same 
before and at 4 and 12 weeks after adhesiolysis. ODI score was significantly 
lower in 1 day group in the 1 month visit (P < 0.001). Treatment was successful 
in 76.7% and 83.3% of the patients in 1 day and 3 days groups, respectively (P = 
0.519).
CONCLUSIONS: Adhesiolysis is an effective treatment for pain relief and 
functional improvement in FBSS. The results of 1 day and 3 days procedures are 
comparable. Based on these findings, the authors recommend using 1 day 
technique, which can potentially decrease the patients' discomfort, hospital 
stay, and cost of treatment.

We report 17 patients (20 hips) in whom metal-on-metal resurfacing had been 
performed and who presented with various symptoms and a soft-tissue mass which 
we termed a pseudotumour. Each patient underwent plain radiography and in some, 
CT, MRI and ultrasonography were also performed. In addition, histological 
examination of available samples was undertaken. All the patients were women and 
their presentation was variable. The most common symptom was discomfort in the 
region of the hip. Other symptoms included spontaneous dislocation, nerve palsy, 
a noticeable mass or a rash. The common histological features were extensive 
necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration. To date, 13 of the 20 hips have required 
revision to a conventional hip replacement. Two are awaiting revision. We 
estimate that approximately 1% of patients who have a metal-on-metal resurfacing 
develop a pseudotumour within five years. The cause is unknown and is probably 
multifactorial. There may be a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal 
wear debris or a hypersensitivity reaction to a normal amount of metal debris. 
We are concerned that with time the incidence of these pseudotumours may 
increase. Further investigation is required to define their cause.

BACKGROUND: Subspine impingement is considered a source of residual hip symptoms 
after primary hip arthroscopy, and the role of the subspine space and soft 
tissue is not clear. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship 
between the subspine space and labrum size in subspine impingement patients.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with femoroacetabular 
impingement between July 2016 and July 2020. Sixteen patients without hip 
symptom relief after primary hip arthroscopic treatment of femoroacetabular 
impingement and undergoing revision surgery for anterior inferior iliac spine 
compression were included as the study group. Forty-eight matched patients who 
underwent only primary surgery and whose hip discomfort was relieved without a 
diagnosis of subspine impingement were included as the control group. The 
patients' preoperative computerized tomography data were reviewed, and the 
anterior inferior iliac spine dimensions and the size of the subspine space were 
measured. The size of the labrum at the 11:30, 1:30, and 3 o'clock positions was 
measured with the use of magnetic resonance imaging. The ratio of the subspine 
space to the labrum was also calculated.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in anterior inferior iliac spine 
dimensions between these two groups (p > 0.05). A relatively narrow subspine 
space was found in the study group, especially in the direction of the anterior 
inferior iliac spine. Compared with the control group, subspine impingement 
patients were identified with larger labrums at 11:30 (8.20 ± 1.95 mm vs. 
6.81 ± 0.50 mm, p = 0.016), 1:30 (7.83 ± 1.61 mm and 6.25 ± 0.78 mm, p = 0.001) 
and 3:00 (9.50 ± 1.73 mm vs. 7.48 ± 0.99 mm, p = 0.001). A relative mismatch 
between the subspine space and the labrum was also identified in the study 
group. The ratios of the labrum width to the subspine area were significantly 
larger in the study group than in the control group.
CONCLUSION: This study reported potential additional criteria for subspine 
impingement-a large labrum and a relatively narrow subspine space-instead of 
abnormal anterior inferior iliac spine dimensions. For those with a large labrum 
and narrow subspine space, the diagnosis of subspine impingement should be 
carefully made, and arthroscopic anterior inferior iliac spine decompression may 
be important.

AIMS: The aim of this study is to develop a core set of outcome domains that 
should be considered and reported in all future trials of childhood limb 
fractures.
METHODS: A four-phase study was conducted to agree a set of core outcome 
domains. Identification of candidate outcome domains were identified through 
systematic review of trials, and outcome domains relevant to families were 
identified through semi-structured interviews with 20 families (parent-child 
pairing or group). Outcome domains were prioritized using an international 
three-round Delphi survey with 205 panellists and then condensed into a core 
outcome set through a consensus workshop with 30 stakeholders.
RESULTS: The systematic review and interviews identified 85 outcome domains as 
relevant to professionals or families. The Delphi survey prioritized 30 upper 
and 29 lower limb outcome domains at first round, an additional 17 upper and 18 
lower limb outcomes at second round, and four additional outcomes for upper and 
lower limb at the third round as important domains. At the consensus workshop, 
the core outcome domains were agreed as: 1) pain and discomfort; 2) return to 
physical and recreational activities; 3) emotional and psychosocial wellbeing; 
4) complications from the injury and treatment; 5) rturn to baseline activities 
daily living; 6) participation in learning; 7) appearance and deformity; and 8) 
time to union. In addition, 9a) recovery of mobility and 9b) recovery of manual 
dexterity was recommended as a core outcome for lower and upper limb fractures, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This set of core outcome domains is recommended as a minimum set of 
outcomes to be reported in all trials. It is not an exhaustive set and further 
work is required to identify what outcome tools should be used to measure each 
of these outcomes. Adoption of this outcome set will improve the consistency of 
research for these children that can be combined for more meaningful 
meta-analyses and policy development. Cite this article: Bone Joint

BACKGROUND: Angular deformities of the lower extremities are among the most 
common findings in pediatric orthopedics. Alteration of the mechanical axis in 
the lower extremity affects the cosmetic appearance and may lead to gait 
disturbances, knee discomfort, patellar maltracking with or without pain, and 
early joint osteoarthritis. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the 
efficacy of 3-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plates in tension-band temporary 
hemiepiphysiodesis for correcting idiopathic knee coronal angular deformities.
METHODS: The surgical procedure was performed using an extraperiosteal tension 
band plate (a 3-hole reconstruction plate) and two 3.5 mm cortical screws to 
treat idiopathic knee coronal angular deformity in children. The location of the 
hemiepiphysiodesis was determined based on the type of angular deformity 
present. Postoperative follow-ups were conducted through x-rays to measure the 
medial proximal tibial angle and lateral distal femoral angle of the limbs. 
Statistical analysis was then performed to evaluate the efficacy of the surgical 
treatment based on the rate of alignment change exhibited.
RESULTS: The study included 14 patients (25 limbs) with genu valgum deformity 
who underwent temporary hemiepiphysiodesis on both the distal femur and proximal 
tibia, with 16 proximal tibias and 15 distal femurs being corrected. The 
correction rate for genu valgum was found to be 0.59° per month for both 
proximal tibial and distal femoral hemiepiphysiodesis. Six patients (12 limbs) 
were also identified with genu varum deformity, and the correction rates for 
proximal tibial lateral hemiepiphysiodesis and distal femoral lateral 
hemiepiphysiodesis were 0.85° and 0.15° per month, respectively. During a mean 
follow-up duration of 11 ± 5.7 months, only one case of physeal plate closure 
was observed, and there were no other significant complications.
CONCLUSION: Temporary hemiepiphysiodesis with a 3-hole R-plate and two cortical 
screws takes advantage of physiological physeal growth to successfully treat 
idiopathic angular deformities with low complication rates.

BACKGROUND: Endocrine therapy-related symptoms are associated with early 
discontinuation and quality of life among breast cancer survivors. Although 
previous studies have examined these symptoms and clinical covariates, little is 
known about the interactions among different symptoms and correlates. This study 
aimed to explore the complex relationship of endocrine therapy-related symptoms 
and to identify the core symptoms among breast cancer patients.
METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis conducted based on a multicenter 
cross-sectional study of 613 breast cancer patients in China. All participants 
completed the 19-item Chinese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES). Multivariate linear regression analysis 
was performed to identify significant factors. A contemporaneous network with 15 
frequently occurring symptoms was constructed after controlling for age, 
payment, use of aromatase inhibitors, and history of surgery. Network comparison 
tests were used to assess differences in network structure across demographic 
and treatment characteristics.
RESULTS: All 613 participants were female, with an average age of 49 years (SD = 
9.4). The average duration of endocrine therapy was 3.6 years (SD = 2.3) and the 
average symptom score was 18.99 (SD = 11.43). Irritability (n = 512, 83.52%) and 
mood swings (n = 498, 81.24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Lost interest in 
sex (mean = 1.95, SD = 1.39) and joint pain (mean = 1.57, SD = 1.18) were the 
most severe symptoms. The edges in the clusters of emotional symptoms 
("irritability-mood swings"), vasomotor symptoms ("hot flashes-cold sweats-night 
sweats"), vaginal symptoms ("vaginal discharge-vaginal itching"), sexual 
symptoms ("pain or discomfort with intercourse-lost interest in sex-vaginal 
dryness"), and neurological symptoms ("headaches-dizziness") were the thickest 
in the network. There were no significant differences in network structure (P = 
0.088), and global strength (P = 0.330) across treatment types (selective 
estrogen receptor modulators vs. aromatase inhibitors). Based on an evaluation 
of the centrality indices, irritability and mood swings appeared to be 
structurally important nodes after adjusting for the clinical covariates and 
after performing subgroup comparisons.
CONCLUSION: Endocrine therapy-related symptoms are frequently reported issues 
among breast cancer patients. Our findings demonstrated that developing targeted 
interventions focused on emotional symptoms may relieve the overall symptom 
burden for breast cancer patients during endocrine therapy.

BACKGROUND: Human dirofilariosis is still a little known infection even in 
endemic areas. Dirofilariosis is zoonotic infection usually abortive in humans; 
instead, we report a very rare case (the 4th in the world), the first in Italy, 
in which at least two infective larvae became mature adults that mated and 
produced active microfilariae even though they did not reach peripheral blood.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old Italian woman presented with a transient 
oedematous swelling on the left abdominal wall with a creeping eruption followed 
by the occurrence of a subcutaneous nodular painless mass in the iliac region. 
One month later, a similar temporary swelling appeared on the contralateral 
inguinal region associated with intermittent joint discomfort in both knees. The 
patient had recently travelled abroad, therefore many possible diagnoses were to 
be ruled out. Routine laboratory investigations revealed eosinophilia. An 
ultrasound examination of the iliac swelling evidenced a well-defined cyst with 
a big filamentous formation in continuous movement. A fine-needle aspiration of 
the lesion was performed for parasitological, cytological and histological 
exams. The prompt microscopic examination of the aspired material showed the 
presence of numerous microfilariae that were initially morphologically 
attributed to Mansonella ozzardi. Subsequently, the revision of the Giemsa 
stained film and molecular analyses of the biological material, allowed to 
identify Dirofilaria repens as etiological agent of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: We report of a case in whom microfilariae were detected in 
fine-needle aspirate of subcutaneous node, without evidence of microfilaraemia, 
and the infection failed to become fully patent. Therefore we confirm that 
complete development and fertilization of D. repens worms in human hosts may 
occur, at variance with what is commonly believed, that Dirofilaria worms cannot 
fully develop in humans.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS), which collected data from an Internet polling panel, and to 
compare PROMIS with national norms.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We compared demographics and self-rated health of the 
PROMIS general Internet sample (N=11,796) and one of its subsamples (n=2,196) 
selected to approximate the joint distribution of demographics from the 2000 
U.S. Census, with three national surveys and U.S. Census data. The comparisons 
were conducted using equivalence testing with weights created for PROMIS by 
raking.
RESULTS: The weighted PROMIS population and subsample had similar demographics 
compared with the 2000 U.S. Census, except that the subsample had a higher 
percentage of people with higher education than high school. Equivalence testing 
shows similarity between PROMIS general population and national norms with 
regard to body mass index, EQ-5D health index (EuroQol group defined descriptive 
system of health-related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions 
including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression), and self-rating of general health.
CONCLUSION: Self-rated health of the PROMIS general population is similar to 
that of existing samples from the general U.S. population. The weighted PROMIS 
general population is more comparable to national norms than the unweighted 
population with regard to subject characteristics. The findings suggest that the 
representativeness of the Internet data is comparable to those from 
probability-based general population samples.

Prostacyclin (PGI2) possesses various physiological functions, including 
modulation of nociception, inflammation and cardiovascular activity. Elucidation 
of these functions has been hampered by the absence of selective IP receptor 
antagonists. Two structurally distinct series of IP receptor antagonists have 
been developed: 
4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-[4-(4-isopropoxy-benzyl)-phenyl]-amine (RO1138452) 
and 
R-3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-[5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-benzofuran-2-ylmethoxycarbonylamino]-propionic 
acid (RO3244794).RO1138452 and RO3244794 display high affinity for IP receptors. 
In human platelets, the receptor affinities (pKi) were 9.3 +/- 0.1 and 7.7 +/- 
0.03, respectively; in a recombinant IP receptor system, pKi values were 8.7 +/- 
0.06 and 6.9 +/- 0.1, respectively. Functional antagonism of RO1138452 and 
RO3244794 was studied by measuring inhibition of carbaprostacyclin-induced cAMP 
accumulation in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the human IP receptor. The 
antagonist affinities (pKi) of RO1138452 and RO3244794 were 9.0 +/- 0.06 and 8.5 
+/- 0.11, respectively. Selectivity profiles for RO1138452 and RO3244794 were 
determined via a panel of receptor binding and enzyme assays. RO1138452 
displayed affinity at I2 (8.3) and PAF (7.9) receptors, while RO3244794 was 
highly selective for the IP receptor: pKi values for EP1 (< 5), EP3 (5.38), EP4 
(5.74) and TP (5.09). RO1138452 (1-10 mg kg(-1), i.v.) and RO3244794 (1-30 mg 
kg(-1), i.v.) significantly reduced acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions. 
RO1138452 (3-100 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and RO3244794 (0.3-30 mg kg(-1), p.o.) 
significantly reduced carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and edema 
formation. RO3244794 (1 and 10 mg kg(-1), p.o.) also significantly reduced 
chronic joint discomfort induced by monoiodoacetate. These data suggest that 
RO1138452 and RO3244794 are potent and selective antagonists for both human and 
rat IP receptors and that they possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory 
potential.

BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Complete and consecutive observation of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract continues to present challenges for current 
endoscopy systems. We developed a novel upper and mid gastrointestinal (UMGI) 
capsule endoscopy using the modified detachable string magnetically controlled 
capsule endoscopy (DS-MCE) and inspection method and aimed to assess the 
clinical application.
METHODS: Patients were recruited to undergo UMGI capsule endoscopy followed by 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy. All capsule procedures in the upper gastrointestinal 
(UGI) tract were conducted under the control of magnet and string. The main 
outcome was technical success, and the secondary outcomes included visualization 
of the UMGI tract, examination time, diagnostic yield, compliance, and safety 
evaluation.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled and all UMGI capsule procedures realized 
repeated observation of the esophagus and duodenum with detection rates of 
100.0%, 80.0%, and 86.7% of Z-line, duodenal papilla, and reverse side of 
pylorus, respectively. String detachment was succeeded in 29 patients (96.7%) 
and the complete examination rate of UMGI tract was 95.45% (21/22). All UMGI 
capsule procedures were well tolerated with low discomfort score, and had a good 
diagnostic yield with per-lesion sensitivity of 96.2% in UGI diseases. No 
adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This new capsule endoscopy system provides an alternative screening 
modality for the UMGI tract, and might be indicated in cases of suspected upper 
and small bowel GI bleeding. Trial registration DS-MCE-UGI and SB, NCT04329468.

PURPOSE: To highlight the potential shortcomings associated with the current use 
Rasch analysis for validation of ophthalmic questionnaires, and to present an 
alternative application of Rasch analysis to derive insights specific to the 
cohort of patients under investigation.
METHODS: An alternative application of Rasch analysis was used to investigate 
the quality of vision (QoV) for a cohort of 481 patients. Patients received 
multifocal intraocular lenses and completed a QoV questionnaire one and twelve 
months post-operatively. The rating scale variant of the polytomous Rasch model 
was utilized. The parameters of the model were estimated using the joint maximum 
likelihood estimation. Analysis was performed on data at both post-operative 
assessments, and the outcomes were compared.
RESULTS: The distribution of the location of symptoms altered between 
assessments with the most annoyed patients completely differing. One month 
post-operatively, the most prevalent symptom was starbursts compared to glare at 
twelve months. The visual discomfort from the most annoyed patients is 
substantially higher at twelve months. The current most advocated approach for 
validating questionnaires using Rasch analysis found that the questionnaire was 
"Rasch-valid" one month post-operatively and "Rasch-invalid" twelve months 
post-operatively.
CONCLUSION: The proposed alternative application of Rasch analysis to 
questionnaires can be used as an effective decision support tool at population 
and individual level. At population level, this new approach enables one to 
investigate the prevalence of symptoms across different cohorts of patients. At 
individual level, the new approach enables one to identify patients with poor 
QoV over time. This study highlights some of the potential shortcomings 
associated with the current use of Rasch analysis to validate questionnaires.

BACKGROUND: For treating displaced patella fractures, tension band wiring is the 
most widely used technique. However, implant removal surgery is often necessary 
to alleviate discomfort caused by fixation materials. On the contrary, fixation 
using nonabsorbable suture materials is anticipated to result in comparable 
outcomes without need for further implant removal surgery. However, there is a 
lack of clinical studies comparing the two fixation techniques (wire and 
nonabsorbable suture materials) for acute patella fractures.
METHODS: From 2014 to 2018, we retrospectively reviewed 60 patients who 
underwent open reduction with internal fixation for acute patella fracture. 
Thirty patients (group 1) who received surgery using tension band wiring and 30 
patients (group 2) who received surgery using nonabsorbable suture materials 
were enrolled. The average follow-up period was more than 1 year after 
operation. Operation time, postoperative bone union time, range of motion (ROM) 
of the knee joint, postoperative clinical results, and complications were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULT: Operation time, clinical bone union, and radiologic bone union were not 
statistically different between groups 1 and 2. At 3 months postoperatively, 
flexion was 120.3 ± 9.4° in group 1 and 110.5 ± 7.7° in group 2, showing 
statistically significant difference (p = 0.037). At 6 and 12 months 
postoperatively, the ROM was similar in both groups. Hospital for special 
surgery score at 3 months postoperatively was 78.4 ± 8.2 in group 1 and 
83.7 ± 8.7 in group 2, showing statistically significant differences 
(p = 0.032). However, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, there were no 
statistical differences. Lysholm score at 3 months postoperatively was 
73.5 ± 8.1 in group 1 and 80.4 ± 8.2 in group 2, showing statistically 
significant difference (p = 0.016), but at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, 
there were no statistical differences.
CONCLUSION: Fixation using multiple nonabsorbable suture materials can be an 
alternative surgical method in managing patella fractures, along with tension 
band wiring.

INTRODUCTION: Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) indicates an 
individual's perception of how their well-being and quality of life is 
influenced by oral health. It facilitates treatment planning, assessing patient 
centred treatment outcomes and satisfaction.
AIM: The study aimed to identify the factors influencing OHRQoL among Tamil 
speaking South Indian adult population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-probability sampling was done and 199 subjects aged 
20-70 years were recruited for this observational study. The subjects were 
requested to fill a survey form along with the validated Tamil General Oral 
Health Assessment Index (GOHAI-Tml) questionnaire in the waiting area following 
which clinical examination was done by a single experienced Periodontist.
RESULTS: The mean score with standard deviation for physical dimension was 
4.34±0.96, psychological dimension was 4.03±1.13 and pain was 4.05±1.09 on 
GOHAI. Greater impacts were seen for psychosocial dimensions like pleased with 
the appearance of teeth/denture Q7 (3.7±1.2), worried about the problems with 
teeth/denture Q9 (3.7±1) and pain or discomfort in teeth Q12 (3.8±1). Functions 
like swallowing Q3 (4.5±0.8) and speaking Q4 (4.6±0.7) were minimally affected. 
As age increased subjects perceived more negative impacts as indicated by lower 
ADD-GOHAI and higher SC-GOHAI scores (p<0.01). Subjects complaining of bad 
breath, bleeding gums and Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) problems, reported poor 
OHRQoL (p<0.05). It was observed that as self-perceived oral and general health 
status deteriorated, OHRQoL also worsened (p<0.01). Subjects with missing teeth, 
cervical abrasion, restorations, gingival recession and mobility had more 
impacts on OHRQoL (p<0.05). Subjects diagnosed with periodontitis had lower 
OHRQoL as reported on the scale than gingivitis subjects (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: In this study minimal impact was seen in all the three dimensions 
assessed with GOHAI. Factors like age, education, employment status, income, 
self-reported oral health, self-perceived general health, satisfaction with oral 
health, perceived need for treatment and denture wearing status influenced 
perceived OHRQoL. Bad breath, bleeding gums, TMJ problems, more number of 
missing teeth, decayed teeth, cervical abrasion, gingival recession and mobility 
were associated with poor OHRQoL.

OBJECTIVE: Communication about patients' values, goals, and prognosis in serious 
illness (serious illness communication) is a cornerstone of person-centered care 
yet difficult to implement in practice. As part of Serious Illness Care Program 
implementation in five health systems, we studied the clinical culture-related 
factors that supported or impeded improvement in serious illness conversations.
METHODS: Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews of clinical leaders, 
implementation teams, and frontline champions.
RESULTS: We completed 30 interviews across palliative care, oncology, primary 
care, and hospital medicine. Participants identified four culture-related 
domains that influenced serious illness communication improvement: (1) clinical 
paradigms; (2) interprofessional empowerment; (3) perceived conversation impact; 
(4) practice norms. Changes in clinicians' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in 
these domains supported values and goals conversations, including: shifting 
paradigms about serious illness communication from 'end-of-life planning' to 
'knowing and honoring what matters most to patients;' improvements in 
psychological safety that empowered advanced practice clinicians, nurses and 
social workers to take expanded roles; experiencing benefits of earlier values 
and goals conversations; shifting from avoidant norms to integration norms in 
which earlier serious illness discussions became part of routine processes. 
Culture-related inhibitors included: beliefs that conversations are about dying 
or withdrawing care; attitudes that serious illness communication is the 
physician's job; discomfort managing emotions; lack of reliable processes.
CONCLUSIONS: Aspects of clinical culture, such as paradigms about serious 
illness communication and inter-professional empowerment, are linked to 
successful adoption of serious illness communication. Further research is 
warranted to identify effective strategies to enhance clinical culture and drive 
clinician practice change.

BACKGROUND: Previous research support the claim that people who work in offices 
and sit for a long time are particularly prone to musculoskeletal disorders.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this paper is to introduce an exercise training 
program designed to decrease muscle stiffness and pain that can be performed in 
the office setting.
METHODS: Forty healthy office workers (age: 28±5.3 years old; body mass: 
87.2±10.2 kg; height: 1.79±0.15 m) apart from suffering from any sub-clinical 
symptoms of muscle and joint stiffness, and who had at least two years of 
experience in office work were chosen and randomly assigned to either an 
experimental group (n = 20) or a control group (n = 20). The experimental group 
performed the exercise training program three times a week for 11 weeks. The 
Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to measure the pain 
levels in the neck, shoulders, and lower back areas. The Borg CR-10 Scale was 
used to measure their perceived exertion when doing the exercises, and a 
goniometer was used to measure the changes in range of motion (ROM) of the neck, 
hips, knees, and shoulders.
RESULTS: The overall results indicated that the exercise program could 
significantly (p < 0.05) reduce the neck, shoulders, and lower back pains of the 
participants in the exercise group while those in the control group showed no 
improvement in those pains. There were significant (p < 0.05) increases in the 
ROM of the hips, the neck, both knees and shoulders in the exercise group. 
Participants showed significant (p = 0.011) decreases in perceived exertion 
scores after the exercises.
CONCLUSIONS: The exercise training program designed in this study not only can 
effectively reduce neck, shoulders, and lower back pains, but also can improve 
the ROM or flexibility of the office workers.

Report of a Joint Nordic Project with DACEHTA Denmark (closed in 2012), FinOHTA 
Finland, NOKC Norway, and SBU, Sweden. ConclusionsCardiovascular complications, 
diabetes mellitus and death: Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome covaries with 
cardiovascular disease, including stroke and early death in men (moderately 
strong scientific evidence). There is insufficient evidence for women. There is 
insufficient scientific evidence of a relationship between obstructive sleep 
apnoea syndrome and arterial hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Traffic 
accidents: Obstructive sleep apnoea covaries with traffic accidents independent 
of daytime sleepiness and driving exposure among men (limited scientific 
evidence). Diagnostic procedures: The apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) shows good 
agreement between two nights of polysomnographic recordings (moderately strong 
scientific evidence). Manually scored portable devices including airflow, 
respiratory movements and pulse oximetry during one night of sleep have high 
sensitivity and specificity to identify a pathologic apnoea-hypopnoea index 
compared with polysomnography (strong scientific evidence). Automatic scoring of 
the results of portable devices has high sensitivity and identifies most 
patients with a pathologic apnoea-hypopnoea index, but specificity is low 
(strong scientific evidence). Automatic scoring programs cannot score sleep time 
and it is unclear whether these programs can differentiate obstructive from 
central apnoeas. Pulse oximetry with results from the oxygen desaturation index 
is insufficient to identify a pathologic apnoea-hypopnoea index and there is a 
high risk that patients with sleep apnoea syndrome will be incorrectly 
classified as normal (strong scientific evidence). A global impression from a 
case history and a physical examination alone are insufficient to identify or to 
rule out obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (strong scientific evidence). 
TreatmentsContinuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP): There is strong 
evidence that CPAP reduces daytime sleepiness regardless of the severity of the 
sleep apnoea syndrome (strong scientific evidence). CPAP is highly effective in 
reducing obstructive sleep apnoeas (strong scientific evidence). There is 
contradictory scientific evidence concerning the effect of CPAP on quality of 
life (measured as functional outcomes and vitality) or arterial blood pressure. 
Tolerance and compliance with CPAP is good, and about 70% of patients still use 
it after 1–4 years for a mean of 5.3 (range 4.4–6.2) hours per night (moderately 
strong scientific evidence) – provided that patients and their CPAP equipment 
are seen by physicians shortly after treatment starts and subsequently at 
individual intervals, but always at least once a year. Mild to moderate 
discomfort from the CPAP mask – pain at the bridge of the nose, skin problems, 
air leaks and disturbing noise from the CPAP machine – are common adverse 
effects of CPAP (moderately strong scientific evidence). Mild nasal adverse 
effects, such as rhinitis, are common (limited scientific evidence). Auto-CPAP 
utilises a lower mean pressure than fixed CPAP, but the effects on daytime 
sleepiness, apnoea reduction and compliance are the same (strong scientific 
evidence). Mandibular repositioning appliances (MRAs): Custom-made mandibular 
repositioning appliances reduce daytime sleepiness in patients with mild to 
moderate sleep apnoea syndrome (limited scientific evidence). They reduce apnoea 
frequency but to a lesser extent than CPAP (limited scientific evidence). There 
is insufficient evidence concerning the effect of MRAs on quality of life 
(measured as functional outcomes and vitality) or arterial blood pressure. MRAs 
are still used by 76% of patients after one year and 56% after five years 
(limited scientific evidence). A majority of patients experience mild adverse 
effects – including discomfort in the teeth, hypersalivation and minor 
reductions in overjet and overbite – during the first few months (limited 
scientific evidence). Surgery: There is insufficient scientific evidence for the 
effect of any surgical modality on daytime sleepiness or quality of life. There 
is contradictory scientific evidence for the effect of laser-assisted 
uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) in reducing apnoea frequency. There is insufficient 
scientific evidence for other surgical interventions in reducing apnoea 
frequency. The adverse effects of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) due to 
snoring or obstructive sleep apnoea include serious perioperative and 
postoperative complications, including death, bleeding and respiratory 
compromise (moderately strong scientific evidence). Persistent adverse effects 
are frequent, and difficulty in swallowing occurs in about 28% of patients 
(moderately strong scientific evidence). Voice changes are also common (limited 
scientific evidence). The adverse effects of uvulopalatoplasty (UPP) and 
laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) due to snoring or obstructive sleep 
apnoea include serious postoperative complications (limited scientific 
evidence). Persistent adverse effects occur in 50–60% of patients and difficulty 
swallowing in about 26% (moderately strong scientific evidence). Globus 
sensation in the throat and voice changes are common (limited scientific 
evidence). Other treatments and lifestyle modifications: No studies that meet 
the present inclusion criteria show that weight reduction programmes, bariatric 
surgery, drugs, pacemakers, devices for sleep in lateral position, 
didgeridoo-playing or any other suggested treatment or lifestyle modification 
for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome have any effect.

BACKGROUND: Seroma formation is a common complication after mastectomy and is 
associated with delayed wound healing, infection, skin flap necrosis, patient 
discomfort and repeated visits to the out patient clinic to deal with seroma and 
its sequelae. Closing the dead space after mastectomy seems to be key in 
reducing seroma and its complications. Various methods have been described to 
reduce the dead space after mastectomy: closed suction drainage, quilting of the 
skin flaps and application of adhesive tissue glues. The aim of this trial is to 
compare seroma formation and its sequelae in the various methods of flap 
fixation.
METHODS: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 
female breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy, with or without axillary 
clearance. Exclusion criteria consist of breast conserving therapy, direct 
breast reconstruction and incapacity to comprehend implications and extent of 
study and unable to sign for informed consent. A total of 336 patients will be 
randomized. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of three treatment arms 
consisting of flap fixation using ARTISS tissue glue with a low suction drain, 
flap fixation using sutures and a low suction drain or conventional wound 
closure (without flap fixation) and low suction drainage. Follow up will be 
conducted up to twelve months post surgery. The primary outcome is the number of 
seroma aspirations and secondary outcomes consist of number of out patient 
clinic visits, surgical skin infection rate, shoulder function, cosmesis, 
health-related quality of life and costs and cost-effectiveness (cost/QALY).
DISCUSSION: This is the first study of its kind to evaluate the effect of flap 
fixation and its sequelae (ie seroma aspirations, number of out patient clinic 
visits, infection, shoulder function, patient assessed cosmesis, quality of life 
and cost-effectiveness) in a double blind randomized controlled trial.

Sibiraea laexigata (L.) Maxim (SLM) has been used as an herbal tea for treating 
stomach discomfort and indigestion for a long time in china. Polysaccharides 
have been identified as one of the major bioactive compounds in the SLM. In the 
present paper, ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE) method was 
employed in polysaccharides extraction derived from SLM using polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) as extraction solvent, two SLM polysaccharides (SLMPs) fractions 
(SLMPs-1-1 and SLMPs-2-1) were purified by DEAE Cellulose-52 and Sephadex G-100 
chromatography in sequence. Then, the preliminarily structure of the two 
factions were characterized by chemical composition analysis, molecular weight 
measurement, UVS, HPLC-PMP, FT-IR, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra 
analysis and SEM. The results showed that SLMPs-1-1 and SLMPs-2-1 with different 
molecular weights of 1.03 and 1.02 kDa, mainly composed of glucose (46.76 and 
46.79%), respectively. The results of structural characterization from FT-IR, 1H 
NMR, and SEM revealed that SLMPs-1-1 and SLMPs-2-1 contained the typical 
pyranoid polysaccharide with α-glycosidic bond and β-glycosidic bond. 
Furthermore, it was found that SLMPs-1-1 could increase the levels of tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), and alleviated the immune 
organs tissue damage of cyclophosphamide (Cy)-treated mice. RT-qPCR and 
Western-Blot analysis showed that SLMPs-1-1 could significantly up-regulated the 
levels of NF-κB, TLR4, which revealed that SLMPs-1-1 could participate in 
immunosuppressive protection of Cy-treated mice. These findings suggested that 
the potential of SLMPs-1-1 as an alternative immunostimulator could be used in 
food and pharmaceutical industries.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most common complaint among industrial 
workers. The potato-chip processing industry involves workers in repetitive 
activities leading to MSDs. This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to 
assess MSDs health risk among potato-chip processing workers. It was conducted 
among 107 randomly sampled workers from a distribution like other groups exposed 
to similar ergonomics factors. A MSDs health-risk assessment produced a matrix 
of combined results based on a self-report questionnaire (5 levels) and an 
ergonomics risk assessment using RULA (4 levels). The self-reported MSDs 
questionnaire showed that workers had moderate to very high discomfort levels, 
i.e., 11.21% trunk, 9.35% lower limbs, 8.41% upper limbs and 4.66% for the neck. 
Ergonomic risks were found to be at a very high level, 77.57%, and high risk 
level, 19.63%. The combined matrix assessments showed that most workers were at 
moderate to very high MSDs risk, i.e., 43.92% trunk, 36.45% upper limbs, 32.71% 
lower limbs and 20.56% for the neck. This health risk matrix found a higher 
proportion of workers presenting with MSDs health risk compared with the 
musculoskeletal disorders self-assessment alone. Therefore, the MSDs risk matrix 
assessment could be useful for surveillance screening prior to implementing a 
risk-reduction program. Further, using ergonomics training programs and 
improving work stations for high-risk groups are also recommended based on the 
ergonomic and health risk assessments in this study.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common chronic musculoskeletal 
disorder that seriously affects quality of life. The percutaneous endoscopic 
lumbar diskectomy (PELD) technique was developed to address spinal nerve root 
compression through direct visualization of pathological findings while 
minimizing tissue destruction upon exposure. It is an effective and safe 
treatment for LDH. However, recurrent LDH is a major concern after lumbar 
discectomy for primary LDH. A considerable number of clinical studies have 
reported that patients with LDH with radiculopathy could benefit from manual 
therapy. Shi's manual therapy (SMT) was established based on traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) theory and has been shown to have a superior effect in 
alleviating muscle tension and loosening joints to improve lumbar and leg pain, 
radiculopathy, stiffness, activity discomfort, and related disorders. However, 
there is a lack of high-quality clinical evidence to support this conclusion. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of Shi's manual therapy (SMT) and PELD for LDH with radiculopathy.
METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 1-year 
follow-up period will be performed. A total of 510 participants with LDH with 
radiculopathy will be recruited from four clinical centers. The sample size was 
estimated, and statistical analysis will be performed and supervised by 
biostatisticians from an independent third-party research institution. Two 
hundred fifty-five subjects will be randomly allocated to each group. The 
subjects in the control group will undergo PELD. Participants in the 
intervention group will be treated with a combination of SMT and PELD. 
Recurrence rate is the primary endpoint and the survival analysis of recurrence 
rate is the secondary endpoint, and the primary analysis of recurrence rate is 
the chi-square test and the secondary analysis of recurrence rate is survival 
analysis. The primary outcome measure is the recurrence rate of LDH with 
radiculopathy at the 1-year follow-up after treatment. The secondary outcome 
measures will be the ODI score, the VAS score for pain for the lumbar spine and 
lower limbs, the straight leg raise angle, the stability of the operated lumbar 
segment, and the SF-36 scores. Assessments will occur at baseline, 
postoperation, and 1 week, 4 weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 1 year 
postoperation. In addition, adverse events related to clinical symptoms and 
signs and the results of laboratory tests will be documented during the clinical 
trials.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide reliable evidence of the effectiveness and 
safety of the combination of SMT and PELD for LDH with radiculopathy. If the 
results are favorable, it is expected that patients with LDH with radiculopathy 
will benefit from this study, and many patients could gain a good alternative 
treatment for LDH with radiculopathy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with greater tuberosity fractures of the humerus often 
require surgery. Therefore, there is a need to find a minimally invasive and 
effective surgical procedure with great patient outcomes.
AIM: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of the W-shaped suture technique under 
shoulder arthroscopy in the treatment of greater tuberosity fractures of the 
humerus.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 17 patients were included. The 
fractures were closed, and there was no neurovascular injury. These patients 
underwent arthroscopically assisted reduction and internal fixation of the 
greater tuberosity fractures. Fixation was performed using sighting nails 
combined with a W-shaped suture. The imaging data of the patients were 
collected, and the ASES score, Constant-Murley score, and VAS score were used to 
evaluate the patient's outcome. At the last follow-up (at least 1 year), the 
range of motion in the affected shoulder was compared with that of the 
contralateral side.
RESULTS: The operation was successful in all the patients. The average follow-up 
time was 13 months. There were no reported complications such as fracture 
displacement, nonunion, and internal fixation failure during the follow-up 
period. Post-operative X-ray examinations revealed good function recovery, with 
a healing time of between 10 and 12 weeks, and an average healing time of 
11.5 weeks. Following the operation, patients reported reduced shoulder joint 
pain that no longer influenced their activity or caused discomfort in their 
daily life. The patient's VAS score ranged from 0 to 3, with an average of 0.52 
± 0.73, while at the last follow-up, the Constant-Murley score ranged from 83 to 
97, with an average of 92.33 ± 7.55. The ASES score ranged from 81 to 98, with 
an average of 93.15 ± 6.93. At the last follow-up, there was no significant 
difference in the overall range of motion with the unaffected limb.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the W-shaped suture can be used to 
effectively fix the fractures of the greater tuberosity of the humerus, by 
increasing the fixed area to promote healing.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated radiographic and functional results of volar locking 
plate fixation of unstable distal radius fractures.
METHODS: The study included 27 patients (15 males, 12 females; mean age 45 
years; range 18 to 77 years) who were treated with volar locking plate fixation 
for unstable distal radius fractures. Twenty-two patients (81.5%) had AO type C 
and five (18.5%) had type B fractures. Two patients (7.4%) had type I open 
fractures. Dorsal and volar angulation were present in 21 (77.8%) and six 
(22.2%) fractures, respectively. Four patients (14.8%) also had elbow 
dislocation and/or fracture and nine patients (33.3%) had disruption of the 
distal radioulnar joint. Autologous iliac crest graft was used in 10 patients 
(37%). Postoperative assessments included range of movement and grip strength 
measurements, and radiographic parameters using the Stewart criteria. Functional 
results were assessed using the Q-DASH (Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder 
and Hand) questionnaire and the Gartland-Werley scale. The mean follow-up was 18 
months (range 12 to 34 months).
RESULTS: All fractures united without a problem within a mean of 6.5 weeks 
(range 6 to 8 weeks). The following parameters became equal to the unaffected 
side: ulnar variance (n=21, 77.8%), radial inclination angle (n=13, 48.2%), 
radial tilt angle (n=8, 29.6%), and radial height (n=11, 40.7%). The mean 
radiographic Stewart score was 0.5 (range 0 to 3). The mean grip strength of the 
operated side was 72.4% (18 kg) of the normal side. The mean Q-DASH and 
Gartland-Werley scores were 8.3 (range 0 to 70.5) and 4.7 (range 0 to 16), 
respectively. According to the Gartland-Werley scale, the results were excellent 
in 12 patients (44.4%), good in 12 patients, and moderate in three patients 
(11.1%). Three complications (11.1%) occurred, including loss of alignment in 
two patients, and screw-related discomfort in one patient.
CONCLUSION: Volar locking plate fixation is an effective treatment in the 
anatomical and functional restoration of unstable distal radius fractures.

BACKGROUND: Fracture of the distal radius is a common injury. A surgical 
treatment is external fixation, where metal pins inserted into bone on either 
side of the fracture are then fixed to an external frame.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing 
different methods of external fixation for distal radial fractures in adults.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register (June 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, conference proceedings and 
reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials 
which compared different methods of external fixation in adults with a distal 
radial fracture.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All review authors independently performed study 
selection. Two authors independently assessed the included trials and performed 
data extraction.
MAIN RESULTS: Nine small trials involving 510 adults with potentially or 
evidently unstable fractures, were grouped into five comparisons. The 
interventional, clinical and methodological heterogeneity of trials precluded 
data pooling. Only one trial had secure allocation concealment. Two trials 
comparing a bridging (of the wrist) external fixator versus pins and plaster 
external fixation found no significant differences in function or deformity. One 
trial found tendencies for more serious complications but less subsequent 
discomfort and deformity in the fixator group. Three trials compared 
non-bridging versus bridging fixation. Of the two trials testing uni-planar 
non-bridging fixation, one found no significant differences in functional or 
clinical outcomes; the other found non-bridging fixation significantly improved 
grip strength, wrist flexion and anatomical outcome. The third trial found no 
significant findings in favour of multi-planar non-bridging fixation of complex 
intra-articular fractures. One trial using a bridging external fixator found 
that deploying an extra external fixator pin to fix the 'floating' distal 
fragment gave superior functional and anatomical results. One trial found no 
evidence of differences in clinical outcomes for hydroxyapatite coated pins 
compared with standard uncoated pins. Two trials compared dynamic versus static 
external fixation. One trial found no significant effects from early dynamism of 
an external fixator. The poor quality of the other trial undermines its findings 
of poorer functional and anatomical outcomes for dynamic fixation.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient robust evidence to determine the 
relative effects of different methods of external fixation. Adequately powered 
studies could provide better evidence.

Gastrointestinal effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed for the 
treatment of many conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, 
gouty arthritis, the joint and muscle discomfort associated with systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and other musculoskeletal disorders. Yet, their benefits, which 
are believed to be a result of their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2), are accompanied by considerable toxicity. NSAIDs' untoward effects are 
attributed to their inhibition of the constitutively expressed enzyme 
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), with attendant suppression of the synthesis of 
prostanoids, substances that mediate key homeostatic functions. Side effects 
include suppression of hemostasis through inhibition of platelet aggregation, 
adverse effects in patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and those with 
certain renal diseases, as well as complicating antihypertensive therapies 
involving diuretics or beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Perhaps most importantly, 
NSAIDs disrupt the gastrointestinal mucosal-protective and acid-limiting 
properties of prostaglandins, frequently leading to upper gastrointestinal 
erosions and ulceration, with possible subsequent hemorrhage and perforation. 
These complications can be reduced through identification of patients at risk, 
with circumspect use of NSAIDs, careful functional monitoring, and, in the case 
of gastrointestinal toxicity, co-administration of such agents as misoprostol or 
omeprazole. However, these strategies introduce complexity into the treatment 
paradigm. Moreover, side effects and adverse events may be significantly reduced 
through the use of COX-2-specific inhibitors, new agents that alleviate pain and 
inflammation without the liability for adverse events caused by COX-1 
inhibition.

PURPOSE: Geographic atrophy (GA) is the advanced form of the non-neovascular 
(dry) type of age-related macular degeneration. Presently, GA cannot be treated. 
However, new therapies administered by intravitreal injection are in late-stage 
development. These can slow down, but do not stop or reverse, GA progression. 
The acceptability of these emerging therapies to people with GA is currently 
unknown. The present case study explores the perspectives of a person living 
with GA who took part in the terminated Phase 3 clinical trial of Lampalizumab, 
a candidate intravitreal treatment for GA. We explored this patient's 
perspective on the retrospective acceptability of regular Lampalizumab 
injections, and the prospective acceptability of future intravitreal therapies 
for GA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 78-year-old woman living in the UK was recruited as part 
of a mixed-methods pilot study and interviewed by telephone, regarding: her 
experience of the Lampalizumab trial injections; and her thoughts regarding 
emerging intravitreal therapies for GA. The Framework Method was used for 
initial inductive analysis of the interview transcript. Subsequently, deductive 
analysis was undertaken, informed by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability 
(TFA).
RESULTS: For this participant, intravitreal injections in the Lampalizumab trial 
were acceptable, although streamlining processes within the clinic would have 
improved the patient experience. Regarding prospective acceptability of new 
intravitreal therapies, the participant considered a delay in progression of GA 
a valuable goal. Potential discomfort, anxiety and inconvenience associated with 
regular intravitreal injections would be acceptable in the context of preserving 
her vision for as long as possible.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of one participant's experience demonstrates the value of 
exploring GA patients' unique views on the acceptability of new intravitreal 
treatments. Larger prospective studies will provide more insight that help to 
optimise treatment design and delivery, thereby maximising likelihood of 
adherence and persistence when these therapies eventually arrive in clinic.

BACKGROUND: The perception of COVID-19 vaccines as being unsafe is a major 
barrier to receiving the vaccine. Providing the public with accurate data 
regarding the vaccines would reduce vaccine hesitancy.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data on the side 
effects experienced by the vaccinated population to assess the safety of the 
inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.
RESULTS: The majority of the study participants (n = 386) were female (71.9%), 
and 38.6% of them were under 30 years old. Around half of the participants 
(52.8%) reported side effects after receiving the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. 
Fatigue (85.1%), a sore arm at the site of the injection (82.1%), and discomfort 
(67.2%) were the most commonly reported side effects after the first dose. 
Reporting side effects was significantly associated with the female sex (p-value 
= 0.027). Significant associations between being female and experiencing chills, 
muscle or joint pain, anorexia, drowsiness, and hair loss were also found, as 
well as being above the age of 30 and experiencing a cough. Being a smoker was 
significantly associated with experiencing a cough, and a headache. Furthermore, 
chills, and a sore throat were significantly associated with individuals who had 
not been infected before.
CONCLUSION: Mild side effects were reported after receiving the inactivated 
COVID-19 vaccine. Fatigue was the most commonly reported side effect. Females, 
older adults, smokers, and those who had never been infected with COVID-19 had a 
greater susceptibility to certain side effects.

Introduction  Optimizing hemophilia care remains challenging in developing 
countries. Burden-of-disease studies are important to develop strategies for 
improving hemophilia care. Aim  The HAEMOcare study evaluated the factors 
contributing to hemophilia-related orthopedic disease burden in developing 
countries. Methods  HAEMOcare was a noninterventional, cross-sectional, 
epidemiological study conducted in Algeria, India, Morocco, Oman, and South 
Africa. Male patients with severe hemophilia ( N  = 282) aged ≥6 years, without 
or with inhibitors, being treated on-demand for bleeding were included. 
Hemophilia-related orthopedic clinical and functional status was assessed using 
the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), radiological status with the 
Pettersson Score, and quality of life with the EuroQol five-dimension 
questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Direct and indirect economic costs of hemophilia care 
were also calculated. Results  Patients (mean [standard deviation, SD] age: 20.8 
[10.6] years) experienced a mean annualized bleeding rate of 25.8. Overall mean 
(SD) HJHS and Pettersson score were 17.9 (12.8) and 15.0 (13.5), respectively; 
scores were similar between patients without or with inhibitors ( p  = 0.21 and 
0.76, respectively). Approximately 70% of adults reported problems relating to 
pain/discomfort and mobility parameters in the EQ-5D-3L. Mean distance to a 
hemophilia treatment center (HTC) was 79.4 km. As expected, total costs of 
hemophilia were statistically significantly higher in patients with inhibitors 
versus without inhibitors ( p  = 0.002). Conclusion  Inadequate access to HTCs 
and expert care, along with high bleeding rates, led to equivalent 
hemophilia-related orthopedic morbidity between hemophilia patients without and 
with inhibitors. HAEMOcare documented the economic and disease burdens 
associated with suboptimal hemophilia care in developing countries.

BACKGROUND: Majority of Nepalese women live in remote rural areas, where health 
services are not easily accessible. We determined the validity of Menopause 
Rating Scale (MRS) as a screening tool for identification of women with severe 
menopausal symptoms and cut-off MRS score for referral.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out between February and August, 
2008. Trained health workers administered MRS and a questionnaire to 729 women 
(40 to 65 years) attending health screening camps in Kaski district of Western 
Development Region of Nepal. Information about demographics, menopausal status, 
and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), chronic disease, self-perceived 
general health and reproductive history was also collected. Menopausal status 
was classified according to the Staging of Reproductive Ageing Workshop (STRAW). 
We calculated rates of menopausal symptoms, sensitivity, and specificity and 
likelihood ratios of MRS scores for referral to a gynaecologist. We also carried 
out multivariate analyses to identify the predictors for referral to a 
gynaecologist for severe symptoms.
RESULTS: A total 729 women were interviewed. Mean age at menopause was 49.9 
years (SD 5.6). Most frequently reported symptoms were, sleeping problems (574, 
78.7%), physical and mental exhaustion (73.5%), hot flushes (508, 69.7%), joint 
and muscular discomfort (500, 68.6%) and dryness of vagina (449, 61.6%). 
Postmenopausal women (247, 33.9%) and perimenopausal (215, 29.5%) women together 
experienced significantly higher prevalence of all symptoms than the 
premenopausal (267, 36.6%) women. MRS score of ≥16 had highest ratio for 
(sensitivity + specificity)/2. Women who reported urogenital symptoms [OR 5.29, 
95% CI 2.59, 10.78], and self perceived general health as poor [OR 1.29, 95% CI 
1.11, 1.53] were more likely to be referred to a gynaecologist for severe 
menopausal symptoms. While women reporting somatic [OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63, 0.82] 
and psychological [OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74, 0.99] symptoms were less likely to be 
referred.
CONCLUSION: MRS may be used as a screening tool at a cut-off score of ≥16 with 
least misclassification rate. However, its utility may be limited by woman's 
general health status and occurrence of urogenital symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of fractures of the distal radius can involve the 
implantation of bone scaffolding materials (bone grafts and substitutes) into 
bony defects that frequently arise after fracture reduction.
OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence from randomised controlled trials evaluating 
the implanting of bone scaffolding materials for treating distal radial 
fractures in adults.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register (June 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, conference proceedings and 
reference lists. No language restrictions were applied.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials 
evaluating the use of bone scaffolding for treating distal radial fracture in 
adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two people independently selected studies and 
undertook assessment and data collection.
MAIN RESULTS: Ten heterogenous trials involving 874 adults with generally 
unstable fractures were grouped into six comparisons. No trial had proven 
allocation concealment. Four trials (239 participants) found implantation of 
bone scaffolding (autogenous bone graft (one trial); Norian SRS - a bone 
substitute (two trials); methylmethacrylate cement (one trial)) improved 
anatomical outcomes compared with plaster cast alone; and two found it improved 
function. Reported complications of bone scaffolding were transient discomfort 
resulting from extraosseous deposits of Norian SRS; with surgical removal of one 
intra-articular deposit. One trial (323 participants) comparing bone substitute 
(Norian SRS) versus plaster cast or external fixation found no difference in 
functional or anatomical outcomes at one year. Statistically significant 
complications in the respective groups were extraosseous Norian SRS deposits and 
pin track infection. One trial (48 participants with external fixation) found 
that autogenous bone graft did not significantly change outcome. There was one 
serious donor-site complication. One trial (21 participants) found some 
indication of worse outcomes for hydroxyapatite bone cement compared with 
Kapandji's intrafocal pinning. Three trials (180 participants) found bone 
scaffolding (autogenous bone graft (one trial); Norian SRS (one trial); 
methylmethacrylate cement (one trial)) gave no significant difference in 
functional outcomes but some indication of better anatomical outcomes compared 
with external fixation. Most reported complications were associated with 
external fixation; extraosseous deposits of Norian SRS occurred in one trial. 
One trial (93 participants with dorsal plate fixation) found autografts slightly 
improved wrist function compared with allogenic bone material but with an excess 
of donor site complications.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Bone scaffolding may improve anatomical outcome compared 
with plaster cast alone but there is insufficient evidence to conclude on 
functional outcome and safety; or for other comparisons.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of transforaminal endoscopic nerve root 
decompression for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS).
METHODS: From July 2011 to April 2016, 96 cases of single segment DLSS were 
involved. All the patients had unilateral lower extremity neurological symptoms, 
signs, neurogenic intermittent claudication of less than 500 m. Imaging 
examinations (CT or MRI) or diagnostic nerve root block confirmed single segment 
degeneration. The mean age was (71.6±5.4) years, male: 55 cases, female: 41 
cases. Their intraoperative blood loss, operation time, complications, 
ambulation time and discharge time were recorded. Leg pain VAS, ODI were used to 
evaluate the pain and lumbar function of the patients. The clinical efficacy was 
evaluated by Nakai evaluation.
RESULTS: All the patients were performed endoscopic decompression of the lateral 
recess and nerve root by removing the ventral part of the superior facet joint, 
the ligamentum flavum and the intervertebral disc. The decompression range was 
from the inferior edge of the upper pedicle to the superior edge of the lower 
pedicle. The nerve root was detected to have no compression and the pulse of 
nerve root returned to normal. The patient got ambulant on the operation day and 
discharged if he had no discomfort symptom. In the study, 68 cases got follow 
up. The mean follow-up time was 12.1 months (6-63 months). The VAS at different 
follow-up time points was improved relative to the baseline, and the difference 
was statistically significant (F=491.60, P<0.001). The ODI at different 
follow-up time points was improved relative to the baseline, and the difference 
was statistically significant (F=189.91, P<0.001). The excellent and good rates 
of Nakai evaluation were 79.4% (excellent in 42 cases, good in 12 cases, fair in 
10 cases and poor in 4 cases). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 
(49.29±11.86) mL. The mean operation time was (92.46±21.34) min. The mean 
ambulation time was 1.8 h. The mean discharge time was 2.3 days. Postoperative 
epidural hematoma was found in 1 case. Foot drop was found in 1 case. Second 
stage open surgery was performed in 6 cases.
CONCLUSION: We can apply transforaminal endoscopic decompression for the 
patients of lumbar spinal stenosis who have unilateral nerve root irritation. 
Patients with transforaminal endoscopic decompression can get less surgical 
trauma, quick recovery and obtain good short-term outcome.

OBJECTIVE: To assess patients' self-estimates of the burden of disease in 
vasculitis and to compare data across patient populations from the US, Germany, 
and the UK. Outcome assessment in vasculitis primarily focuses on physician 
evaluations of disease activity and damage. Little is known about the patients' 
perspectives regarding the burden of disease.
METHODS: Patients ranked (scale 0-5) a list of vasculitis-related items to 
estimate a combination of pain, interference with daily function, discomfort 
and/or annoyance, anxiety/psychological impact, and medical importance. Patients 
were also asked to list the 5 most troublesome aspects of the disease.
RESULTS: Data from 264 patients with vasculitis from 3 countries were collected. 
Wegener's granulomatosis was the predominant disease, comprising 63% of the 
cohort. Diagnoses were confirmed by physicians in 98% of cases. The most common 
item from the free-text sections was fatigue (75%), followed by pain (31%), 
musculoskeletal symptoms (24%), difficulty breathing (19%), financial aspects 
(13%), nasal discharge/crusting (14%), and weight gain (10%). Rankings of 
individual items varied substantially: fatigue (3.5), loss of energy (3.4), 
weight gain (3.1), joint pain (3.0), and sinusitis (3.0) were the highest-ranked 
symptoms among those manifestations experienced by at least 50% of patients. 
Several severe manifestations (e.g., dialysis, seizures, oxygen dependency) were 
ranked lower (<3.0).
CONCLUSION: Fatigue and reduced energy level are considered the most important 
disease burdens by patients with vasculitis; manifestations associated with 
organ damage were rated lower. The patients' perspectives of the impact of 
vasculitis differ from the physicians' ratings. Future outcome assessment in 
vasculitis should include the patients' perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Workplace musculoskeletal disorders are the leading cause of 
morbidity and disability in the Australian workforce. Over one in five 
occupational therapists report workplace musculoskeletal disorders, with almost 
half reporting workplace musculoskeletal symptoms. In other health professions, 
students and novice clinicians (≤5 years practice) experience greater risk but 
little is known about occupational therapy students.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a survey including the self-reported 
Standardised Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was administered to 
occupational therapy students post work-based training. Musculoskeletal problems 
were defined as aches, pains, numbness or discomfort. Questions explored body 
sites affected, prevalence, impact on activity, need for medical assistance, 
demographic and workplace information. Prevalence was reported using descriptive 
statistics. Factors associated with workplace musculoskeletal problems over the 
previous 12 months and last 7 days were examined using logistic regression 
modelling.
RESULTS: Response rate was 53% (n = 211/397). One-third of respondents (33.6%, 
n = 71/211) reported a workplace musculoskeletal problem over 12 months. Nearly 
half (47.9%, n = 34/71) of these students reported a problem over the last 
7 days. Neck was the most commonly affected area reported for musculoskeletal 
problems over the past 12 months (24.2%, n = 51/211) and shoulder areas affected 
over the past 7 days (10.9%, n = 23/211). Musculoskeletal problems preventing 
daily activities were reported most commonly from lower back problems over 
12 months (23.9%, n = 17/71) and for shoulder problems over the last 7 days 
(21.9%, n = 7/32). Shoulders and knees were the most common body areas requiring 
medical attention. Previous musculoskeletal problems and female gender were 
associated with reported problems over 12 months and last 7 days (p < 0.05). 
Non-standard joint mobility (OR = 3.82, p = 0.002) and working in psychosocially 
focused caseloads (including mental health or case management) (OR = 3.04, 
p = 0.044) were also associated with reporting musculoskeletal problems over the 
last 7 days.
CONCLUSIONS: One in three occupational therapy students already experience 
workplace musculoskeletal problems impacting daily activities and requiring 
medical assistance prior to graduation. High prevalence of musculoskeletal 
problems in this study calls for educators and researchers to find sustainable 
strategies to address these problems, with particular consideration to the 
impact of previous disorders and working in psychosocially focused caseloads on 
musculoskeletal health.

INTRODUCTION: In the early weeks after surgery, patients may experience 
cognitive changes and impaired memory and concentration-changes commonly 
referred to as postoperative cognitive decline. It is often the patient and/or a 
relative that initially detects a change in cognitive capacity after surgery, 
typically when resuming daily activities. We lack information about how patients 
experience early postoperative cognition (delayed neurocognitive recovery) and 
if these experiences can be reflected in biochemical pattern of inflammatory 
signalling molecules, cognitive function as well as on quality of postoperative 
recovery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study has a mixed-methods design that is integration 
of qualitative and quantitative data within a single investigation. Participants 
included will be patients aged ≥60 years that are undergoing major elective 
joint replacement surgery (n=40) and their relative. Patient's experience of 
his/her early cognition will be captured by interviews on postoperative day 
13-16 during the follow-up visit. A relative will also be interviewed on the 
same day or the day after. Cognitive function will be measured preoperatively 
and on postoperative day 13-16 using the International Study Group of 
Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction test battery. Symptoms/discomfort will be 
measured preoperatively and postoperatively (on postoperative day 1 and 2 and at 
the follow-up visit day 13-16) by the Swedish version of Quality of Recovery and 
by a visual analogue scale assessing pain intensity. Biomarkers will also be 
collected at the same time points. The findings from the interviews will be 
sorted out depending on group stratification (no delayed neurocognitive recovery 
and delayed neurocognitive recovery). The qualitative and quantitative findings 
will be compared to seek for similarities and differences.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project has been approved by the Swedish Ethical 
Review Authority (2019-02968) and will follow the principles outlined in the 
1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Results from this study will 
be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, scientific conferences and in social 
media.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an inflammatory arthritis of 
unknown etiology, which lasts for greater than 6 weeks with onset before 
16 years of age. JIA is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children. 
NSAIDs have been the mainstay of initial management with naproxen (NAP) being 
commonly used, but they may cause serious side effects such as gastric ulcers 
which can be reduced by concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors, 
such as esomeprazole (ESO).
METHODS: Primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 
fixed doses of NAP/ESO in JIA patients aged 12 to 16 years. Forty-six children 
and adolescents with JIA by International League of Associations for 
Rheumatology criteria, mean age of 13.6 years, from 18 US sites were 
prospectively enrolled over 2 years and followed for up to 6 months. Doses of 
the NAP/ESO fixed combination were based on baseline weight. The exploratory 
efficacy outcome was assessed with the ACR Pediatric-30, - 50, - 70, - 90 
Response and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) discomfort and 
functional scores at months 1, 3, and 6 as change from baseline. Occurrence and 
causality were assessed for treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) and discontinuations 
were monitored monthly.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients received at least 1 dose of naproxen/esomeprazole 
and 36 completed the trial. Thirty-seven (80.4%) had at least 1 treatment 
emergent adverse event (TEAE) and, with the exception of 2 events in one 
patient, all of the TEAEs were mild or moderate. Frequent TEAEs (≥5% of 
patients) were upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal related. Eleven 
(23.9%) had at least 1 TEAE considered to be related to study drug. Four 
patients (8.7%) discontinued due to a TEAE with one of these being the only 
serious AE reported, acute hepatitis. Mean number of active joints at baseline 
was 3.1. Improvement in JIA signs and symptoms occurred at most assessments and 
by month 6, the percentage of patients with an ACR Pediatric-30, - 50, - 70, 
and - 90 Response was 47.1, 38.2, 32.4, and 17.6%, respectively. The percent of 
patients achieving ACR Pediatric response increased over time. CHAQ discomfort 
improved at each assessment and functional scores improved at all assessments 
for 'Arising, Walking, and Activities' with several improved for 'Dressing and 
Grooming, Eating, Hygiene, and Grip'. There was no indication of a dose-related 
efficacy effect.
CONCLUSION: NAP/ESO was well tolerated in JIA patients aged 12 to 16 years with 
high levels of response to ACR criteria. No new safety signals were identified 
for the well-characterized components of this fixed dosed JIA treatment, which 
was developed to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers.

Over the past decades, the number of patients with dry eye disease (DED) has 
increased dramatically. The incidence of DED is higher in Asia than in Europe 
and North America, suggesting the involvement of cultural or racial factors in 
DED etiology. Although many definitions of DED have been used, discrepancies 
exist between the various definitions of dry eye disease (DED) used across the 
globe. This article presents a clinical consensus on the definition of DED, as 
formulated in four meetings with global DED experts. The proposed new definition 
is as follows: "Dry eye is a multifactorial disease characterized by a 
persistently unstable and/or deficient tear film (TF) causing discomfort and/or 
visual impairment, accompanied by variable degrees of ocular surface 
epitheliopathy, inflammation and neurosensory abnormalities." The key criteria 
for the diagnosis of DED are unstable TF, inflammation, ocular discomfort and 
visual impairment. This definition also recommends the assessment of ocular 
surface epitheliopathy and neurosensory abnormalities in each patient with 
suspected DED. It is easily applicable in clinical practice and should help 
practitioners diagnose DED consistently. This consensus definition of DED should 
also help to guide research and clinical trials that, to date, have been 
hampered by the lack of an established surrogate endpoint.

Introduction: With the global prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
an increasing number of people are experiencing respiratory discomfort. 
Respiratory biomechanics can monitor breathing patterns and respiratory 
movements and it is easier to prevent, diagnose, treat or rehabilitate. However, 
there is still a lack of global knowledge structure in the field of respiratory 
biomechanics. With the help of CiteSpace software, we aim to help researchers 
identify potential collaborators and collaborating institutions, hotspots and 
research frontiers in respiratory biomechanics. Methods: Articles on respiratory 
biomechanics from 2003 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core 
Collection by using a specific strategy, resulting a total of 2,850 
publications. We used CiteSpace 6.1.R6 to analyze the year of publication, 
journal/journals cited, country, institution, author/authors cited, references, 
keywords and research trends. Co-citation maps were created to visually observe 
research hot spots and knowledge structures. Results and discussion: The number 
of annual publications gradually increased over the past 20 years. Medical 
Physics published the most articles and had the most citations in this study. 
The United States was the most influential country, with the highest number and 
centrality of publications. The most productive and influential institution was 
Harvard University in the United States. Keall PJ was the most productive author 
and MCCLELLAND JR was the most cited authors The article by Keall PJ (2006) 
article (cocitation counts: 55) and the article by McClelland JR (2013) were the 
most representative and symbolic references, with the highest cocitation number 
and centrality, respectively. The top keywords were "radiotherapy", "volume", 
and "ventilation". The top Frontier keywords were "organ motion," "deep 
inspiration," and "deep learning". The keywords were clustered to form seven 
labels. Currently, the main area of research in respiratory biomechanics is 
respiratory motion related to imaging techniques. Future research may focus on 
respiratory assistance techniques and respiratory detection techniques. At the 
same time, in the future, we will pay attention to personalized medicine and 
precision medicine, so that people can monitor their health status anytime and 
anywhere.

Research suggests a link between Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome (DS) and 
the overproduction of amyloid plaques. Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
we can assess the in-vivo regional amyloid load using several available ligands. 
To measure amyloid distributions in specific brain regions, a brain atlas is 
used. A popular method of creating a brain atlas is to segment a participant's 
structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Acquiring an MRI is often 
challenging in intellectually-imparied populations because of contraindications 
or data exclusion due to significant motion artifacts or incomplete sequences 
related to general discomfort. When an MRI cannot be acquired, it is typically 
replaced with a standardized brain atlas derived from neurotypical populations 
(i.e. healthy individuals without DS) which may be inappropriate for use in DS. 
In this project, we create a series of disease and diagnosis-specific 
(cognitively stable (CS-DS), mild cognitive impairment (MCI-DS), and dementia 
(DEM-DS)) probabilistic group atlases of participants with DS and evaluate their 
accuracy of quantifying regional amyloid load compared to the individually-based 
MRI segmentations. Further, we compare the diagnostic-specific atlases with a 
probabilistic atlas constructed from similar-aged cognitively-stable 
neurotypical participants. We hypothesized that regional PET signals will best 
match the individually-based MRI segmentations by using DS group atlases that 
aligns with a participant's disorder and disease status (e.g. DS and MCI-DS). 
Our results vary by brain region but generally show that using a 
disorder-specific atlas in DS better matches the individually-based MRI 
segmentations than using an atlas constructed from cognitively-stable 
neurotypical participants. We found no additional benefit of using 
diagnose-specific atlases matching disease status. All atlases are made publicly 
available for the research community.
HIGHLIGHT: Down syndrome (DS) joint-label-fusion atlases provide accurate 
positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid measurements.A disorder-specific DS 
atlas is better than a neurotypical atlas for PET quantification.It is not 
necessary to use a disease-state-specific atlas for quantification in aged 
DS.Dorsal striatum results vary, possibly due to this region and dementia 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as 
chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the 
middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) 
through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear 
discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, one of the possible treatments 
for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. 
Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such 
as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antiseptics or their 
application can cause irritation of the skin of the outer ear, manifesting as 
discomfort, pain or itching. Some antiseptics (such as alcohol) may have the 
potential to be toxic to the inner ear (ototoxicity), with a possible increased 
risk of causing sensorineural hearing loss, dizziness or tinnitus.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with chronic 
suppurative otitis media.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane 
ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via 
the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of 
Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and 
unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at 
least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had 
chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had 
continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or 
combination of, topical antiseptic agent of any class, applied directly into the 
ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting 
procedure. Two main comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: a) placebo 
or no intervention; and b) another topical antiseptic (e.g. topical antiseptic A 
versus topical antiseptic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where 
both groups of patients had received topical antiseptics a) alone or with aural 
toileting and b) on top of antibiotic treatment.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard Cochrane methodological 
procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each 
outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' 
(whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to 
two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related 
quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort 
or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications 
and ototoxicity measured in several ways.
MAIN RESULTS: Five studies were included. It was not possible to calculate the 
total number of participants as two studies only provided the number of ears 
included in the study. A. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus placebo or no 
treatment (all patients had aural toileting) Three studies compared topical 
antiseptics with no treatment, with one study reporting results we could use 
(254 children; cluster-RCT). This compared the instillation of boric acid in 
alcohol drops versus no ear drops for one month (both arms used daily dry 
mopping). We made adjustments to the data to account for the intra-cluster 
correlation. The very low certainty of the evidence means it is uncertain 
whether or not treatment with an antiseptic leads to an increase in resolution 
of ear discharge at both four weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.94, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.16; 174 participants) and at three to four months (RR 
1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.47; 180 participants). This study narratively described 
no differences in suspected ototoxicity or hearing outcomes between the arms 
(very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported results for 
health-related quality of life, adverse effects or serious complications. B. 
Topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B Two studies compared different 
antiseptics but only one (93 participants), comparing a single instillation of 
boric acid powder with daily acetic acid ear drops, provided any information for 
this comparison. The very low certainty of the evidence means that it is 
uncertain whether more patients had resolution of ear discharge with boric acid 
powder compared to acetic acid at four weeks (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.53; 93 
participants), or whether there was a difference between the arms with respect 
to ear discomfort due to the low number of reported events (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 
to 1.81; 93 participants). Narratively, the study reported no difference in 
hearing outcomes between the groups. None of the included studies reported any 
of the other primary or secondary outcomes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to paucity of the evidence and the very low certainty 
of that which is available the effectiveness and safety profile of antiseptics 
in the treatment of CSOM is uncertain.

Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is increasingly used to decrease discomfort among 
patients owing to its small size. However, VCE has a major drawback of not 
having narrow band imaging (NBI) functionality. The current VCE has the 
traditional white light imaging (WLI) only, which has poor performance in the 
computer-aided detection (CAD) of different types of cancer compared to NBI. 
Specific cancers, such as esophageal cancer (EC), do not exhibit any early 
biomarkers, making their early detection difficult. In most cases, the symptoms 
are unnoticeable, and EC is diagnosed only in later stages, making its 5-year 
survival rate below 20% on average. NBI filters provide particular wavelengths 
that increase the contrast and enhance certain features of the mucosa, thereby 
enabling early identification of EC. However, VCE does not have a slot for NBI 
functionality because its size cannot be increased. Hence, NBI image conversion 
from WLI can presently only be achieved in post-processing. In this study, a 
complete arithmetic assessment of the decorrelated color space was conducted to 
generate NBI images from WLI images for VCE of the esophagus. Three parameters, 
structural similarity index metric (SSIM), entropy, and peak-signal-to-noise 
ratio (PSNR), were used to assess the simulated NBI images. Results show the 
good performance of the NBI image reproduction method with SSIM, entropy 
difference, and PSNR values of 93.215%, 4.360, and 28.064 dB, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Distal ulna head or neck fracture is commonly associated with distal 
radius fracture. Treatment of these fractures remains controversial. Plate 
osteosynthesis is commonly performed. The purpose of this study was to observe 
clinical and radiological outcomes in ulna hook plate osteosynthesis for distal 
ulna fracture associated with distal radius fracture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study between 2010 and 2018 included 
patients presenting combined displaced distal ulna fracture and distal radius 
fracture who were treated with ulna hook plate osteosynthesis. Patient 
evaluation included pain measurement with the visual analog scale, wrist range 
of motion, grip and pinch strengths, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and 
Hand (Q-DASH) score, and Mayo wrist score. Preoperative radiographs were 
reviewed to classify the distal ulna fracture according to Biyani. Bone union 
was evaluated on postoperative X-rays. At final follow-up, the usual 
radiographic parameters were measured and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) 
osteoarthritis was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were included. Mean age was 63 years old and 
mean follow-up was 28 months. According to the Biyani classification, there were 
12 type I, 4 type II, 8 type III, and 24 type IV distal ulna fractures. Wrist 
flexion was 60°, extension 57°, pronation 85°, and supination 80°. Grip strength 
was 21 kg (86% of the uninjured opposite side). Pinch strength was 6.6 kg (92% 
of the uninjured opposite side). Clinical scores were very good to excellent, 
with a mean Q-DASH of 12 and a Mayo wrist score of 90. Discomfort or pain due to 
the implant that required implant removal was reported in 29%, and was higher in 
younger patients. Nonunion was observed in two cases and secondary implant 
displacement in one case. These three cases required secondary intervention with 
ulna head resection, which was higher in Biyani type IV. DRUJ osteoarthritis was 
observed in 12 patients (31%) and was higher in older patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Ulna hook plate fixation gives good clinical results and a high 
rate of fracture union, but complications are common. Implant irritation is a 
frequent complication, especially in young patients, and often requires implant 
removal.

BACKGROUND: Women's physical and mental ill-health such as stress-related 
symptoms, depression, pain, hypertension and urogenital health shows a marked 
increase around the ages 45-55 years. These women are an important group for 
Primary Health Care (PHC) due to their prevalent symptoms and illnesses. The aim 
of this study was to estimate the prevalence of somatic, psychological and 
urogenital symptoms in women aged 45-55 attending PHC and evaluate factors 
associated with severe symptoms.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-one women were recruited from PHC in 
southwestern Sweden. Data were obtained from two self-reported questionnaires, 
the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating 
Scale (MADRS).
RESULTS: Exhaustion, depressive mood, muscle and joint problems, sleep and 
sexual problems were the most prevalent reported symptoms. Half of the women 
reported heart discomfort. Depression and increasing age were correlated to more 
severe symptoms.
CONCLUSION: We recommend that cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal 
symptoms, sexual problems, sleeping problems and mental health should be 
actively asked for when women aged 45 to 55 attend PHC. We propose that 
preventive counselling of women in PHC before the age 45 should be evaluated in 
future studies.

BACKGROUND: Blood pressure diseases have increasingly been identified as among 
the main factors threatening human health. How to accurately and conveniently 
measure blood pressure is the key to the implementation of effective prevention 
and control measures for blood pressure diseases. Traditional blood pressure 
measurement methods exhibit many inherent disadvantages, for example, the time 
needed for each measurement is difficult to determine, continuous measurement 
causes discomfort, and the measurement process is relatively cumbersome. 
Wearable devices that enable continuous measurement of blood pressure provide 
new opportunities and hopes. Although machine learning methods for blood 
pressure prediction have been studied, the accuracy of the results does not 
satisfy the needs of practical applications.
RESULTS: This paper proposes an efficient blood pressure prediction method based 
on the support vector machine regression (SVR) algorithm to solve the key gap 
between the need for continuous measurement for prophylaxis and the lack of an 
effective method for continuous measurement. The results of the algorithm were 
compared with those obtained from two classical machine learning algorithms, 
i.e., linear regression (LinearR), back propagation neural network (BP), with 
respect to six evaluation indexes (accuracy, pass rate, mean absolute percentage 
error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared coefficient of determination 
(R2) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). The experimental results 
showed that the SVR model can accurately and effectively predict blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: The multi-feature joint training and predicting techniques in 
machine learning can potentially complement and greatly improve the accuracy of 
traditional blood pressure measurement, resulting in better disease 
classification and more accurate clinical judgements.

INTRODUCTION: Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a 
corresponding external acoustic stimulus. Bimodal neuromodulation is emerging as 
a promising treatment for this condition. The main objectives of this study are 
to investigate the relevance of interstimulus timing and the choices of acoustic 
and tongue stimuli for a proprietary bimodal (auditory and somatosensory) 
neuromodulation device, as well as to explore whether specific subtypes of 
patients are differentially responsive to this novel intervention for reducing 
the symptoms of chronic tinnitus.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a two-site, randomised, triple-blind, exploratory 
study of a proprietary neuromodulation device with a pre-post and 12-month 
follow-up design. Three different bimodal stimulation parameter sets will be 
examined. The study will enrol 342 patients, split 80:20 between two sites 
(Dublin, Ireland and Regensburg, Germany), to complete 12 weeks of treatment 
with the device. Patients will be allocated to one of three arms using a 
stepwise stratification according to four binary categories: tinnitus tonality, 
sound level tolerance (using loudness discomfort level of <60 dB SL as an 
indicator for hyperacusis), hearing thresholds and presence of a noise-induced 
audiometric profile. The main indicators of relative clinical efficacy for the 
three different parameter sets are two patient-reported outcomes measures, the 
Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and the Tinnitus Functional Index, after 12 weeks of 
intervention. Clinical efficacy will be further explored in a series of patient 
subtypes, split by the stratification variables and by presence of a somatic 
tinnitus. Evidence for sustained effects on the psychological and functional 
impact of tinnitus will be followed up for 12 months. Safety data will be 
collected and reported. A number of feasibility measures to inform future trial 
design include: reasons for exclusion, completeness of data collection, 
attrition rates, patient's adherence to the device usage as per manufacturer's 
instructions and evaluation of alternative methods for estimating tinnitus 
impact and tinnitus loudness.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol is approved by the Tallaght 
Hospital/St. James's Hospital Joint Research Ethics Committee in Dublin, 
Ireland, and by the Ethics Committee of the University Clinic Regensburg, 
Germany. Findings will be disseminated to relevant research, clinical, health 
service and patient communities through publications in peer-reviewed and 
popular science journals and presentations at scientific and clinical 
conferences.

In the general population, physical activity is associated with improved health 
outcomes. However, long-term sports participation may be associated with adverse 
outcomes, particularly at the elite level. The aims of this study were to assess 
morbidity and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) amongst former rugby 
players, compared to an age-standardised general population sample. A 
cross-sectional study of former elite, male, rugby players (n = 259) was 
undertaken, and standardised morbidity ratios (SMR) calculated, assessing 
morbidity prevalence relative to English Longitudinal Study of Aging 
participants (ELSA, n = 5186). HrQoL, measured using the EQ-5D, was compared to 
a Health Survey for England (HSE, n = 2981) sample. In SMR analyses of 
participants aged 50+, diabetes was significantly lower amongst former players, 
(0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.66), whereas osteoarthritis (4.00, 95% CI 3.32-4.81), joint 
replacement (6.02, 95% CI 4.66-7.77), osteoporosis (2.69, 95% CI 1.35-5.38), and 
anxiety (2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.61) were significantly higher. More problems in 
HrQoL were reported amongst former players within the domains of mobility 
(p < 0.001), self-care (p = 0.041), usual activities (p < 0.001) and 
pain/discomfort (p < 0.001). Morbidity and HrQoL differ between players and the 
general population, with higher musculoskeletal morbidity and lower diabetes 
amongst former players. The magnitude of musculoskeletal morbidity may warrant 
proactive osteoarthritis management within this population.

RATIONALE: Talar fracture accompanied with malleolar fracture is rare, and its 
management is complex. Ankle soft tissue is much thinner than other parts of the 
human body, and the shape of the ankle makes wounds difficult to close 
immediately after surgery, which may result in poor skin condition if the wound 
tension is too high. However, joint congruity and osteonecrosis are the main 
concerns of talar fracture.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old man presented at the emergency department 
following a motorcycle accident.
DIAGNOSES: Physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness of the left 
ankle and midfoot. The patient had comminuted talar fracture and was indicated 
for dual-screw fixation or even plate with screw fixation.
INTERVENTIONS: We performed single screw fixation after assessing the soft 
tissue condition and employed a technique of using continuous longitudinal force 
to bring together fracture fragments (ankle ligamentotaxis) during surgery. Open 
reduction with a mini-hook plate and tension band wire was used for bimalleolar 
fracture repair using the combined anteromedial and anterolateral approach with 
extension of the incision. Kirschner wire for temporary fixation was performed 
using ligamentotaxis, and a 2.4 headless screw was inserted from the 
posteromedial to the anterolateral direction.
OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged with a standard short leg splint and was 
instructed not to bear weight on the affected ankle for 2 months. The patient 
walked well without discomfort, and the Hawkins sign was clearly visible. Single 
screw fixation preserves the integrity of the talus bone as minimal space is 
used for this operative technique. Single screw fixation preserves more bony 
stock when most of the internal fixator is located within the bone. 
Additionally, surgery time is shorter than multiple implantations even when 
performing the same procedure; as a result, there was less ankle soft tissue 
swelling.
LESSONS: This case provides evidence of using the single screw fixation 
technique for addressing both malleolar and talar fractures, and that talar 
fracture management can be less aggressive with limited weight bearing and 
initial limited range of motion given the presence of malleolar fracture. The 
alignment and stability of bony fragments also benefit from ankle 
ligamentotaxis.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The LFA REAL™ is a measurement system for evaluating lupus 
disease activity from both clinician and patient perspectives. Patients' 
viewpoints are captured using a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire. A 
series of visual analog scales are designed to rate disease severity and 
progress over the past 4 weeks. Brief instructions guide the patient to 
distinguish between active, potentially reversible symptoms and chronic pain or 
discomfort that are more likely due to damage. Beyond its simplicity and 
efficiency, the PRO can provide versatile assessments from a global, 
organ-based, and symptom-specific level. This paper describes the 
patient-centered approach used to evaluate the content validity of the LFA-REAL 
PRO.
METHODS: The PRO was developed in accordance with FDA guidance. A two-phase 
qualitative study was performed with 25 lupus patients, 10 who participated in 
concept elicitation (Phase 1) and 15 in cognitive debriefing interviews (Phase 
2). Qualitative data were analyzed using ATLAS.ti software v7.5. Upon completion 
of the interviews, participants completed the draft PRO and additional measures 
to characterize the sample.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 45.6 and 88% were female, as expected 
in a lupus population. The mean SF-36 physical component score was 29.8 and the 
mean mental component score was 46.4. Phase 1 elicited symptom saturation and 
mapping of the draft PRO. Fatigue was reported by 100% of patients, highlighting 
its importance as a measurable domain. Additionally, 100% of patients 
spontaneously mentioned arthritis, which may be more important to this group 
than previously estimated, substantiating the approach of this PRO to break down 
components of arthritis into joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Shortness of 
breath and fever were reported more frequently than expected. Phase 2 data 
demonstrated that participants found the instrument easy to use and offered 
recommendations to improve clarity, leading to adjustments in wording and 
formatting.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the LFA-REAL PRO has content validity and, 
with some modifications suggested by participants, is ready for quantitative 
validation, including tests of reliability, validity, responsiveness to change, 
and performance relative to other PROs used in lupus trials. After validation, 
the LFA-REAL system is intended for use in clinical practice and research.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is 
characterized by clinical features that typically develop in childhood and 
resemble some features of accelerated aging. Children with HGPS usually appear 
normal at birth. Profound failure to thrive occurs during the first year. 
Characteristic facial features include head that is disproportionately large for 
the face, narrow nasal ridge, narrow nasal tip, thin vermilion of the upper and 
lower lips, small mouth, and retro- and micrognathia. Common features include 
loss of subcutaneous fat, delayed eruption and loss of primary teeth, abnormal 
skin with small outpouchings over the abdomen and upper thighs, alopecia, nail 
dystrophy, coxa valga, and progressive joint contractures. Later findings 
include low-frequency conductive hearing loss, dental crowding, and partial lack 
of secondary tooth eruption. Motor and mental development is normal. Death 
occurs as a result of complications of severe atherosclerosis, either cardiac 
disease (myocardial infarction or heart failure) or cerebrovascular disease 
(stroke), generally between ages six and 20 years (average 14.5 years) without 
lonafarnib treatment or cardiac surgery intervention. Average life span is 
extended to approximately 17-19.5 years with lonafarnib therapy.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of classic or nonclassic genotype HGPS is 
established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, along with 
identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LMNA that results in 
production of the abnormal lamin A protein, progerin. Individuals with classic 
genotype HGPS are heterozygous for pathogenic variant c.1824C>T (~90% of 
individuals with HGPS). Individuals with nonclassic genotype HGPS have the 
characteristic clinical features of HGPS and are heterozygous for another LMNA 
pathogenic variant in exon 11 or intron 11 that results in production of 
progerin (~10% of individuals with HGPS).
MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Lonafarnib is an approved medication for HGPS; 
benefits include improved low-tone hearing, decreased headaches, decreased 
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, decreased arterial wall stiffness, and 
increased life span. Supportive care: A regular diet with frequent small meals 
is recommended. Primary tooth extractions after the secondary tooth has erupted 
and/or fully descended may be required to avoid dental crowding. Use of 
sunscreen on all exposed areas of skin, including the head, is recommended for 
outdoor activities. Hip dislocation is best managed with physical therapy and 
body bracing; reconstructive hip surgery is possible, but comorbidities of 
surgery in this high-risk population should be considered. Shoe pads are 
recommended, as lack of body fat leads to foot discomfort. Routine physical and 
occupational therapy, active stretching and strengthening exercises, and 
hydrotherapy are recommended. Maintain optimal hydration, while encouraging 
physical activity, to minimize stroke risk. Modified transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement or modified apico-aortic valve replacement are high-risk 
interventions to treat critical aortic stenosis, yielding improved cardiac 
status and quality of life and increased life span. Anticoagulation as needed 
for cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. Medication dosages are based 
on body weight or body surface area, not age. Nitroglycerin can be beneficial 
for angina; anticongestive therapy is routine for the treatment of congestive 
heart failure. General anesthesia and intubation should be performed with 
extreme caution, ideally with fiberoptic intubation, if possible. Exposure 
keratopathy can be treated with ocular lubrication. Hearing aids can be used 
when clinically necessary. Age-appropriate schooling with adaptations for 
physical needs is usually recommended. Prevention of secondary complications: 
Low-dose aspirin (2-3 mg/kg body weight) is recommended for prevention of 
cardiovascular and stroke complications. Because the stiffened peripheral 
vasculature may be less tolerant to dehydration, maintaining optimal hydration 
orally is recommended. Surveillance: Annual or semiannual electrocardiogram 
(EKG), annual echocardiogram, carotid duplex ultrasound examination, neurologic 
examination, MRI/MRA of the head and neck, lipid profile, dental examination, 
hip x-ray to evaluate for avascular necrosis and progressing coxa valga, dual 
x-ray absorptiometry and/or peripheral cutaneous computed tomography to measure 
bone density, physical therapy assessment for joint contractures, ophthalmology 
examination, audiometry, and assessment of activities of daily living. 
Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration; large crowds with taller/larger 
peers because of the risk of injury, trampolines and bouncy houses due to risk 
of hip dislocation. Physical activity should be self-limited.
GENETIC COUNSELING: Almost all individuals with HGPS have the disorder as the 
result of a de novo autosomal dominant pathogenic variant. Recurrence risk to 
the sibs of a proband is small (as HGPS is typically caused by a de novo 
pathogenic variant) but greater than that of the general population because of 
the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the LMNA pathogenic variant 
has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a 
pregnancy at increased risk is possible.

AIMS: To describe health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and identify associated 
factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with oral 
glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs).
METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional analysis included adults with T2DM 
from 11 Asian countries/regions prospectively enrolled in the Joint Asian 
Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register (2007-2019) with available EuroQol-5D 
(EQ-5D-3L) data.
RESULTS: Of 47,895 included patients, 42,813 were treated with OGLDs + lifestyle 
modifications (LSM) and 5,082 with LSM only. Among those treated with OGLDs, 60% 
received sulphonylureas (SUs), of whom 47% received gliclazide. The OGLD + LSM 
group had a lower mean EQ-5D-3L index score than the LSM-only group (p < 0.001). 
The most affected EQ-5D-3L dimensions in OGLD + LSM-treated patients were 
pain/discomfort (26.2%) and anxiety/depression (22.6%). On multivariate 
analysis, good HRQoL was positively associated with male sex, education level, 
balanced diet and regular exercise, and negatively with 
complications/comorbidities, self-reported hypoglycaemia, smoking, HbA1c, age, 
body mass index and disease duration. Patients receiving gliclazide vs 
non-gliclazide SUs had lower HbA1c and better HRQoL in all dimensions 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, physical and psychosocial-behavioural factors were 
associated with HRQoL in patients with T2DM. Our real-world data add to previous 
evidence that gliclazide is an effective OGLD, with most treated patients 
reporting good HRQoL. A plain language summary of this manuscript is available 
here.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 May 30;(5):CD007121.

BACKGROUND: Clavicle (collarbone) fractures account for around 4% of all 
fractures. Most (76%) clavicle fractures involve the middle-third section of the 
clavicle. Treatment of these fractures is usually non-surgical (conservative). 
Commonly used treatments are arm slings, strapping and figure-of-eight 
bandages.This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and 
updated in 2014.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of different methods 
for conservative (non-operative) treatment for acute (treated soon after injury) 
middle third clavicle fractures in adolescents and adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
MEDLINE (from 1966), Embase (from 1980), LILACS (from 1982), trial registers, 
orthopaedic proceedings and reference lists of articles. We applied no language 
or publication restrictions. The date of the last search was 5 January 2016.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials testing 
conservative interventions for treating adolescents and adults with acute middle 
third clavicle fractures. The primary outcomes were shoulder function or 
disability, pain and treatment failure.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For this update, two review authors selected 
eligible trials, independently assessed risk of bias and cross-checked data 
extraction. We calculated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
dichotomous variables, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for 
continuous variables. There was very limited pooling of data.
MAIN RESULTS: We included four trials in this review with 416 participants, who 
were aged 14 years or above. One new trial was included in this update.Very low 
quality evidence was available from three trials (296 participants) that 
compared the figure-of-eight bandage with an arm sling for treating acute middle 
third clavicle fractures. The three trials were underpowered and compromised by 
poor methodology. Shoulder function was assessed in different ways in the three 
trials (data for 51, 61 and 152 participants); each trial provided very low 
quality evidence of similar shoulder function in the two groups. Pooled data 
from two trials (203 participants) showed no clinical difference between groups 
after two weeks in pain (visual analogue scale: 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain); 
mean difference (MD) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 1.21; I² = 74%; 
very low quality evidence). A third trial (61 participants) provided very low 
quality evidence based on a non-validated scoring system of more pain and 
discomfort during the course of treatment in the figure-of-eight group. 
Treatment failure, measured in terms of subsequent surgery, was not reported in 
two trials; the third trial (152 participants) reported one participant in the 
arm sling group had surgery for secondary plexus nerve palsy. There was very low 
quality evidence from one trial (148 participants) of little difference in time 
to clinical fracture healing (MD 0.2 weeks, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.51); data from 
four non-symptomatic non-unions in the figure-of-eight group were not included. 
The very low evidence quality data for individual adverse outcomes (poor 
cosmetic appearance; change in allocated treatment due to pain and discomfort, 
worsened fracture position on healing; shortening > 15 mm; non-symptomatic 
non-union and permanent pain) did not confirm a difference between the two 
groups. There was no clear between group difference in the time to return to 
school or work activities (MD -0.12 weeks, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.45; 176 
participants; very low quality evidence).Moderate quality evidence was available 
from one trial (120 participants; reporting data for 101 participants), which 
evaluated therapeutic ultrasound. This trial was at low risk of bias but was 
underpowered and did not report on shoulder function or quality of life. The 
trial found no evidence of a difference between low-intensity pulsed ultrasound 
and placebo in pain, treatment failure (subsequent surgery: 6/52 versus 5/49; RR 
1.13, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.47), the time to clinical fracture healing (MD -0.32 
days, 95% CI -5.85 to 5.21), adverse events (one case of skin irritation was 
reported in each group) or time to resume previous activities.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence available from randomised controlled 
trials is insufficient to determine which methods of conservative treatment are 
the most appropriate for acute middle third clavicle fractures in adolescents 
and adults. Further research is warranted.

INTRODUCTION: Venous leg ulcers are the most common cause of leg ulcers. The aim 
of this study is to assess the effect of Combined Ultrasound and Electric Field 
Stimulation therapies (CUSEFS) on wound surface area and pain level in patients 
with venous leg ulcers, utilizing a novel device (BRH-A2 from BRH Medical, Ltd).
METHODS: This prospective case series study, conducted by the Department of 
Plastic Surgery at the Yitzhak Shamir Medical Center, Israel, collected data for 
subjects treated with CUSEFS with the BRH-A2 device, between April 2018 and 
September 2019. Measurements of wound area and assessment of pain intensity 
using a 10-point visual analog score were recorded. At the end of the four-week 
period, average wound area and pain scores were included for analysis.
RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. During the study 
period, all patients exhibited a reduction in the wound surface area. The final 
average wound surface area was reduced by 53.52% following the combined 
treatment. Eight out of the ten patients (80%) reported a reduction in pain, 
with an average pain level reduction of 64% throughout eight consecutive 
treatments.
CONCLUSION: CUSEFS therapies with BRH-A2 technology is a promising treatment for 
venous leg ulcers. In accordance with our preliminary results, this treatment 
modality can aid in the reduction of wound surface area as well as reducing the 
pain suffered by patients from these chronic wounds. Larger multicenter studies 
are needed to further quantify and qualify the beneficial effect of CUSEFS in 
venous leg ulcers and other chronic wounds.
LAY SUMMARY: Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are painful wounds occurring between the 
knee and ankle joint, that fail to heal for a period of at least two weeks and 
occur in the presence of venous disease. VLUs, are the most common cause of leg 
ulcers, affecting approximately 5% of the general population over the age of 65. 
Numerous non-invasive treatment modalities have been attempted for healing 
chronic wounds and ulceration, however, in some instances surgery, although 
invasive, is the preferred option. For many years, ultrasound (US) has been used 
therapeutically to treat chronic ulcers. US produces biophysical effects that 
are significantly beneficial to the wound healing process. Electrical 
stimulation therapy is another treatment option which contributes to wound 
healing by influencing the electrochemical wound process.Combined Modulated 
Ultrasound and Electric Field Stimulation (CUSEFS) have been shown to improve 
the healing of chronic wounds. However, research has focused predominantly on 
objective measures of healing, while less consideration has been given to 
researching the subjective discomfort and the negative impact that ulceration 
places on the patient. The aim of this study was to assess objective and 
subjective factors by measuring the short-term effect of CUSEFS on the surface 
area of wound and on pain levels in patients with venous leg ulcers (VLUs). Our 
study findings demonstrate that the combined treatment was effective in 
initiating wound healing and reducing levels of pain in chronic, stagnant,

Musculoskeletal disorders gradually affect workers in different parts of the 
world, compromising their occupational health and quality of life. Professionals 
exposed to these symptoms include the motorcycle taxi driver, whose pain is due 
to the overuse of the musculoskeletal system and little time to recover it.To 
identify the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in motorcycle taxi drivers 
in the city of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, West Amazon.Cross-sectional study, 
involving 296 motorcycle taxi drivers in the city of Rio Branco-Acre, Brazil, 
male, from December 2016 to February 2017. The Nordic Musculoskeletal 
Questionnaire was used to collect information related to symptoms (pain, 
discomfort, or numbness) in the last 7 days of work. For the exclusion criteria 
were, being female; not reside outside the city of Rio Branco, Acre; having less 
than 3 months of work activity; not be carrying out their work activities at the 
time of application of the protocol; be limited by clinical or physical issues 
at the time of application of the protocol. The data obtained in the 
questionnaire were entered into the Epidata program (Epidata Association, 
Odense, Denmark) and then transferred to the STATA 10 statistical program (Stata 
Corp., College Station), for categorization and statistical analysis.The study 
population is over 36 years old; most reported having a partner and a higher 
education level. The average daily working hours of the participants were 
12 hours, with the majority working over 12 hours daily. Most of the 
epidemiological variables factors were associated with musculoskeletal pain when 
the prevalence and prevalence ratio analyzes were performed. Higher prevalence 
of musculoskeletal symptoms in the lumbar region is with 17.9%. In the lower 
limbs, the most affected joint was the ankle (5.7%), followed by the hip (5.07%) 
and knee (5.07%), respectively. Insomnia was present in 55.35% and self-reported 
headache in 49.4% of participants.The musculoskeletal disorders generated by the 
daily service of motorcycle taxi drivers are directly affecting the quality of 
life of these professionals.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between patient-reported 
outcome measures (PROMs) six months following femoral neck fracture after a low 
fall and future arthroplasty, and the factors associated with this. Six-month 
post-fracture PROMs were collected from the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma 
Outcomes Registry (VOTOR) for patients aged >55 years who were admitted for a 
femoral neck fracture after a low fall between March 2007 and June 2015. These 
cases were linked with those registered by Australian Orthopaedic Association 
National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) up to October 2016. Multivariable 
analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model to determine 
factors associated with future arthroplasty, including six-month PROMs. Of the 
7077 hip fracture patients registered by VOTOR during the study period, 2325 met 
the inclusion criteria. Internal fixation being used for the initial hip 
fracture surgery, being younger and having no pre-injury disability were all 
independently associated with future revision or conversion to arthroplasty. Out 
of all PROMs, reporting pain and discomfort six months post-fracture was 
associated with a 9.5-fold increase in the risk of future arthroplasty (95% CI: 
3.81, 23.67). The value of clinical registries can be enhanced via data linkage, 
in this case by using PROMs to predict arthroplasty following femoral neck 
fracture.

As primary outcomes differ among clinical lumbar disc herniation (LDH) studies, 
this study aimed to explore outcomes reflecting real-world patient experiences 
through an exploratory questionnaire survey. Those diagnosed with LDH having 
radiating leg pain in South Korea in November of 2022 (N = 500) were 
administered a questionnaire including basic characteristics, disease onset, 
symptoms and severity, priority symptoms for improvement, and important 
treatment factors. Outcome measures included the identification of priority 
symptoms and disabilities. Most common symptoms were numbness in the leg (N = 
435, 87.0%) and back pain (N = 406, 81.2%); most common disabilities were 
discomfort in sitting (N = 323, 64.6%) and lifting (N = 318, 63.6%). The highest 
priority symptom was back pain (N = 242, 48.4%). A satisfactory degree of 
symptom improvement was a decrease of at least 3 points on the numeric rating 
scale. The majority of respondents preferred improvement in disability over pain 
(N = 270, 55.8%), a stable effect over a rapid effect (N = 391, 78.2%), and 
safety over treatment efficacy (N = 282, 56.4%). Safety (N = 129, 25.8%) and 
cost (N = 111, 22.2%) were the most important treatment factors. Improvements in 
back pain, leg pain, sitting, and sleeping were prioritized, and safety, stable 
treatment effect, and functional recovery were desired. Clinical trials for LDH 
should be designed to reflect this real-world patient need. Further study to 
examine the patients' symptoms and needs in details is needed.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of dynamic hip screw (DHS) and 
intralesional curettage via Watson-Jones approach in treatment of benign bone 
lesions of the proximal femur.
METHODS: Between March 2012 and December 2016, 20 patients (21 lesions) with 
benign bone tumors or tumor like conditions of proximal femurs were treated with 
DHS and intralesional curettage via Watson-Jones approach. Their average age was 
27.8 years (range, 11-51 years), including 13 males and 7 females. The 
pathological diagnosis were fibrous dysplasia in 11 cases, simple bone cyst in 2 
cases, aneurysmal bone cyst in 2 cases, benign fibrous histocytoma in 2 cases, 
giant cell tumor in 2 cases, and chondroblastoma in 1 case, including 3 
pathological fractures. According to the Enneking staging system, 18 patients 
were in stage S1, 3 patients with pathological fractures in stage S2. There was 
no varus deformity or valgus deformity. The operation time, intraoperative blood 
loss, and time of full weight-bearing were recorded. X-ray film and CT were used 
to observe the bone graft fusion and location of DHS. Complications were 
recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) 
scoring were used to evaluate function of lower limbs.
RESULTS: The average operation time was 177.1 minutes (range, 110-265 minutes). 
The average intraoperative blood loss was 828.6 mL (range, 200-2 300 mL). There 
was superficial incision infection in 1 case, deep incision infection in 1 case, 
and hip discomfort in 1 case, respectively. All patients were followed up 6-63 
months (mean, 27.4 months). The time of full weight-bearing was 2 days in 2 
patients with giant cell tumor and 2 to 13 weeks with an average of 7.2 weeks in 
the other patients. At last follow-up, VAS and MSTS were 0.19±0.51 and 
29.62±0.97 respectively, showing significant differences when compared with the 
values before operation (3.52±2.62 and 23.71±8.77) ( t=5.565, P=0.000; t=-3.020, 
P=0.007 ). X-ray film showed the all bone grafts fusion with mean time of 8.2 
months (range, 5-12 months). There was no pathological fracture of the femur, 
local tumor recurrence, chronic hip pain, dislocation, or femoral head necrosis 
during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of benign bone lesion of the proximal femur using DHS 
and intralesional curettage via Watson-Jones approach is a safe and effective 
method.

Morphea, also known as localized scleroderma, encompasses a group of idiopathic 
sclerotic skin diseases. The spectrum ranges from relatively mild phenotypes, 
which generally cause few problems besides local discomfort and visible 
disfigurement, to subtypes with severe complications such as joint contractures 
and limb length discrepancies. Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF, Shulman syndrome) is 
often regarded as belonging to the severe end of the morphea spectrum. The exact 
driving mechanisms behind morphea and EF pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. 
However, extensive extracellular matrix formation and autoimmune dysfunction are 
thought to be key pathogenic processes. Likewise, these processes are considered 
essential in systemic sclerosis (SSc) pathogenesis. In addition, similarities in 
clinical presentation between morphea and SSc have led to many theories about 
their relatedness. Importantly, morphea may be differentiated from SSc based on 
absence of sclerodactyly, Raynaud's phenomenon, and nailfold capillary changes. 
The diagnosis of morphea is often based on characteristic clinical findings. 
Histopathological evaluation of skin biopsies and laboratory tests are not 
necessary in the majority of morphea cases. However, full-thickness skin 
biopsies, containing fascia and muscle tissue, are required for the diagnosis of 
EF. Monitoring of disease activity and damage, especially of subcutaneous 
involvement, is one of the most challenging aspects of morphea care. Therefore, 
data harmonization is crucial for optimizing standard care and for comparability 
of study results. Recently, the localized scleroderma cutaneous assessment tool 
(LoSCAT) has been developed and validated for morphea. The LoSCAT is currently 
the most widely reported outcome measure for morphea. Care providers should take 
disease subtype, degree of activity, depth of involvement, and quality-of-life 
impairments into account when initiating treatment. In most patients with 
circumscribed superficial subtypes, treatment with topical therapies suffices. 
In more widespread disease, UVA1 phototherapy or systemic treatment with 
methotrexate (MTX), with or without a systemic corticosteroid combination, 
should be initiated. Disappointingly, few alternatives for MTX have been 
described and additional research is still needed to optimize treatment for 
these debilitating conditions. In this review, we present a state-of-the-art 
flow chart that guides care providers in the treatment of morphea and EF.

BACKGROUND: This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of 
the current prehabilitation and rehabilitation strategies for thyroid cancer 
survivors to optimize functional outcomes and enhance their quality of life.
METHODS: The review follows the SANRA quality criteria and includes an extensive 
literature search conducted in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus.
RESULTS: The review emphasizes the role of a comprehensive rehabilitation 
approach in targeting the different domains that generate disability in thyroid 
cancer patients. In this context, physical activity, range of motion exercises, 
myofascial release, joint mobilization, and postural exercises are crucial for 
improving functional outcomes and reducing treatment-related discomfort and 
disability. Moreover, tailored rehabilitative management addressing dysphonia 
and dysphagia might have a positive impact on the quality of life of these 
patients. Despite these considerations, several barriers still affect the 
implementation of a multimodal rehabilitative approach in common clinical 
practice. Thus, sustainable and effective strategies like digital innovation and 
patient-centered approaches are strongly needed in order to implement the 
rehabilitative treatment framework of these subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review provides valuable insights into the current 
prehabilitation and rehabilitation strategies to treat thyroid cancer survivors, 
addressing physical, psychological, and vocational needs to optimize functional 
outcomes and enhance their quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Disc herniation refers to the displacement of disc material beyond 
its anatomical space. Disc sequestration is defined as migration of the 
herniated disc fragment into the epidural space, completely separating it from 
the parent disc. The fragment can move in upward, inferior, and lateral 
directions, which often causes low back pain and discomfort, abnormal sensation, 
and movement of lower limbs. The free disc fragments detached from the parent 
disc often mimic spinal tumors. Tumor like lumbar disc herniation can cause 
clinical symptoms similar to spinal tumors, such as lumbar soreness, pain, 
numbness and weakness of lower limbs, radiation pain of lower limbs, etc. It is 
usually necessary to diagnose the disease according to the doctor's clinical 
experience, and make preliminary diagnosis and differential diagnosis with the 
help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI. However, 
pathological examination is the gold standard that distinguishes tumoral from 
non-tumoral status. We report four cases of disc herniation mimicking a tumor, 
and all the pathological results were intervertebral disc tissue.
CASE SUMMARY: The first case was a 71-year-old man with low back pain 
accompanied by left lower extremity radiating pain for 1 year, with exacerbation 
over the last 2 wk. After admission, MRI revealed a circular T2-hypointense 
lesion in the spinal canal of the L4 vertebral segment, with enhancement on 
contrast-enhanced MRI suggesting neurilemmoma. The second case was a 74-year-old 
man with pain in both knees associated with movement limitation for 3 years, 
with exacerbation over the last 3 mo. MRI revealed an oval T2-hyperintense 
lesion in the spinal canal at the L4-5 level, with obvious peripheral 
enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI. Thus, neurilemmoma was suspected. The 
third case was a 53-year-old man who presented with numbness and weakness of the 
lumbar spine and right lower extremity for 2 wk. MRI revealed a round 
T2-hyperintense lesion in the spinal canal at the L4-5 level, with obvious rim 
enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI. Thus, a spinal tumor was suspected. The 
fourth case was a 75-year-old man with right lower extremity pain for 2 wk, with 
exacerbation over the last week. MRI revealed a round T1-isointense lesion in 
the spinal canal of the L3 vertebral segment and a T2-hyperintense signal from 
the lesion. There was no obvious enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI, so a 
spinal tumor was suspected. All four patients underwent surgery and recovered to 
ASIA grade E on postoperative days 5, 8, 8, and 6, respectively. All patients 
had an uneventful postoperative course and fully recovered within 3 mo.
CONCLUSION: Disc herniation mimicking a tumor is a relatively rare clinical 
entity and can be easily misdiagnosed as a spinal tumor. Examinations and tests 
should be improved preoperatively. Patients should undergo comprehensive 
preoperative evaluations, and the lesions should be removed surgically and 
confirmed by pathological diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy in Western societies does not necessarily 
mean better quality of life. To improve resources management, management systems 
have been set up in health systems to stratify patients according to morbidity, 
such as Clinical Risk Groups (CRG). The main objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of multimorbidity on health-related quality of life (HRQL) 
in primary care.
METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study, based on a representative 
random sample (n = 306) of adults from a health district (N = 32,667) in east 
Spain (Valencian Community), was conducted in 2013. Multimorbidity was measured 
by stratifying the population with the CRG system into nine mean health statuses 
(MHS). HRQL was assessed by EQ-5D dimensions and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale 
(EQ VAS). The effect of the CRG system, age and gender on the utility value and 
VAS was analysed by multiple linear regression. A predictive analysis was run by 
binary logistic regression with all the sample groups classified according to 
the CRG system into the five HRQL dimensions by taking the "healthy" group as a 
reference. Multivariate logistic regression studied the joint influence of the 
nine CRG system MHS, age and gender on the five EQ-5D dimensions.
RESULTS: Of the 306 subjects, 165 were female (mean age of 53). The most 
affected dimension was pain/discomfort (53%), followed by anxiety/depression 
(42%). The EQ-5D utility value and EQ VAS progressively lowered for the MHS with 
higher morbidity, except for MHS 6, more affected in the five dimensions, save 
self-care, which exceeded MHS 7 patients who were older, and MHS 8 and 9 
patients, whose condition was more serious. The CRG system alone was the 
variable that best explained health problems in HRQL with 17%, which rose to 21% 
when associated with female gender. Age explained only 4%.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that the multimorbidity groups obtained by 
the CRG classification system can be used as an overall indicator of HRQL. These 
utility values can be employed for health policy decisions based on 
cost-effectiveness to estimate incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
with routinely e-health data. Patients under 65 years with multimorbidity 
perceived worse HRQL than older patients or disease severity. Knowledge of 
multimorbidity with a stronger impact can help primary healthcare doctors to pay 
attention to these population groups.

Despite the recognized benefits of sexual expression and its importance in the 
lives of people living with dementia, research demonstrates that there are 
multiple barriers to its positive expression (e.g., expression that is 
pleasurable and free of coercion, discrimination, and violence) in RLTC homes. 
These barriers constitute a form of discrimination based on age and ability, and 
violate the rights of persons living with dementia to dignity, autonomy, and 
participation in everyday life and society. Drawing on a human rights approach 
to dementia and sexual expression, we explored the experiences of diverse 
professionals, family members, and persons living with dementia with explicit 
attention to the ways in which macro-level dynamics are influencing the support, 
or lack thereof, for sexual expression at the micro level. Focus groups and 
in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 participants, and the collected data 
were analyzed thematically. While all participants acknowledged that intimacy 
and sexual expression of persons living with dementia should be supported, 
rarely is such expression supported in practice. Micro-level factors included 
negative attitudes of professionals toward sexual expression by persons living 
with dementia, their discomfort with facilitating intimacy and sexual expression 
in the context of their professional roles, their anxieties regarding potential 
negative reactions from family members, and concerns about sanctions for failing 
to prevent abuse. In our analysis, we importantly trace these micro-level 
factors to macro-level factors. The latter include the cultural stigma 
associated with dementia, ageism, ableism, and erotophobia, all of which are 
reproduced in, and reinforced by, professionals' education, as well as legal and 
professional standards that exclusively focus on managing and safeguarding 
residents from abuse. Our analysis demonstrates a complexity that has enormous 
potential to inform future research that is critically needed for the 
development of educational initiatives and to promote policy changes in this 
area.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the pain caused by the application of 
a tourniquet after exsanguination of the upper limb with that occurring after 
simple elevation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used 26 healthy volunteers (52 arms), each of whom 
acted as their own matched control. The primary outcome measure was the total 
pain experienced by each volunteer while the tourniquet was inflated for 20 
minutes. This was calculated as the area under the pain curve for each 
individual subject. Secondary outcomes were pain at each time point; the total 
pain experienced during the recovery phase; the ability to tolerate the 
tourniquet and the time for full recovery after deflation of the tourniquet.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the area under the pain curves in 
favour of exsanguination (mean difference 8.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0 
to 13.7, p = 0.004). There was no difference between the dominant and 
non-dominant arms (mean difference -0.2; 95% CI -23.2 to 22.8, p = 0.99). The 
area under both recovery curves were similar (mean difference 0.7; 95% CI -6.0 
to 4.6, p = 0.78). There was no statistical difference in recovery time, the 
actual mean difference being 30 seconds longer in the elevation group (p = 
0.06).
CONCLUSION: Many orthopaedic and plastic surgery procedures are done under local 
anaesthetic or regional block where a bloodless field and a motionless patient 
are essential. Optimising patient comfort during surgery with the tourniquet 
inflated is thus a priority. This study is useful in that it compares two common 
methods of preparation of the upper limb prior to tourniquet inflation and which 
have not previously been compared in this context. Following on the results of 
this study, we can confidently conclude that exsanguinating the upper limb 
before inflating a tourniquet is more comfortable than simply elevating the arm 
for patients undergoing a procedure under local or regional block, both during 
the procedure and in the recovery phase.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Exsanguination rather than elevation is recommended in order 
to minimise patient discomfort and optimise the surgical field.

BACKGROUND: Cervical drains have historically been used to avoid postoperative 
wound and respiratory complications such as excessive edema, hematoma, 
infection, re-intubation, delayed extubation, or respiratory distress. Recently, 
some surgeons have ceased using drains because they may prolong hospital stay, 
operative time, or patient discomfort. The objective of this retrospective 
case-control series is to investigate the effectiveness of postoperative drains 
following one- and two-level cervical fusions.
METHODS: A chart review was conducted at a single institution from 2010-2013. 
Outcome measures included operative time, hospital stay, estimated blood loss 
and incidence of wound complications (infection, hematoma, edema, and 
complications with wound healing or evacuation), respiratory complications 
(delayed extubation, re-intubation, and respiratory treatment), and overall 
complications (wound complications, respiratory complications, dysphagia, and 
other complications). Statistical analyses including independent samples t-test, 
chi-square, analysis of covariance, and linear regression were used to compare 
patients who received a postoperative drain to those who did not.
RESULTS: The study population included 39 patients who received a postoperative 
drain and 42 patients who did not. There were no differences in demographics 
between the two groups. Patients with drains showed increased operative time 
(100.1 vs 69.3 min, p < 0.001), hospital stay (38.9 vs. 31.7 hrs, p = 0.021), 
and blood loss (62.7 vs 29.1 mL, p < 0.001) compared to patients without drains. 
The frequency of wound complications, respiratory complications, and overall 
complications did not vary significantly between groups.
CONCLUSIONS/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Cervical drains may not be necessary for patients 
undergoing one- and two-level cervical fusion. While there were no differences 
in incidence of complications between groups, patients treated with drains had 
significantly longer operative time and length of hospital stay.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This could contribute to excessive costs for patients 
treated with drains, despite the lack of compelling evidence of the advantages 
of this treatment in the literature and in the current study.

AIMS: This study assesses patient barriers to successful telemedicine care in 
orthopaedic practices in a large academic practice in the COVID-19 era.
METHODS: In all, 381 patients scheduled for telemedicine visits with three 
orthopaedic surgeons in a large academic practice from 1 April 2020 to 12 June 
2020 were asked to participate in a telephone survey using a standardized 
Institutional Review Board-approved script. An unsuccessful telemedicine visit 
was defined as patient-reported difficulty of use or reported dissatisfaction 
with teleconferencing. Patient barriers were defined as explicitly reported 
barriers of unsatisfactory visit using a process-based satisfaction metric. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using analysis of variances (ANOVAs), ranked 
ANOVAs, post-hoc pairwise testing, and chi-squared independent analysis with 95% 
confidence interval.
RESULTS: The survey response rate was 39.9% (n = 152). The mean age of patients 
was 51.1 years (17 to 85), and 55 patients (38%) were male. Of 146 respondents 
with completion of survey, 27 (18.5%) reported a barrier to completing their 
telemedicine visit. The majority of patients were satisfied with using 
telemedicine for their orthopaedic appointment (88.8%), and found the experience 
to be easy (86.6%). Patient-reported barriers included lack of proper 
equipment/internet connection (n = 13; 8.6%), scheduling difficulty (n = 2; 
1.3%), difficulty following directions (n = 10; 6.6%), and patient-reported 
discomfort (n = 2; 1.3%). Barriers based on patient characteristics were age > 
61 years, non-English primary language, inexperience with video conferencing, 
and unwillingness to try telemedicine prior to COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: The barriers identified in this study could be used to screen 
patients who would potentially have an unsuccessful telemedicine visit, allowing 
practices to provide assistance to patients to reduce the risk of an 
unsuccessful visit. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(9):745-751.

BACKGROUND: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most research has focused 
on the acute phase of COVID-19, yet some people experience symptoms beyond, 
referred to as post COVID-19 conditions (PCC). However, evidence on PCC and its 
impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is still scarce. This study 
aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 and PCC on HRQoL.
METHODS: This is a longitudinal cohort study of the Belgian adult population 
with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 5,727 people were followed up 
between the time of their infection and three months later. HRQoL was measured 
with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire before and during the infection and three months 
later. Linear mixed regression models were built to assess the longitudinal 
association between participants' characteristics and the evolution of their 
HRQoL.
RESULTS: This study found a significant decline in HRQoL during the SARS-CoV-2 
infection in comparison to the situation before (β=-9.91, 95%CI=-10.13;-9.85), 
but no clinically important difference three months after the infection compared 
to the situation before, except among people reporting PCC (β=-11.15, 
95%CI=-11.72;-10.51). The main symptoms of PCC with a significant negative 
impact on the different dimensions of HRQoL were fatigue/exhaustion (21%), 
headache (11%), memory problems (10%), shortness of breath (9%), and joint (7%) 
or muscle pain (6%). The dimension of HRQoL most negatively affected by several 
PCC symptoms was pain/discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: With the growing number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, PCC and 
its impact on HRQoL are becoming important public health issues. To allow people 
with PCC to recover and to limit its detrimental impact on HRQoL, it is 
essential to manage its various heterogeneous symptoms using a multidisciplinary 
approach.

Dry eye disease (DED) impacts ≈30% of the world's population and causes serious 
ocular discomfort and even visual impairment. Inflammation is one core cause of 
the DED vicious cycle, a multifactorial deterioration in DED process. However, 
there are also reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating inflammation and other 
points in the cycle from the upstream, leading to treatment failure of current 
therapies merely targeting inflammation. Accordingly, the authors develop 
micelle-based eye drops (more specifically p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases 
(MAPK) inhibitor Losmapimod (Los)-loaded and ROS scavenger Tempo 
(Tem)-conjugated cationic polypeptide micelles, designated as MTem/Los) for safe 
and efficient DED management. Cationic MTem/Los improve ocular retention of 
conjugated water-soluble Tem and loaded water-insoluble Los via electrostatic 
interaction with negatively charged mucin on the cornea, enabling an increase in 
therapeutic efficiency and a decrease in dosing frequency. Mechanistically, 
MTem/Los effectively decrease ROS over-production, reduce the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, restrain macrophage proinflammatory 
phenotypic transformation, and inhibit cell apoptosis. Therapeutically, the 
dual-functional MTem/Los suppress the inflammatory response, reverse corneal 
epithelial defect, save goblet cell dysfunction, and recover tear secretion, 
thus breaking the vicious cycle and alleviating the DED. Moreover, MTem/Los 
exhibit excellent biocompatibility and tolerability for potential application as 
a simple and rapid treatment of oxidative stress- and inflammation-induced 
disorders, including DED.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on the quality of 
life (QoL) of survivors and their partners and family members.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cross-sectional global online survey using 
social media.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 and partners or family members (age ≥18 
years).
INTERVENTION: Online survey from June to August 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The EuroQol group five dimensions three level (EQ-5D-3L) 
to measure the QoL of survivors of COVID-19, and the Family Reported Outcome 
Measure (FROM-16) to assess the impact on their partner/family member's QoL.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 735 COVID-19 survivors (mean age=48 years; 
females=563) at a mean of 12.8 weeks after diagnosis and by 571 partners and 164 
family members (n=735; mean age=47 years; females=246) from Europe (50.6%), 
North America (38.5%) and rest of the world (10.9%). The EQ-5D mean score for 
COVID-19 survivors was 8.65 (SD=1.9, median=9; range=6-14). 81.1% (596/735) 
reported pain and discomfort, 79.5% (584/735) problems with usual activities, 
68.7% (505/735) anxiety and depression and 56.2% (413/735) problems with 
mobility. Hospitalised survivors (20.1%, n=148) and survivors with existing 
health conditions (30.9%, n=227) reported significantly more problems with 
mobility and usual activities (p<0.05), with hospitalised also experiencing more 
impact on self-care (p≤0.001). Among 735 partners and family members, the mean 
FROM-16 score (maximum score=highest impact =32) was 15 (median=15, range=0-32). 
93.6% (688/735) reported being worried, 81.7% (601/735) frustrated, 78.4% 
(676/735) sad, 83.3% (612/735) reported impact on their family activities, 68.9% 
(507/735) on sleep and 68.1% (500/735) on their sex life.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 survivors reported a major persisting impact on their 
physical and psychosocial health. The lives of their partners and other family 
members were also severely affected. There is a need for a holistic support 
system sensitive to the needs of COVID-19 survivors and their family members who 
experience a major 'secondary burden'.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the manifestation, mechanisms, and treatment of 
isolated partial femoral avulsion fractures of the posterior cruciate ligament 
(PCL) in adults.
METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2018, we retrospectively reviewed the 
clinical data of three patients with isolated partial femoral avulsion fractures 
of the PCL who were admitted to our institution. All of these patients were 
admitted to our emergency department within 24 h after injury. After physical 
examination and radiographs were taken and reviewed, all patients were admitted 
and underwent surgical treatment. In a 26-year-old man who underwent 
arthroscopic surgery through the traditional medial and lateral approach before 
finally converting to open surgery with the posterior approach, the fragment 
that was finally removed was partially attached to the PCL. In the other two 
patients, women aged 63 and 68 years, who underwent arthroscopic surgery via the 
traditional medial and lateral approach, the fragments were large and attached 
to most fibers of the PCL. We fixed the fragments using hollow screws in 
arthroscopic view. In addition, in the 63-year-old patient, an anchor was 
embedded to restore the tension of the PCL. Four weeks after surgery, the 
patients started to wear long leg braces in full extension with the tibia 
blocked up by cushion. Physical examinations were conducted and radiographs were 
taken preoperatively and at 4 weeks and 3 months after surgery to evaluate the 
condition of the injury. The range of motion and the Lysholm knee scoring scale 
for the knee joint were compared before and after the surgery.
RESULTS: For the three patients, the radiographs taken at 3 months 
postoperatively showed that the fixation of the screws did not fail, and the 
subchondral bone was generally normal compared to the preoperative radiographs. 
CT scanning at 3 months after surgery showed that the fracture healed in the 
original position of the avulsion site. For all patients, the affected knees 
presented as stable at physical examination 3 months after surgery; the Lachmann 
test and the anterior drawer test results were negative. In addition, the 
flexion-extension, internal rotation, and external rotation were approximately 
0°-130°, 0°-30°, and 0°-40° in the 26-year-old patient, respectively. The 
flexion-extension, internal rotation, and external rotation were approximately 
0°-100°, 0°-20°, and 0°-35° for the 63-year-old patient, respectively. The 
flexion-extension, internal rotation, and external rotation were approximately 
0°-100°, 0°-15°, and 0°-20° for the 68-year-old patient, respectively. There was 
no pain or only little pain 3 months after surgery. There was no swelling or 
discomfort at the 3-month follow up. The Lysholm knee scores of the 68-year-old, 
63-year-old, and 26-year-old patient were 80, 87, and 95 at 3 months after 
surgery, respectively, which were obviously improved postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: The manifestation of isolated partial femoral avulsion fractures of 
the PCL in adults is often related to the injury mechanism, and surgery is 
essential for the treatment of these patients. Most of these fractures can be 
repaired by arthroscopic surgery, but some have to be treated by open surgery.

BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used 
for the treatment of pain and fever associated with the common cold.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of NSAIDs versus placebo (and other 
treatments) on signs and symptoms of the common cold, and to determine any 
adverse effects of NSAIDs in people with the common cold.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 4, April), (January 1966 to 
April week 3, 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2015), CINAHL (January 1982 
to April 2015) and ProQuest Digital Dissertations (January 1938 to April 2015).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NSAIDS in adults or 
children with the common cold.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors extracted data. We subdivided 
trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs. We 
extracted and summarised data on global analgesic effects (such as reduction of 
headache and myalgia), non-analgesic effects (such as reduction of nasal 
symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing) and side effects. We expressed dichotomous 
outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous 
data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We pooled 
data using the fixed-effect and random-effects models.
MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with 1069 participants, describing 37 
comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. 
The overall risk of bias in the included studies was mixed. In a pooled 
analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD 
-0.40, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.24, three studies, random-effects model), or duration 
of colds (MD -0.23, 95% CI -1.75 to 1.29, two studies, random-effects model). 
For respiratory symptoms, cough did not improve (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.66 to 
0.56, two studies, random-effects model) but the sneezing score significantly 
improved (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.12, two studies, random-effects model). 
For outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and 
muscle and joint pain) the treatment produced significant benefits. The risk of 
adverse effects was not high with NSAIDs (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03, two 
studies, random-effects model) but it is difficult to conclude that such drugs 
are no different from placebo. The quality of the evidence may be estimated as 
'moderate' because of imprecision. The major limitations of this review are that 
the results of the studies are quite diverse and the number of studies for one 
result is quite small.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving the discomfort 
caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing 
respiratory symptoms. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered 
when using NSAIDs for colds.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) has a high clinical prevalence and 
frequently interferes with patients normal lives. In KOA patients, evidence 
suggests that intra-articular (IA) injection improves joint function and 
decreases discomfort. Several IA injection treatments are used in daily practice 
to improve symptomatic control of knee osteoarthritis, but their efficacy is 
frequently disputed.
METHODS: This network meta-analysis compares the efficacy of different IA 
injections for mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. Seven databases (PubMed, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc, WanFang, 
and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched for randomized 
controlled trials published up to and including December 20, 2021, and final 
follow up indicators were used. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score and The 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 
score change from baseline were the primary outcomes. We used the Cochrane risk 
of bias tool to assess the quality and risks of biases of papers. We calculated 
the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each 
outcome. State (Version 15.1, Texas, USA) and SPSS (Version 20, Chicago, USA) 
was used in all statistical analyses, and Review Manager (version 5.4) was used 
in assessing the risks of biases.
RESULTS: Our study included 16 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1652 
patients. platelet-rich plasma (PRP) IA injection therapy had the highest 
likelihood of being the best intervention in reducing WOMAC pain (surface under 
the cumulative ranking area [SUCRA] 84.7%), stiffness (SUCRA 95.1%), and 
function (SUCRA 98.5%) scores, according to the SUCRA. The best measures for 
lowering the WOMAC total and VAS scores were IA injection platelet-rich 
plasma-derived growth factor (SUCRA 84.9%) and hyaluronic acid and platelet-rich 
plasma (SUCRA 84.9%). In the VAS score group, PRP outperformed hyaluronic acid 
(HA) (WMD 1.3, 95% CI 0.55-2.55) and corticosteroids (CS) (WMD 4.85, 95% CI 
4.02-5.08), according to the forest map results. PRP also outperformed CS (WMD 
14.76, 95% CI 12.11-17.41), ozone (WMD 9.16, 95% CI 6.89-11.43), and PRP + HA 
(WMD 2.18, 95% CI 0.55-3.81) in the WOMAC total score group. Furthermore, PRP 
outperforms other drugs in terms of reducing WOMAC function, stiffness, and 
function score.
CONCLUSION: In patients with mild to moderate KOA, IA injection PRP outperformed 
IA injection ozone, HA, CS, platelet-rich plasma-derived growth factor, and 
hyaluronic acid and platelet-rich plasma in terms of pain, stiffness, and 
dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about how long-term weight gain affects the health 
perception of COPD patients.
OBJECTIVES: The aim is to evaluate the long-term association of BMI change and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in obese COPD patients.
METHODS: Claims and survey data from a COPD disease management program were used 
to match two groups of COPD patients with BMI ≥ 30 who have differing weight 
trajectories over a 5-year timespan via propensity score and genetic matching. 
EQ-5D-5L, including visual analog scale (VAS) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT), 
were used as outcomes of interest. Sociodemographic and disease-based variables 
were matched.
RESULTS: Out of 1202 obese COPD patients, 126 with a weight increase of four or 
more BMI points were matched separately with 252 (propensity score matching) and 
197 (genetic matching) control subjects who had relatively stable BMI. For the 
EQ-5D-5L, patients with BMI increase reported significantly worse health 
perception for VAS and all descriptive dimensions except pain/discomfort. For 
the CAT, especially the perception of ability to complete daily activities and 
overall energy results were significantly worse. VAS differences reach the range 
of minimal important differences. Stopping smoking and already being in obesity 
class II were the most influential risk factors for BMI increase.
CONCLUSION: Obese COPD patients who gain four or more BMI points over 5 years 
report significantly lower results in different dimensions of generic and 
disease-specific HRQoL than their peers with stable BMI. To improve real-world 
outcomes, tracking and preventing specific BMI trajectories could constitute a 
clinically relevant aspect of managing COPD patients.

BACKGROUND: Spinous process has been routinely resected during posterior fusion 
of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis for fusion bed preparation and local 
autologous bone graft supplement. However, spinous process serves as an 
important structure in posterior ligament complex and was the anchorage of 
paraspinal muscle groups. With the development of pedicle screws instrumentation 
and the potential fusion ability in children, the need for resecting spinous 
process in this procedure could be further investigated. The purpose of this 
study was to compare the fusion rates, surgical outcomes and complications 
between harvesting and preserving the spinous process in posterior fusion of 
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2008, 104 consecutive adolescent 
idiopathic scoliosis patients underwent primary posterior fusion with local 
autologous bone grafts and following for a minimum of 24 months were reviewed. 
The patients were divided into a harvesting group (n = 61) with the spinous 
process harvested, and a preserving group (n = 43) with the spinous process 
preserved. Blood loss, radiographic assessments, and clinical outcomes were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in duration of surgery and 
peri-operative blood transfusion between the two groups. However, blood loss was 
statistically greater (983 ± 446 ml vs. 824 ± 361 ml; p = 0.048) and duration of 
hospitalization was statistically longer (7.4 ± 1.0 days vs. 6.8 ± 0.8 days; 
p = 0.003) in the harvesting group. The pre- and post-operative structural 
curves, correction rates, sagittal profile and loss of corrections were similar 
in both groups. Based on radiographic evaluation, the incidences of 
pseudoarthrosis were similar in both groups (3/61 vs. 2/43; p = 0.95). The 
incidence of prescribing pain medication for back discomfort during follow-up 
was statistically higher in the harvesting group (16/61 vs. 4/43; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical outcomes and fusion rates between harvesting and 
preserving the spinous process were comparable. Resecting the spinous process as 
local autologous bone graft may not be necessary in posterior fusion for 
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients.

BACKGROUND: Presentation of musculoskeletal symptoms, such as pain, discomfort, 
or disability, caused by a traffic accident (TA) is a common occurrence. 
However, studies on treatment and management of sudden low back pain (LBP) 
caused by a TA are very scarce, while studies on the effectiveness of motion 
style acupuncture therapy (MSAT) used on such patients are also rare. 
Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is planned to assess the 
effectiveness and safety of MSAT using traction (T-MSAT) for the treatment of 
pain and functional problems in patients with acute LBP caused by a TA.
METHODS: This study will be conducted at Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine in 
South Korea, using a two-armed, parallel, assessor-blinded RCT design. The study 
population will consist of 100 participants who will be randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to either the T-MSAT+integrative Korean medicine therapy (IKMT) group 
or IKMT control group. The treatment will be applied continuously for 3 days 
after admission. The primary outcome will be the difference between the numeric 
rating scale (NRS) scores at admission and immediately after treatment on the 
fourth day of admission. Secondary outcomes will include visual analogue scale 
(VAS) for LBP and radiating leg pain; NRS for radiating leg pain; lumbar active 
range of motion; Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGIC); the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5-K); 
and 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12).
DISCUSSION: This study is a RCT to assess the effectiveness and safety of T-MSAT 
for acute LBP caused by a TA. The findings could be used by healthcare-related 
policy makers and clinicians in primary care institutions, which are frequently 
visited by patients suffering from LBP caused by a TA.

The extra-articular distal humerus locking plate (EADHP) is widely used for 
distal extra-articular diaphyseal humeral fracture fixation. However, it 
occasionally causes skin prominence and discomfort. The upside-down use of a 
proximal humerus internal locking system (PHILOS) plate is suggested as an 
alternative option, but it lacks biomechanical evidence. The purpose of this 
study was to compare the biomechanical performance between two different 
fixation methods: the modified use of the PHILOS plate on the anterior cortex 
versus conventional use of an EADHP on the posterior cortex. Twelve pairs of 
fresh-frozen cadaveric humeri were used and 7 mm gap osteotomy was performed at 
50 mm proximal to the lateral epicondyle to simulate an AO/OTA 12-C1.3 fracture 
type. Single load to failure was measured after five stiffness tests of the 
plate-bone constructs in anterior/posterior bending, internal/external torsion, 
and axial compression. There were no significant differences in metrics between 
the two groups, except for the load to failure in posterior bending, which was 
significantly higher for PHILOS (1589.3 ± 234.5) compared to EADHP 
(1430.1 ± 188.6), p < .023. In conclusion, the modified use of the PHILOS plate 
showed comparable biomechanical performance compared to the conventional EADHP. 
The new fixation method offers potential clinical advantages, considering the 
patient's position and surgical approach at the time of surgery as well as 
postoperative soft tissue irritation. Therefore, this could be an option for 
distal humeral extra-articular diaphyseal fracture fixation when the use of 
EADHP is not suitable or preferred.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Jun 06;(6):CD009363.

BACKGROUND: Clavicle fractures are common, accounting for 2.6% to 4% of all 
fractures. Eighty per cent of clavicle fractures are located in the middle third 
of the clavicle. Although treatment of these fractures is usually non-surgical, 
displaced clavicle fractures may be considered for surgical treatment because of 
their greater risk of non-union. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first 
published in 2013.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus 
conservative interventions for treating middle third clavicle fractures.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma 
Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, trials registries and 
reference lists updated to December 2017. We did not apply any language or 
publication restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised and quasi-randomised controlled 
trials evaluating surgical versus conservative interventions for treating 
fractures in the middle third of the clavicle. The primary outcomes were 
shoulder function or disability, pain and treatment failure, defined as the 
number of participants who had been given a non-routine secondary surgical 
intervention (excluding hardware removal), for symptomatic non-union, malunion 
or other complications.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors selected eligible 
studies, independently assessed risk of bias and cross-checked data. Where 
appropriate, we pooled results of comparable studies.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies involving 1469 participants with acute 
middle third clavicle fractures. All studies included adults, with the overall 
range from 17 to 70 years. Of the studies that reported gender, men were 
over-represented. Ten studies compared plate fixation with sling or 
figure-of-eight bandage, or both, and four studies compared intramedullary 
fixation with wearing either a sling or a figure-of-eight bandage. Almost all 
studies had design features that carry a high risk of bias, thus limiting the 
strength of their findings.Low-quality evidence from 10 studies (838 
participants), showed that, compared with conservative treatment, surgical 
treatment of acute middle third clavicle fractures may not improve upper arm 
function at follow-up of one year or longer: standardised mean difference (SMD) 
0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.67. We downgraded the quality of 
the evidence because of risk of bias and high statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 
83%). This corresponds to a mean improvement of 2.3 points in favour of surgery 
(0.14 points worse to 4.69 points better), on the 100-point Constant score; this 
does not represent a clinically important difference. There may be no difference 
in pain measured using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100 mm; higher scores mean 
worse pain) between treatments (mean difference (MD) -0.60 mm, 95% CI -3.51 to 
2.31; 277 participants, 3 studies; low-quality evidence reflecting risk of bias 
and imprecision). Surgery may reduce the risk of treatment failure, that is, 
number of participants who had non-routine secondary surgical intervention 
(excluding hardware removal), for symptomatic non-union, malunion or other 
complication (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.50; 1197 participants, 12 
studies; low-quality evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). The 
main source of treatment failure was mechanical failure (3.4%) in the surgery 
group and symptomatic non-union (11.6%) in the conservative-treatment group.We 
are uncertain whether surgery results in fewer people having one or more 
cosmetic problems, such as deformities, which were more common after 
conservative treatment, or hardware prominence or scarring, which only occurred 
in the surgery group (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.98; 1130 participants, 11 
studies; I2 = 63%; very low-quality evidence downgraded for risk of bias, 
imprecision and inconsistency). We are uncertain whether there is any difference 
between surgery and conservative treatment in the risk of incurring an adverse 
outcome that includes local infection, dehiscence, symptomatic malunion, 
discomfort leading to implant removal, skin and nerve problems: RR 1.34, 95% CI 
0.68 to 2.64; 1317 participants, 14 studies; I2 = 72%; very low-quality 
evidence, downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency). Hardware 
removal for discomfort was a common adverse outcome in the surgery group (10.2%) 
while symptomatic malunion was more common in the conservative-treatment group 
(11.3% versus 1.2% in the surgery group). Infection occurred only in the surgery 
group (3.2%). There may be no between-group difference in quality of life at one 
year (SF-12 or SF-36 physical component scores: 0 to 100 scale, where 100 is the 
best score): MD 0.30 (95% CI -1.95 to 2.56, 321 participants, 2 studies; 
low-quality evidence downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low-quality evidence that surgical treatment has 
no additional benefits in terms of function, pain and quality of life compared 
with conservative treatment, but may result in fewer treatment failures overall. 
Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain of the findings of a 
slightly better cosmetic result after surgery and of no difference between 
surgical and conservative treatment in the risk of adverse events. For both 
composite outcomes, there is a need to consider the balance of risks between the 
individual outcomes; for example, surgical adverse events, including wound 
infection or dehiscence and hardware irritation, against risk of adverse events 
that may be more commonly associated with conservative treatment such as 
symptomatic malunion and shoulder stiffness.Treatment options must be chosen on

Pain is a source of substantial discomfort. Abnormal activity in both the zona 
incerta (ZI) and posterior complex of the thalamus (Po) are implicated in 
neuropathic pain, but their exact roles remain unclear. In particular, the 
precise cell types and molecular mechanisms of the ZI-Po circuit that regulate 
nociception are largely uncharacterized. Here, we found that parvalbumin 
(PV)-positive neuronal projections from the ventral ZI (ZIv) to the Po (ZIv-Po) 
are critical for promoting nocifensive behaviors, whereas selectively inhibiting 
ZIv-Po activity reduces nocifensive withdrawal responses. Furthermore, 
cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed specifically at ZIv-Po axon 
terminals in this circuit, and cannabinoids attenuate nocifensive responses 
through presynaptic inhibition. Selective inhibition of the ZIv-Po circuit or 
administration of cannabinoids into the Po are sufficient to ameliorate 
pathological pain. These findings identify the critical role of the ZIv-Po 
circuit and its modulation by endocannabinoids in controlling nocifensive 
behaviors.

This study aimed to assess the costs, health status, and medical service 
satisfaction with Korean and conventional medicine use before and after surgery 
of patients visiting Korean medicine hospitals for postsurgical musculoskeletal 
pain. The study population comprised patients who visited KM hospitals for the 
first time between June and November 2017 for persistent or recurrent pain and 
discomfort after low back, neck, shoulder, or knee surgery. Various validated 
questionnaires were used to collect data. A total of 100 participants were 
enrolled, and the majority had undergone low back surgery (n = 82). The 
participants had received 1.3 ± 0.7 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
examinations and 2.4 ± 2.8 X-rays before surgery. Conventional interventions 
used before surgery were physical therapy (43%), medications (34%), and 
injections (28%), in descending order, while 48% of patients reported having 
received acupuncture 51.3 ± 81.1 times. The mean satisfaction score for surgery 
was 5.5 ± 2.8 points based on a 9-point Likert scale, while that for KM-based 
interventions was 6.3 ± 1.7 points. With respect to health-related information, 
the mean scores were 6.0 ± 2.2 points on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), 
0.6 ± 0.2 points on the 5-Level EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L), and 15.3 ± 10.2 
on Beck's Depression Index II (BDI-II). The mean score on the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) in patients with low back pain was 40.1 ± 19.2 points. 
Work impairment, as measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI-GH), was 62.5 ± 47.8%, while activity 
impairment was 5.9 ± 2.6%. Participants tended to show low satisfaction 
regarding surgery and high preference for KM-based interventions. In particular, 
low back surgery patients reported high ODI scores, indicating high 
dysfunctional levels and poor prognosis after surgery. It can be inferred that 
it is therefore important to provide appropriate presurgical and postsurgical 
care for patients with musculoskeletal pain to improve pain, function, and 
quality of life.

This study aims to describe the prevalence of spinal pain among Danish children, 
explore the differential nature of spinal pain, and investigate 
socio-demographic factors predisposing spinal pain. A descriptive study of 
46,726 11-14-year-olds participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort was 
conducted. Self-reported spinal pain (neck, middle back, and low back pain) was 
registered and classified according to severity. Socioeconomic data on children 
and their parents were identified in Statistics Denmark registers. Associations 
between socio-demographic factors and aspects of spinal pain were estimated 
using multinomial logistic regression models. To account for sample selection, 
inverse probability weighting (IPW) was applied. Almost 10% boys and 14% girls 
reported severe spinal pain, whereas around 30% of all children reported 
moderate pain. Effect estimates indicated the risk to increase with increasing 
age. Further, children without biological full siblings, not living with both of 
their parents, or children living in less-educated or lower-income families were 
more likely to experience spinal pain. The study conclusions were essentially 
unaffected by IPW.Conclusion: A considerable number of children suffer from 
spinal pain, and it is more common among children in more disadvantaged 
families. Etiology of spinal pain needs to be explored further with the aim of 
informing efficient and targeted prevention. What is Known: • Childhood spinal 
pain may cause marked discomfort and impairment in children's everyday life, and 
is suggested as important predictor of later-in-life spinal pain. • 
Methodological heterogeneity in previous studies and complexity of measuring 
pain make inferences at a broader level inadequate. What is New: • Prevalence of 
severe spinal pain in 11-14-year-olds was estimated to almost 10% for boys and 
14% for girls, and children in more disadvantaged families were more likely to 
experience spinal pain. • The results seemed unaffected by sample selection.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the disease characteristics of osteonecrosis of the 
femoral head (ONFH) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who 
experiencing prolonged glucocorticoid (GC) exposure.
METHODS: Between January 2016 and June 2019, 449 SLE patients meeting the 
criteria were recruited from multiple centers. Hip MRI examinations were 
performed during screening and regular follow-up to determine the occurrence of 
ONFH. The cohort was divided into ONFH and non-ONFH groups, and the differences 
in demographic baseline characteristics, general clinical characteristics, GC 
medication information, combined medication, and hip clinical features were 
compared and comprehensively described.
RESULTS: The age at SLE diagnosis was 29.8 (23.2, 40.9) years, with 93.1% (418 
cases) being female. The duration of GC exposure was 5.3 (2.0, 10.5) years, and 
the cumulative incidence of SLE-ONFH was 9.1%. Significant differences ( P<0.05) 
between ONFH and non-ONFH groups were observed in the following clinical 
characteristics: ① Demographic baseline characteristics: ONFH group had a higher 
proportion of patients with body mass index (BMI)<20 kg/m 2 compared to non-ONFH 
group. ② General clinical characteristics: ONFH group showed a higher proportion 
of patients with cutaneous and renal manifestations, positive antiphospholipid 
antibodies (aPLs) and anticardiolipin antibodies, severe SLE patients [baseline 
SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score ≥15], and secondary 
hypertension. Fasting blood glucose in ONFH group was also higher. ③ GC 
medication information: ONFH group had higher initial intravenous GC exposure 
rates, duration, cumulative doses, higher cumulative GC doses in the first month 
and the first 3 months, higher average daily doses in the first 3 months, and 
higher proportions of average daily doses ≥15.0 mg/d and ≥30.0 mg/d, as well as 
higher full-course average daily doses and proportion of full-course daily doses 
≥30.0 mg/d compared to non-ONFH group. ④ Combined medications: ONFH group had a 
significantly higher rate of antiplatelet drug use than non-ONFH group. ⑤ Hip 
clinical features: ONFH group had a higher proportion of hip discomfort or pain 
and a higher incidence of hip joint effusion before MRI screening than non-ONFH 
group.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of ONFH after GC exposure in China's SLE population 
remains high (9.1%), with short-term (first 3 months), medium-to-high dose 
(average daily dose ≥15 mg/d) GC being closely associated with ONFH. Severe SLE, 
low BMI, certain clinical phenotypes, positive aPLs, and secondary hypertension 
may also be related to ONFH.

Publisher: 目的: 描述系统性红斑狼疮（systemic lupus 
erythematosus，SLE）患者长期糖皮质激素（glucocorticoid，GC）暴露发生股骨头坏死（osteonecrosis of the 
femoral head，ONFH）的患病特征。.
方法: 
2016年1月—2019年6月，由多中心招募符合标准的449例SLE患者作为研究对象，分别在筛选入组及定期随访观察时进行髋关节MRI检查，判断是否出现ONFH。将队列人群分为ONFH组和非ONFH组，比较两组之间人口学基线特征、一般临床特征、GC用药信息、合并用药情况及髋部临床特征的差异，作综合性描述。.
结果: 
患者确诊SLE时年龄为29.8（23.2，40.9）岁，女性占93.1%（418例），GC暴露时间为5.3（2.0，10.5）年，SLE-ONFH累计新发病率为9.1%。ONFH和非ONFH两组以下临床特征差异有统计学意义（ 
P<0.05）：① 人口学基线特征：ONFH组身体质量指数（body mass index，BMI）<20 kg/m 2患者比例大于非ONFH组。② 
一般临床特征：ONFH组皮肤黏膜型和肾型患者比例，空腹血糖、任一抗磷脂抗体（antiphospholipid 
antibodies，aPLs）阳性及抗心磷脂抗体阳性比例，重症SLE患者 
［基线SLE活动指数2000（SLEDAI-2K）评分≥15分］比例，以及继发动脉性高血压比例均明显高于非ONFH组。③ 
GC用药信息：ONFH组较非ONFH组有更高的初始阶段静脉GC暴露比例、持续时间、累计剂量，更高的首月及前3个月GC累计剂量、前3个月日均剂量及前3个月日均剂量≥15.0 
mg/d、≥30.0 mg/d比例，以及更高的全程日均剂量和全程日均剂量≥30.0 mg/d比例。④ 
合并用药情况：ONFH组抗血小板药应用率显著高于非ONFH组。⑤ 
髋部临床特征：ONFH组MRI筛查前已出现髋部不适或疼痛发生比例、髋关节腔积液发生率均明显高于非ONFH组。.
结论: 目前国内SLE人群GC暴露后ONFH发生率仍较高（9.1%），其中短时间（前3个月）中高剂量（日均剂量≥15 
mg/d）GC与ONFH密切关联，而重症SLE、低BMI、部分临床表型、aPLs阳性及继发动脉性高血压等因素可能与ONFH相关。.

OBJECTIVES: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for treatment of 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were evaluated in 
patients with PsA with inadequate responses to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors 
(TNFi-IR) in a 6-month, phase III randomised controlled trial (OPAL Beyond 
[NCT01882439]).
METHODS: Patients (N=394) received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo 
(advancing to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily at month 3). Least squares mean 
changes from baseline and percentages of patients reporting improvements 
≥minimum clinically important differences and scores ≥normative values were 
determined in Patient Global Assessment of disease activity (PtGA), Pain, 
Patient Global Joint and Skin Assessment (PGJS), Short Form-36 Health Survey 
version 2 (SF-36v2), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue 
(FACIT-Fatigue), EuroQol 5-Dimensions-3-level (EQ-5D-3L), EQ-VAS and Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL). Nominal p values are without multiple 
comparison adjustments.
RESULTS: At month 3, PtGA, Pain, PGJS, SF-36v2 Physical Component Summary (PCS), 
physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), vitality and social functioning 
(SF) domains, FACIT-Fatigue Total score, EQ-5D-3L pain/discomfort, EQ-VAS and 
ASQoL scores exceeded placebo with both tofacitinib doses (role physical [RP] 
with 10 mg twice daily only; p≤0.05). Patients reporting improvements ≥MCID (%) 
in PtGA, PGJS, Pain, ASQoL and SF-36v2 PCS, PF, RP, BP, SF (both tofacitinib 
doses) exceeded placebo (p≤0.05).
CONCLUSION: TNFi-IR patients with PsA receiving tofacitinib reported 
statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in PROs versus placebo over 
3 months, which were maintained to month 6. Despite lower baseline scores, these 
improvements were similar to the csDMARD-IR TNFi-naive OPAL Broaden trial.

INTRODUCTION: Clinically, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) patients were 
suffered from dry eye syndrome. Only a few relevant studies were about this 
topic. Our study was determined to provide high-level evidence for the treatment 
of TAO with dry eye syndrome.
PURPOSE: To compare the clinical effects of vitamin A palmitate eye gel and 
sodium hyaluronate eye drop forTAO patients with dry eye syndrome.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Ophthalmology Department of the Ninth 
People's Hospital Affiliated with the Medical College of Shanghai Jiao Tong 
University from May to October 2020. A total of 80 mild or moderate-to-severe 
TAO patients with dry eye syndrome were randomly divided into two groups. The 
disease stages of all subjects were inactive. Patients in group A were treated 
with vitamin A palmitate eye gel three times/day for one month and sodium 
hyaluronate eye drop in group B. The index including break-up time (BUT) and 
Schirmer I test (ST), corneal fluorescence staining (FL), ocular surface disease 
index (OSDI), and adverse reactions were recorded by the same clinician at 
baseline and 1 month after treatment. The data were analyzed by SPSS 24.0.
RESULTS: Finally, 65 subjects completed the treatment. The average age of the 
patients in Group A was 38.1 ± 11.4 years, and that in Group B was 
37.26 ± 10.67 years. 82% of the subjects in group A were female and 74% in group 
B. There was no significant difference between the two groups at baseline, 
including the value of ST, BUT, OSDI, and FL grade. After the treatment, the 
effective rate was 91.2% in group A, of which the value of BUT and FL grade was 
significantly improved (P < 0.001). The effective rate in group B was 67.7%, of 
which the value of OSDI score and FL grade was significantly improved 
(P = 0.002). In addition, the BUT value of group A was significantly longer than 
that of group B (P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: InTAO patients with dry eye syndrome, vitamin A palmitate gel and 
sodium hyaluronate eye drop improved the dry eye and promoted corneal epithelial 
repair. Vitamin A palmitate gel improves the stability of tear film, while 
sodium hyaluronate eye drop improves patients' subjective discomfort.

Vestibulodynia (VBD), an idiopathic pain disorder characterized by erythema and 
pain of the vulvar vestibule (the inner aspect of the labia minora and vaginal 
opening), is the most common cause of sexual pain for women of reproductive age. 
Women also feel discomfort with contact with clothing and tampon use. As most 
women with this disorder only have pain with provocation of the tissue, topical 
anesthetics applied to the vestibule are the current first line treatment for 
temporary pain relief. Treatment options are limited due to anatomical 
constraints of the vestibular region, poor drug retention time, imprecise 
dosing, leakage, and overall product messiness. In this study we report a novel 
approach to treatment of VBD using thin film designed to fit the vulvar 
vestibule and deliver lidocaine locally. Two use cases for VBD treatment were 
identified 1) rapid drug release (<5 min), for use prior to intercourse and 2) 
long-acting release (≥120 min) for prolonged use and relief throughout the day. 
Cellulose-based mucoadhesive thin films were fabricated using a solvent casting 
method. Three polymers including hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), 
hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), and hydroxypropylmethycellulose (HMPC), were 
selected owing to their biocompatibility and ideal properties for film casting. 
Films casted with HEC, HPC, and HPMC exhibited mucoadhesive properties relative 
to a control, with the highest mucoadhesive force recorded for films casted with 
HPC. Effect of media volume, pH, presence of mucin and presence of drug on film 
dissolution rates were investigated. Dissolution rates were independent of media 
volume, media pH or drug presence, whereas faster dissolution rates were 
obtained for all films in presence of mucin. In vitro lidocaine release kinetics 
were influenced by polymer type, percent drug loading and film casting 
thickness. Lidocaine release was based on a diffusion mechanism rather than 
through film dissolution and faster release (∼5 min) was observed for HEC films 
compared HPC films (∼120 min). Higher drug loading and film thickness resulted 
in slower and more prolonged release kinetics of lidocaine. All films were 
biocompatible and exhibited good mechanical properties. Two film formulations 
(9% w/w HPC with 12% w/w LHC, 5% w/w HEC with 6% w/w LHC) were optimized to meet 
the two use case scenarios for VBD treatment and moved into in vivo testing. In 
vivo testing demonstrated the safety of the films in BALB/c mice, and the 
pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated the delivery of lidocaine primarily to the

Allergic and immunologic skin diseases negatively impact the quality of life 
(QoL) of affected patients with detrimental consequences. Nonetheless, in 
everyday clinical practice the evaluation of QoL is often overlooked. 
Considering the increasing prevalence of atopic dermatitis, allergic contact 
dermatitis, hereditary angioedema, cutaneous mastocytosis, and urticaria, it is 
essential to determine the effects of allergic and immunologic skin diseases on 
QoL. A joint meeting (GET TOGETHER 2021) of the Italian Society of Allergology, 
Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC) and the Italian Society of 
Allergological, Occupational and Environmental Dermatology (SIDAPA) aimed to 
summarize the features of the main QoL tools used in these diseases and to 
describe the extent of QoL impairment as well as the impact of treatments on 
QoL, particularly biologic therapies. The assessment of QoL in patients with 
allergic and immunologic skin diseases relies on generic, organ-specific and 
disease-specific questionnaires. While generic and organ-specific questionnaires 
allow comparison between different diseases, disease-specific questionnaires are 
designed and validated for specific cohorts: the QoL Index for Atopic Dermatitis 
(QoLIAD) and the Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale (CADIS) in atopic 
dermatitis, the ACD-11 in allergic contact dermatitis, the Angioedema QoL 
Questionnaire (AE-QoL) and the Hereditary Angioedema QoL questionnaire (HAE-QoL) 
in hereditary angioedema, the Mastocytosis QoL Questionnaires (MCQoL e MQLQ) in 
cutaneous mastocytosis, and the Chronic Urticaria QoL questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) in 
urticaria. Among the many factors that variably contribute to QoL impairment, 
pruritus can represent the leading cause of patient discomfort. Biologic 
therapies significantly ameliorate QoL in atopic dermatitis, hereditary 
angioedema, mastocytosis and chronic urticaria. In general, adequate management 
strategies are essential for improving QoL in patients with allergic and 
immunologic skin diseases.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence from animal and human studies that 
bimodal neuromodulation combining sound and electrical somatosensory stimulation 
of the tongue can induce extensive brain changes and treat tinnitus.
OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of the proposed clinical study are to confirm the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment demonstrated in a previous 
large-scale study of bimodal auditory and trigeminal nerve (tongue) stimulation 
(Treatment Evaluation of Neuromodulation for Tinnitus - Stage A1); evaluate the 
therapeutic effects of adjusting stimulation parameters over time; and determine 
the contribution of different features of bimodal stimulation in improving 
tinnitus outcomes.
METHODS: This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-arm, comparative clinical trial of a 12-week treatment for tinnitus 
using a Conformité Européenne (CE)-marked device with a pre-post and 12-month 
follow-up design. Four treatment arms will be investigated, in which each arm 
consists of two different stimulation settings, with the first setting presented 
during the first 6 weeks and the second setting presented during the next 6 
weeks of treatment. The study will enroll 192 participants, split in a ratio of 
80:80:16:16 across the four arms. Participants will be randomized to one of four 
arms and stratified to minimize baseline variability in four categories: two 
separate strata for sound level tolerance (using loudness discomfort level as 
indicators for hyperacusis severity), high tinnitus symptom severity based on 
the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), and tinnitus laterality. The primary 
efficacy endpoints are within-arm changes in THI and Tinnitus Functional Index 
as well as between-arm changes in THI after 6 weeks of treatment for the full 
cohort and two subgroups of tinnitus participants (ie, one hyperacusis subgroup 
and a high tinnitus symptom severity subgroup). Additional efficacy endpoints 
include within-arm or between-arm changes in THI after 6 or 12 weeks of 
treatment and in different subgroups of tinnitus participants as well as at 
posttreatment assessments at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Treatment safety, 
attrition rates, and compliance rates will also be assessed and reported.
RESULTS: This study protocol was approved by the Tallaght University 
Hospital/St. James's Hospital Joint Research Ethics Committee in Dublin, 
Ireland. The first participant was enrolled on March 20, 2018. The data 
collection and database lock are expected to be completed by February 2020, and 
the data analysis and manuscript submission are expected to be conducted in 
autumn of 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study will be disseminated to relevant 
research, clinical, and health services and patient communities through 
publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific and 
clinical conferences.

BACKGROUND: Ear wax (cerumen) is a normal bodily secretion that can become a 
problem when it obstructs the ear canal. Symptoms attributed to wax (such as 
deafness and pain) are among the commonest reasons for patients to present to 
primary care with ear trouble.Wax is part of the ear's self-cleaning mechanism 
and is usually naturally expelled from the ear canal without causing problems. 
When this mechanism fails, wax is retained in the canal and may become impacted; 
interventions to encourage its removal may then be needed. Application of ear 
drops is one of these methods. Liquids used to remove and soften wax are of 
several kinds: oil-based compounds (e.g. olive or almond oil); water-based 
compounds (e.g. sodium bicarbonate or water itself); a combination of the above 
or non-water, non-oil-based solutions, such as carbamide peroxide (a hydrogen 
peroxide-urea compound) and glycerol.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of ear drops (or sprays) to remove or aid the 
removal of ear wax in adults and children.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Register 
of Studies; PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; 
ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of 
the most recent search was 23 March 2018.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which a 
'cerumenolytic' was compared with no treatment, water or saline, an alternative 
liquid treatment (oil or almond oil) or another 'cerumenolytic' in adults or 
children with obstructing or impacted ear wax.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures 
expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were 1) the proportion of patients 
(or ears) with complete clearance of ear wax and 2) adverse effects (discomfort, 
irritation or pain). Secondary outcomes were: extent of wax clearance; 
proportion of people (or ears) with relief of symptoms due to wax; proportion of 
people (or ears) requiring further intervention to remove wax; success of 
mechanical removal of residual wax following treatment; any other adverse 
effects recorded and cost. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence 
for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies, with 623 participants (900 ears). 
Interventions included: oil-based treatments (triethanolamine polypeptide, 
almond oil, benzocaine, chlorobutanol), water-based treatments (docusate sodium, 
carbamide peroxide, phenazone, choline salicylate, urea peroxide, potassium 
carbonate), other active comparators (e.g. saline or water alone) and no 
treatment. Nine of the studies were more than 15 years old.The overall risk of 
bias across the 10 included studies was low or unclear.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: proportion of patients (or ears) with complete clearance of ear 
waxSix studies (360 participants; 491 ears) contributed quantitative data and 
were included in our meta-analyses.Active treatment versus no treatmentOnly one 
study addressed this comparison. The proportion of ears with complete clearance 
of ear wax was higher in the active treatment group (22%) compared with the no 
treatment group (5%) after five days of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 4.09, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 16.80); one study; 117 ears; NNTB = 8) 
(low-quality evidence).Active treatment versus water or salineWe found no 
evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients (or ears) with complete 
clearance of ear wax when the active treatment group was compared to the water 
or saline group (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.75; three studies; 213 participants; 
257 ears) (low-quality evidence). Two studies applied drops for five days, but 
one study only applied the drops for 15 minutes. When we excluded this study in 
a sensitivity analysis it did not change the result.Water or saline versus no 
treatmentThis comparison was only addressed in the single study cited above 
(active versus no treatment) and there was no evidence of a difference in the 
proportion of ears with complete wax clearance when comparing water or saline 
with no treatment after five days of treatment (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 17.62; 
one study; 76 ears) (low-quality evidence).Active treatment A versus active 
treatment BSeveral single studies evaluated 'head-to-head' comparisons between 
two active treatments. We found no evidence to show that one was superior to any 
other.Subgroup analysis of oil-based active treatments versus non-oil based 
active treatmentsWe found no evidence of a difference in this outcome when 
oil-based treatments were compared with non-oil-based active treatments.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: adverse effects: discomfort, irritation or painOnly seven 
studies planned to measure and did report this outcome. Only two (141 
participants;176 ears) provided useable data. There was no evidence of a 
significant difference in the number of adverse effects between the types of ear 
drops in these two studies. We summarised the remaining five studies 
narratively. All events were mild and reported in fewer than 30 participants 
across the seven studies (low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomesThree studies 
reported 'other' adverse effects (how many studies planned to report these is 
unclear). The available information was limited and included occasional reports 
of dizziness, unpleasant smell, tinnitus and hearing loss. No significant 
differences between groups were reported. There were no emergencies or serious 
adverse effects reported in any of the 10 studies.There was very limited or no 
information available on our remaining secondary outcomes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although a number of studies aimed to evaluate whether or 
not one type of cerumenolytic is more effective than another, there is no 
high-quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer 
remains uncertain.A single study suggests that applying ear drops for five days 
may result in a greater likelihood of complete wax clearance than no treatment 
at all. However, we cannot conclude whether one type of active treatment is more 
effective than another and there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy 
between oil-based and water-based active treatments.There is no evidence to show 
that using saline or water alone is better or worse than commercially produced 
cerumenolytics. Equally, there is also no evidence to show that using saline or 
water alone is better than no treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The majority of breast cancer patients from India usually present 
with advanced disease, limiting the scope of breast conservation surgery. 
Therapeutic mammoplasty (TM), an oncoplastic technique that permits larger 
excisions, is quite promising in such a scenario and well suited to breast 
cancer in medium-to-large-sized breasts with ptosis and in some cases of large 
or multifocal/multicentric tumors. Here, we describe our TM cohort of 205 (194 
malignant and 11 benign) patients from 2012 to 2019 treated at a single surgeon 
center in India, the largest Asian dataset for TM.
METHODS: All patients underwent treatment after careful discussions by a 
multidisciplinary tumor board and patient counseling. We report the 
clinicopathological profiles and surgical, oncological, cosmetic, and 
patient-related outcomes with different TM procedures.
RESULTS: The median age of breast cancer patients was 49 years; that of benign 
disease patients was 41 years. The breast cancer cohort underwent simple (n = 
84), complex (n = 71), or extreme (n = 44) TM surgeries. All resection margins 
were analyzed through intra-operative frozen-section assessment with stringent 
rad-path analysis protocols. The margin positivity rate was found to be 1.4%. A 
majority of the cohort was observed to have pT1-pT2 tumors, and the median 
resection volume was 180 cc. Low post-operative complication rates and 
good-to-excellent cosmetic scores were observed. The median follow-up was 39 
months. We observed 2.07% local and 5.7% distal recurrences, and 
disease-specific mortality was 3.1%. At median follow-up, the overall survival 
was observed to be 95.9%, and disease-free survival was found to be 92.2%. The 
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) showed good-to-excellent scores for 
all types of TMs across BREAST-Q domains.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that in India, a country where women present with large 
and locally advanced tumors, TM safely expands the indications for breast 
conservation surgery. Our results show oncological and cosmetic outcomes at 
acceptable levels. Most importantly, PROM scores suggest improved overall 
wellbeing and better satisfaction with the quality of life. For patients with 
macromastia, this technique not only focuses on cancer but also improves 
self-image and reduces associated physical discomfort often overlooked by women 
in the Indian setting. The popularization of this procedure will enable Indian 
patients with breast cancer to receive the benefits of breast conservation.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Patients with spinal metastases always have a poor 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease- and treatment-related 
adverse outcomes. The Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes Questionnaire (SOSGOQ) 
has been verified and validated in English for patients with spinal metastases 
but not in Chinese.
PURPOSE: This paper aimed to complete the cross-cultural adaptation of the 
Chinese version of the SOSGOQ, to verify its reliability and validity, and to 
report on the HRQoL of Chinese patients with spinal metastases.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a single-center, prospective, observational 
cross-sectional study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Seventy-six patients were enrolled in this study.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The SOSGOQ is made up of five HRQoL domains (physical 
function, neurological function, pain, mental health, social function) and 
post-therapy questions. The EQ-5D 3L questionnaire covers five items in 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain discomfort, and anxiety-depression, 
each with three answer options. The SF-36 comprises 36 items divided into eight 
domains.
METHODS: A single-center, prospective, observational cross-sectional study 
involving patients with spinal metastases who underwent surgery was conducted. 
HRQoL was evaluated using the Chinese version of the SOSGOQ, the Medical 
Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and the 
EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D). Demographic, tumor, symptom, and 
treatment data, as well as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
information, were collected. Internal consistency reliability, convergent 
validity, concurrent validity, and clinical validity were used to evaluate 
reliability. A Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the 
relationship between variables.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 76 patients, with a mean age of 55.8 years. The 
kidney was the most common primary tumor site, and the thoracic spine was the 
most affected. The internal consistency of the overall SOSQOQ (0.907) was higher 
than the EQ-5D (0.819), and all items of the SOSQOQ had a high convergent 
validity (>0.40). The SOSGOQ was significantly correlated with the EQ-5D in 
respective domains (p < 0.001) and overall score (p < 0.001), whereas the SF-36 
was related to the overall SOSGOQ score and most domains. Total SOSGOG was 
significantly sensitive to changes in ECOG (p = 0.017), prior surgery (p = 
0.001), and tumor type (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: The SOSGOQ is a reliable and effective tool for evaluating HRQoL in 
patients with spinal metastases, with high sensitivity and specificity. Surgical 
treatment can significantly improve patients' HRQoL.

This study investigates the role of Sygen® in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a 
severe disease that affects the peripheral nervous system in diabetic 
individuals. This disorder often impacts the lower limbs, causing significant 
discomfort and, if left untreated, progresses into more serious conditions 
involving chronic ulcers and even amputation in many cases. Although there are 
management strategies available, peripheral neuropathies are difficult to treat 
as they often present multiple causes, especially due to metabolic dysfunction 
in diabetic individuals. Gangliosides, however, have long been studied and 
appreciated for their role in neurological diseases. The 
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) ganglioside, popularly known as Sygen, 
provides beneficial effects such as enhanced neuritic sprouting, neurotrophism, 
neuroprotection, anti-apoptosis, and anti-excitotoxic activity, being 
particularly useful in the treatment of neurological complications that arise 
from diabetes. This product mimics the roles displayed by neurotrophins, 
improving neuronal function and immunomodulation by attenuating exacerbated 
inflammation in neurons. Furthermore, Sygen assists in axonal stabilization and 
keeps nodal and paranodal regions of myelin fibers organized. This maintains an 
adequate propagation of action potentials and restores standard peripheral nerve 
function. Given the multifactorial nature of this complicated disorder, medical 
practitioners must carefully screen the patient to avoid confusion and 
misdiagnosis. There are several studies analyzing the role of Sygen in 
neurological disorders. However, the medical literature still needs more robust 
investigations such as randomized clinical trials regarding the administration 
of this compound for diabetic peripheral neuropathies, specifically.

To investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older adults (aged ≥ 60 
years) after tibial plateau fracture (TPF) compared to preinjury and population 
matched values, and what aspects of treatment were most important to patients. 
We undertook a retrospective, case-control study of 67 patients at mean 3.5 
years (SD 1.3; 1.3 to 6.1) after TPF (47 patients underwent fixation, and 20 
nonoperative management). Patients completed EuroQol five-dimension three-level 
(EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire, Lower Limb Function Scale (LEFS), and Oxford Knee 
Scores (OKS) for current and recalled prefracture status. Propensity score 
matching for age, sex, and deprivation in a 1:5 ratio was performed using 
patient level data from the Health Survey for England to obtain a control group 
for HRQoL comparison. The primary outcome was the difference in actual (TPF 
cohort) and expected (matched control) EQ-5D-3L score after TPF. TPF patients 
had a significantly worse EQ-5D-3L utility (mean difference (MD) 0.09, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.16; p < 0.001) following their injury 
compared to matched controls, and had a significant deterioration (MD 0.140, 95% 
CI 0 to 0.309; p < 0.001) relative to their preoperative status. TPF patients 
had significantly greater pre-fracture EQ-5D-3L scores compared to controls (p = 
0.003), specifically in mobility and pain/discomfort domains. A decline in 
EQ-5D-3L greater than the minimal important change of 0.105 was present in 36/67 
TPF patients (53.7%). Following TPF, OKS (MD -7; interquartile range (IQR) -1 to 
-15) and LEFS (MD -10; IQR -2 to -26) declined significantly (p < 0.001) from 
pre-fracture levels. Of the 12 elements of fracture care assessed, the most 
important to patients were getting back to their own home, having a stable knee, 
and returning to normal function. TPFs in older adults were associated with a 
clinically significant deterioration in HRQoL compared to preinjury level and 
age, sex, and deprivation matched controls for both undisplaced fractures 
managed nonoperatively and displaced or unstable fractures managed with internal 
fixation.

BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as 
chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial 
infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid 
cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic 
membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. 
Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, act to kill or inhibit 
the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. 
Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such 
as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for 
people with CSOM.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane 
ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane 
Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; 
ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished 
trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at 
least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had 
chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had 
continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or 
combination of, topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class, applied directly into 
the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural 
toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared 
to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical 
antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B). Within each comparison we separated 
studies where both groups of participants had received topical antibiotic a) 
alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of background treatment (such as 
systemic antibiotics).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard Cochrane methodological 
procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each 
outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' 
(whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to 
two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related 
quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort 
or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications 
and ototoxicity measured in several ways.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 studies with a total of 2198 participants. Twelve 
studies reported the sample size in terms of participants (not ears); these had 
a total of 1797 participants. The remaining five studies reported both the 
number of participants and ears, representing 401 participants, or 510 ears. A: 
Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both 
arms and no other background treatment) One small study compared a topical 
antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received 
aural toilet. Although ciprofloxacin was better than saline in terms of 
resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 84% versus 12% (risk ratio (RR) 
6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants, very 
low-certainty evidence), the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is 
very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the 
other. The study authors reported that "no medical side-effects and worsening of 
audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected" 
(very low-certainty evidence). B: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no 
treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies compared 
topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (three studies; 190 participants) or 
topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (one study; 248 participants). In each study 
all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin, 
injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study all participants received aural 
toilet. Useable data were only available from the first three studies; 
ciprofloxacin was better than no treatment, resolution of discharge occurring in 
88.2% versus 60% at one to two weeks (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.80; 2 studies, 
150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported ear pain 
or discomfort/local irritation. C: Comparisons of different topical antibiotics 
The certainty of evidence for all outcomes in these comparisons is very low. 
Quinolones versus aminoglycosides Seven studies compared an aminoglycoside 
(gentamicin, neomycin or tobramycin) with ciprofloxacin (734 participants) or 
ofloxacin (214 participants). Whilst resolution of discharge at one to two weeks 
was higher in the quinolones group the very low certainty of the evidence means 
that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse 
than the other (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.29; 6 studies, 694 participants). One 
study measured ear pain and reported no difference between the groups. 
Quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B combination ±gramicidin We 
identified three studies but data on our primary outcome were only available in 
one study. Comparing ciprofloxacin to a neomycin/polymyxin B/gramicidin 
combination, for an unknown treatment duration (likely four weeks), 
ciprofloxacin was better (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, 186 participants). A 
"few" patients experienced local irritation upon the first instillation of 
topical treatment (numbers/groups not stated). Others Other studies examined 
topical gentamicin versus a trimethoprim/sulphacetamide/polymixin B combination 
(91 participants) and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol (160 participants). 
Limited data were available and the findings were very uncertain.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical 
antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM 
because of the limited amount of low-quality evidence available. However, 
amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the use of 
topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in 
addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative 
effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine 
with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than 
aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect 
profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make 
any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

BACKGROUND: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common disease that causes 
discomfort and impairs the quality of life of affected persons. Treatments such 
as physical exercise that aim to increase the movement of the ankle joint and 
strengthen the muscle pump in the calf of the leg may be useful to reduce the 
symptoms of CVI.
OBJECTIVES: To assess and summarise the existing clinical evidence on the 
efficacy and safety of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of 
individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the 
Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (May 2016). In addition, the CIS searched 
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) and 
trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise with 
no exercise programmes.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the 
search results and selected eligible studies. We resolved disagreements by 
discussion. We summarised and double-checked details from included studies. We 
attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, but obtained no further 
information.
MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials involving 54 participants with CVI. Many of 
our review outcomes were not reported or reported by only one of the two 
studies. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both 
studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data. 
One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas 
the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. In one study, 
increases in change in ejection fraction compared with baseline (mean difference 
(MD) 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16 to 6.60; 30 participants; P < 
0.00001), half venous refilling time (MD 4.20 seconds, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.12; 23 
participants; P < 0.00001) and total venous refilling time (MD 9.40 seconds, 95% 
CI 7.77 to 11.03; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) were observed in the exercise 
group compared with the control group. One study reported no difference between 
the exercise and control groups with regard to quality of life or ankle range of 
motion. Although muscle strength assessed by dynamometry at slow speed did not 
differ between the two groups in this study, variable peak torque at fast speed 
was lower in the control group than in the exercise group (2.8 ± 0.9 compared 
with -0.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.03). The incidence of venous leg ulcers, incidence of 
surgical intervention to treat symptoms related to CVI and exercise capacity 
were not assessed or reported in either of the included trials. We rated both 
included studies as at high risk of bias; hence, these data should be 
interpreted carefully. Due to the small number of studies and small sample size, 
we were not able to verify indirectness and publication bias. Therefore, we 
judged the overall quality of evidence as very low according to the GRADE 
approach.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence available to 
assess the efficacy of physical exercise in people with CVI. Future research 
into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols 
(intensity, frequency and time), sample size, blinding and homogeneity according 
to the severity of disease.

PURPOSE: Treatment for ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) has historically 
been surgery, but nonsurgical interventions are increasingly used. Treatment 
with interferon is efficacious, but evidence is needed regarding recurrence and 
complication rates in comparison with surgery. The objective of this study is to 
compare the recurrence and complication rates of surgical treatment and 
interferon treatment for OSSN.
DESIGN: A matched, case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-eight patients with OSSN, 49 of whom were treated with 
interferon (IFN) α2b therapy and 49 of whom were treated with surgical 
intervention.
METHODS: Patients with OSSN were treated with surgery versus IFNα2b therapy, 
either in topical or injection form. Median follow-up after lesion resolution 
was 21 months (range, 0-173 months) for the IFNα2b group and 24 months (range, 
0.9-108 months) for the surgery group.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure for the study was the rate of 
recurrence of OSSN in each of the treatment groups. Recurrence rates were 
evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: Mean patient age and sex were similar between the groups. There was a 
trend toward higher clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor grade in 
the IFNα2b group. Despite this, the number of recurrences was equal at 3 per 
group. The 1-year recurrence rate was 5% in the surgery group versus 3% in the 
IFNα2b group (P = 0.80). There was no statistically significant difference in 
the recurrence rate between the surgically and medically treated groups. 
Nonlimbal location was a risk factor for recurrence (hazard ratio, 8.96) in the 
entire study population. In patients who were treated successfully, the side 
effects of the 2 treatments were similar, with mild discomfort seen in the 
majority of patients in both groups. There was no limbal stem cell deficiency, 
symblepharon, or diplopia noted in either group. Two patients were excluded from 
the IFNα2b group because of intolerance to the medication.
CONCLUSIONS: No difference in the recurrence rate of OSSN was found between 
surgical versus IFNα2b therapy.

BACKGROUND: Online information on COVID-19 vaccination may influence people's 
perception and willingness to be vaccinated. Official websites of vaccination 
programs have not been systematically assessed before.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess and compare the readability and content 
quality of web-based information on COVID-19 vaccination posted on 
official/governmental websites. Furthermore, the relationship between evaluated 
website parameters and country vaccination rates were calculated.
METHODS: By referring to an open data set hosted at Our World in Data, the 58 
countries/regions with the highest total vaccination count as of July 8, 2021, 
were identified. Together with the websites from the World Health Organization 
and European Union, a total of 60 vaccination campaign websites were targeted. 
The "frequently asked questions" or "questions and answers" section of the 
websites were evaluated in terms of readability (Flesch Reading Ease score and 
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), quality (Health On the Net Foundation code 
[HONcode] certification and Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool), and content 
stating vaccination duration of protection and potential side effects.
RESULTS: In terms of readability, the Flesch Reading Ease score of the 
vaccination frequently asked questions websites ranged between 11.2 and 69.5, 
with a mean of 40.9 (SD 13.2). Meanwhile, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level ranged 
between 6.5 and 17.6, with a mean of 12.1 (SD 2.8). In terms of quality, only 2 
websites were HONcode certified, and the Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool score 
of the websites ranged between 7 and 20, with a mean of 15.3 (SD 3.1). Half of 
the websites (25/50) did not present a publication date or date of the last 
update. Regarding the duration of protection offered by the vaccines, 46% 
(23/50) of the websites stated that they do not know, and another 40% (20/50) 
did not address it. Five side effects of the vaccinations were most frequently 
mentioned, namely, fever/chill (41/50, 82%), various injection site discomfort 
events (eg, swelling, redness, or pain; 39/50, 78%), headache (36/50, 72%), 
fatigue (33/50, 66%), and muscle/joint pain (31/50, 62%).
CONCLUSIONS: In general, the content quality of most of the evaluated websites 
was good, but HONcode certification should be considered, content should be 
written in a more readable manner, and a publication date or date of the last 
update should be presented.

BACKGROUND: Night eating syndrome (NES) is a unique eating disorder 
characterised by evening hyperphagia and nocturnal ingestions which cause 
significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. Despite the growing 
literature, NES remains poorly understood and under diagnosed. As such, this 
study aims to compare the prevalence of physical health conditions in 
participants with NES when compared to participants without an eating disorder 
(ED) and participants with other eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa 
(AN), binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN)) in a general 
population Australian sample of adults.
METHODS: The data for this study were obtained from the 2017 Health Omnibus 
Survey (HOS) a multi-stage, cross-sectional survey, conducted by Harrison 
Research in South Australia. This current study focused on 2547 participants 
over 18 years of age and specific questions from this population survey 
including those related to participant demographics and health.
RESULTS: This study identified that participants who screened positive for night 
eating syndrome (spNES) when compared to participants with other eating 
disorders (ED) or no ED diagnosis, were significantly more likely to have an 
increased age, be female, have lower levels of education and have lower 
household income. Additionally, the spNES group was significantly associated 
with sleep apnoea (p = 0.031), insomnia or other sleep problems (p < 0.0001), 
increased BMI (p < 0.0001), increased levels of pain/discomfort and lower 
physical health-related quality of life. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and 
diabetes were not significantly associated with the spNES group or the "other 
ED" group which included participants with AN, BED, BN.
CONCLUSIONS: Several physical health problems were found to be significantly 
associated with the spNES group including sleep problems, increased BMI, 
increased levels of pain and lower self-reported physical health-related quality 
of life. Consequently, future research exploring the complex interaction between 
NES and these medical conditions may provide further insight into the diagnosis, 
screening tools and management of NES. Additionally, this study highlights the 
need for future studies which use larger population-based samples.

BACKGROUND: There is still lack of consensus on the benefit-harm balance of 
breast cancer screening. In this scenario, women's values and preferences are 
crucial for developing health-related recommendations. In the context of the 
European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer, we conducted a systematic 
review to inform the European Breast Guidelines.
METHODS: We searched Medline and included primary studies assessing women's 
values and preferences regarding breast cancer screening and diagnosis decision 
making. We used a thematic approach to synthesise relevant data. The quality of 
evidence was determined with GRADE, including GRADE CERQual for qualitative 
research.
RESULTS: We included 22 individual studies. Women were willing to accept the 
psychological and physical burden of breast cancer screening and a significant 
risk of overdiagnosis and false-positive mammography findings, in return for the 
benefit of earlier diagnosis. The anxiety engendered by the delay in getting 
results of diagnostic tests was highlighted as a significant burden, emphasising 
the need for rapid and efficient screening services, and clear and efficient 
communication. The confidence in the findings was low to moderate for screening 
and moderate for diagnosis, predominantly because of methodological limitations, 
lack of adequate understanding of the outcomes by participants, and 
indirectness.
CONCLUSIONS: Women value more the possibility of an earlier diagnosis over the 
risks of a false-positive result or overdiagnosis. Concerns remain that women 
may not understand the concept of overdiagnosis. Women highly value time 
efficient screening processes and rapid result delivery and will accept some 
discomfort for the peace of mind screening may provide.

Postural instability and loss of vestibular and somatosensory acuity can be part 
of the signs encountered in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Visual dependency is 
described in PD. These modifications of sensory input hierarchy are predictors 
of motion sickness (MS). The aim of this study was to assess MS susceptibility 
and effects of real induced MS in posture. 63 PD patients, whose medication 
levels (levodopa) reflected the pathology were evaluated, and 27 healthy 
controls, filled a MS questionnaire; 9 PD patients and 43 healthy controls were 
assessed by posturography using virtual reality. Drug amount predicted visual MS 
(p=0.01), but not real induced MS susceptibility. PD patients did not experience 
postural instability in virtual reality, contrary to healthy controls. Since PD 
patients do not seem to feel vestibular stimulated MS, they may not rely on 
vestibular and somatosensory inputs during the stimulation. However, they feel 
visually induced MS more with increased levodopa drug effect. Levodopa amount 
can increase visual dependency. The strongest MS predictors must be studied in 
PD to better understand the effect of visual stimulation and its absence in 
vestibular stimulation.

Conflict of interest statement: We confirm that we have read the Journal’s 
position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report 
is consistent with those guidelines. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by destruction of dopamine neurons, 
involved in motor control. The cardinal symptoms are akinesia, rigidity, rest 
tremor and postural instability. Muscle rigidity affects the patient’s motor 
performance, and plays an important part in their akinesia and postural 
instability. Although postural instability is often considered as having its 
origin in motor neurology, non-motor signs as sensory disturbances are also 
important in PD. Postural instability in PD is not only based on muscle and 
joint rigidity,, loss of muscle strength, or failure to generate the right 
amount of postural force, but also from a decrease in sensitivity and 
integration of the three senses necessary to maintain balance. Difficulties in 
somatosensory integration, such as limb position information and limb motion 
information, are described in PD patients. Therefore, this impaired kinesthesia 
disturbs postural control., Although vestibular function is impaired in PD 
patients, it is unclear how it affect posture. There were no differences in 
postural response evoked by galvanic stimulation, affecting Vestibulo Spinal 
Reflex (VSR), in PD patients compared to controls. However, studies that 
assessed vestibular-evoked myogenic potential found abnormal responses in PD 
patients (see Smith, 2018, for a review). Moreover, head tilt perception is 
inaccurate, highlighting a vestibular integration deficit. PD patients also 
experience visuospatial deficits, deteriorating self-motion perception, which 
are required for optimal postural control. In addition to these sensorial 
integration dysfunctions, PD patients have difficulties integrating and 
organizing multisensory information., This sensory organization impairment 
causes them to be overly reliant on visual input, despite visual deficit, as 
well for visual subjective vertical, for self-motion perception, and for 
postural control., Inadequate integration of different movement stimuli can 
provoke motion sickness (MS). Symptoms of MS such as discomfort, nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, loss of concentration, headache and increased 
fatigue are well known. MS pathophysiology is two pronged: Vestibular 
stimulation, experienced in passive traveling by motored means of transport as 
car, train, boat, etc. and worsened by an absence of visual cues, which we call 
Real Induced Motion Sickness (RIMS). Visual stimulation without vestibular 
stimulation or physical motion. Here the individual is motionless but the visual 
scenario is vivid as in daily life looking at traffic, or when exposed to 
virtual reality (VR) with head mounted display (Figure 1), provoking Visual 
Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS). Among the different theories explaining MS, the 
first is a theory of sensory conflict, which argues a neural or a sensory 
mismatch, especially between visual and vestibular input., Visual dependency can 
more easily generate MS, when relying on incongruent visual input. Another 
theory postulates that some situations provoke a prolonged postural instability, 
thereby inducing MS. For example, in vehicles where people frequently experience 
changes in gravito-inertial forces, in amplitude and direction, which can 
provoke postural instability. Both theories can provide arguments favorable to a 
hypothesis that PD patients could be susceptible to MS. Indeed PD patients are 
known to be visually dependent and to have an unstable posture., Some individual 
predictors of MS susceptibility can stimulate debate. Mittelstaedt’s review 
highlighted the role of vestibular sensitivity in RIMS susceptibility when PD 
patients had unclear vestibular problems, other predictors such as anxiety, or 
difficulties regulating posture with vestibular input which supports the above 
hypothesis. However, to our knowledge, no study had been published on this 
subject. We note that normal aging decreases sensory input acuity also, and that 
aging could worsen problems already existing in PD, as PD can worsen problems 
previously existing in the elderly. Dopaminergic drugs, that are used to reduce 
the cardinal bradykinetic symptoms of PD, may have side effects that worsen 
other motor and even non-motor symptoms such as sensorimotor neuropathy and 
anxiety. Medication deteriorates postural control by reducing postural reflex 
response,, can degrade proprioceptive input, and the score of condition 5 in the 
Sensory Organization Test where vestibular input is the most important. 
Therefore, we can hypothesize that the more PD patients take dopaminergic drugs, 
the more they should be susceptible to MS. This study’s aim will be on the one 
hand to evaluate subjective RIMS and visual discomfort in patients with PD and 
evaluate if age and the amount of medication can predict susceptibility to 
visual dependency and RIMS susceptibility. On the other hand, the second aim 
will be to assess if PD patients have worse postural control than HC in a 
simulated situation that can provoke RIMS. A VR-based experiment called BioVRSea 
is used in this case, having previously been shown useful in the assessment of 
neurophysiological signals of postural control/motion sickness in healthy, and 
concussion subjects. [Figure: see text] [Figure: see text]

BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumors to the pancreas are uncommon, accounting for 
approximately 2% of pancreatic malignancies. The most common primary tumors to 
give rise to pancreatic metastases are carcinomas.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year old female patient was investigated for a cause of 
abdominal discomfort. She had a 2-year history of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea 
which was ascribed to a fibroid uterus. On imaging, she was found to have a 
large solid and cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas. Imaging also confirmed 
a fibroid uterus. A distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy showed a 9 cm 
circumscribed mass within, and grossly confined to, the parenchyma of the 
pancreatic tail. Microscopically, the pancreatic lesion was lobulated, and 
well-circumscribed, but focally infiltrative. It comprised sheets of uniform 
spindled to epithelioid cells with round to oval nuclei, coarse to vesicular 
chromatin, visible nucleoli, nuclear grooves and clear to eosinophilic 
cytoplasm. Prominent arterioles were identified. The stroma was collagenized in 
areas. Occasional hemosiderin-laden macrophages were seen, and focal cystic 
change was present. There was no evidence of nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic 
activity or necrosis, and there was no evidence of endometriosis despite 
multiple sections being taken. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells 
were positive for CD10, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), 
Wilms tumor-1 (WT-1) and smooth muscle actin (SMA). RNA sequencing detected a 
PHF1 rearrangement. The morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular 
features were of a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS). Subsequent 
total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 3 months later, showed 
uterine fibroids and a 5 cm low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma confined to 
the uterus, with lymphatic invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of 
metastatic endometrial stromal sarcoma of uterus presenting as a primary 
pancreatic neoplasm. An unexpected extra-uterine location and unusual 
presentation of ESS may make the diagnosis challenging, despite classic 
histological features. Morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular findings 
must be combined to render the correct diagnosis.

PURPOSE: Cervical myelopathy (CM) is generally considered an indication for 
surgery in Western medicine. Case reports have indicated that Korean medicine 
(KM) treatments are effective in improving CM-associated symptoms. We 
investigated the effectiveness of non-surgical KM treatment of CM patients 
through a retrospective chart review and follow-up survey.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and 
surveyed follow-up data of CM patients with neurological symptoms admitted to KM 
hospitals between January 2011 and January 2018. The admission and discharge 
assessments included the numeric rating scale (NRS) for neck and arm pain, neck 
disability index (NDI), and 5-level EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D-5L). A follow-up 
survey was conducted about whether surgery was subsequently performed or 
recommended, symptom recurrence, discomfort in daily living, current treatment, 
as well as NRS, NDI, EQ-5D-5L, and patient global impression of change (PGIC) 
scores.
RESULTS: The NRS for neck pain decreased from 4.88 ± 2.03 (95% CI: 4.23‒5.52) at 
admission to 3.23 ± 1.64 (95% CI: 2.70‒3.75) at discharge and 2.24 ± 1.84 (95% 
CI: 1.43‒3.05) at follow-up. The NRS for radiating arm pain decreased from 5.42 
± 1.55 (95% CI: 4.93‒5.92) to 3.77 ± 1.54 (95% CI: 3.28‒4.27) at discharge and 
2.43 ± 1.60 (95% CI: 1.72‒3.13) at follow-up. The NDI decreased significantly 
from 36.24 ± 18.79 (95% CI: 30.24‒42.24) at admission to 30.89 ± 15.54 (95% CI: 
25.93‒35.86) at discharge and 13.35 ± 11.95 (95% CI: 8.08‒18.63) at follow-up. 
The EQ-5D score improved significantly from 0.70 ± 0.21 (95% CI: 0.63‒0.77) to 
0.78 ± 0.17 (95% CI: 0.73‒0.84) at discharge and 0.84 ± 0.08 (95% CI: 0.80‒0.88) 
at follow-up. At the follow-up, four patients experienced persistent pain and 
were undergoing treatment (19.1%), while 20 patients (95.8%) reported symptom 
improvement.
CONCLUSION: From a long-term perspective, integrative KM treatment may help to 
reduce pain and improve function, and improve quality of life of CM patients.

BACKGROUND: Minimal pain and opioid use after operative treatment for pediatric 
supracondylar humeral fractures have been previously described; however, 
opioid-prescribing practices in the United States remain variable. We 
hypothesized that children without an opioid prescription would report similar 
postoperative pain compared with children prescribed opioids following closed 
reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) of supracondylar humeral fractures.
METHODS: Children who were 3 to 12 years of age and were undergoing CRPP for a 
closed supracondylar humeral fracture were prospectively enrolled in a 
multicenter, comparative study. Following a standardized dosing protocol, 
oxycodone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen were prescribed at 2 hospitals (opioid 
cohort), and 2 other hospitals prescribed ibuprofen and acetaminophen alone 
(non-opioid cohort). The children's medication use and the daily pain that they 
experienced (scored on the Wong-Baker FACES Scale) were recorded at 
postoperative days 1 to 7, 10, 14, and 21, using validated text-message 
protocols. Based on an a priori power analysis, at least 64 evaluable subjects 
were recruited per cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were evaluated (81 [52%] in the opioid cohort 
and 76 [48%] in the non-opioid cohort). The median age at the time of the 
surgical procedure was 6.2 years, and 50% of the subjects were male. The mean 
postoperative pain scores were low overall (<4 of 10), and there were no 
significant differences in pain ratings between cohorts at any time point. No 
patient demographic or injury characteristics were correlated with increased 
pain or medication use. Notably, of the 81 patients in the opioid cohort, 28 
(35%) took no oxycodone and 40 (49%) took 1 to 3 total doses across the 
postoperative period. Patients rarely took opioids after postoperative day 2. A 
single patient in the non-opioid cohort (1 [1%] of 76) received a rescue 
prescription of opioids after presenting to the emergency department with 
postoperative cast discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-opioid analgesia following CRPP for pediatric supracondylar 
humeral fractures was equally effective as opioid analgesia. When oxycodone was 
prescribed, 84% of children took 0 to 3 total doses, and opioid use fell 
precipitously after postoperative day 2. To improve opioid stewardship, 
providers and institutions can consider discontinuing the routine prescription 
of opioids following this procedure.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a neurological condition that affects the cognitive and 
functional ability of the brain and is the leading cause of disability among 
those aged 65 years and above. More effective ways to manage dementia symptoms 
are needed because current treatment options (antidepressants and 
antipsychotics) can be ineffective and are associated with substantial side 
effects, including increased rate of mortality. Cannabinoid-based medicine (CBM) 
has shown an ability to inhibit some symptoms associated with dementia, and the 
adverse effects are often minimal; yet, little research has explored the use of 
CBM among this population.
AIM: To monitor the safety of a purified dose of CBM oil (3:2 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol) on behaviour symptoms, quality of life 
and discomfort caused by pain.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will carry out an 18-week, randomised, double-blind crossover 
trial that consists of a 2-week eligibility period, two 6-week treatment cycles, 
and two 2-week washout periods (between both cycles and after the second 
treatment cycle). We aim to recruit 50 participants with dementia who are living 
in residential aged-care facilities. The participants will be randomised into 
two groups and will receive a dose of either CBM oil or placebo for the first 
treatment cycle and the opposite medication for the second. Data will be 
collected using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, the 
Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease 
questionnaire, and the Abbey Pain Scale on seven occasions. These will be 
completed by the participants, aged-care staff, and nominated next of kin or 
family members. The participants' heart rate and blood pressure will be 
monitored weekly, and their body composition and weight will be monitored 
fortnightly by a research nurse, to assess individual dose response and frailty. 
In addition, pre- and post-surveys will be administered to aged-care staff and 
family members to understand their perceptions of CBM and to inform proposed 
focus groups consisting of the aged-care staff and next of kin.
DISCUSSION: The study design has been informed by medical professionals and key 
stakeholders, including those working in the residential aged-care industry to 
ensure patient safety, collection of non-invasive measures, and methodological 
rigor and study feasibility.

BACKGROUND: Most HIV cure-related studies involve interrupting antiretroviral 
treatment to assess the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions - also known as 
analytical treatment interruptions (ATIs). ATIs imply the risk of passing HIV to 
sexual partners due to the loss of undetectable HIV status. There has been a 
notable lack of attention paid to perceptions of ATIs among racial, ethnic, sex 
and gender minorities, and HIV serodifferent couples. These populations are 
among those most impacted by HIV in the United States. Future HIV cure research 
paradigms should equitably include considerations from these groups.
METHODS: From August - October 2020, we conducted in-depth interviews with 10 
racial, ethnic, sex, and gender minority HIV serodifferent couples in 
geographically diverse regions of the United States to understand their 
perspectives about ATIs and partner protection measures to prevent secondary HIV 
transmissions because of participation in ATI studies. We used framework 
analysis to analyze the qualitative data.
RESULTS: Of the 10 couples recruited, four identified as a gay couple, two as a 
gay and bisexual couple, two as a heterosexual couple, one as a gay and queer 
couple, and one as a queer couple. We found that HIV serodifferent couples in 
our study viewed ATIs as contradicting HIV treatment adherence messages. Couples 
expressed discomfort around ATIs in HIV cure research. They were concerned with 
the return of HIV detectability and worried ATIs might result in secondary HIV 
transmission. Participants were strongly in favor of using a range of partner 
protection measures during ATIs that included PrEP, HIV risk reduction 
counseling, and alternatives for penetrative sex practices. Couples also 
recommended that sex partners be consulted or involved as part of ATI trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight new potential opportunities and strategies 
to mitigate risk of HIV transmission during ATIs among key groups historically 
under-represented in HIV cure research. Findings also underscore the relational 
aspects of ATI trials. We provide preliminary considerations for planning ATI 
trials with diverse HIV serodifferent partners. Future studies should continue 
to explore these issues among other types of partnerships, cultures, and 
socio-cultural settings.

BACKGROUND: Acquired hearing loss is common and its incidence increases markedly 
with age. In most people, 'age-related' hearing loss is sensorineural (due to 
the loss of cochlear hair cells) and bilateral, affecting both ears to the same 
degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily 
managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one 
aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is 
uncertainty about the relative benefits to people with hearing loss of these 
different strategies.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of bilateral versus unilateral hearing aids in 
adults with a bilateral hearing impairment.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials 
Register; Cochrane Register of Studies Online; PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web 
of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and 
unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 June 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the fitting of 
two versus one ear-level acoustic hearing aids in adults (over 18 years) with a 
bilateral hearing impairment, both ears being eligible for hearing aids.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures 
expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were patient preference for bilateral 
or unilateral aids, hearing-specific health-related quality of life and adverse 
effects (pain or discomfort in the ear, initiation or exacerbation of middle or 
outer ear infection). Secondary outcomes included: usage of hearing aids (as 
measured by, for example, data logging or battery consumption), generic 
health-related quality of life, listening ability and audiometric benefit 
measured as binaural loudness summation. We used GRADE to assess the quality of 
the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.
MAIN RESULTS: We included four cross-over RCTs with a total of 209 participants, 
ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with a preponderance of men. All the studies 
allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks 
before questions on preference were asked. All studies recruited patients with 
bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in the types and 
degree of sensorineural hearing loss that the participants were 
experiencing.Three of the studies were published before the mid-1990s whereas 
the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study 
used hearing aids incorporating technology comparable to that currently readily 
available in high-income settings. Of the four studies, two were conducted in 
the UK in National Health Service (NHS - public sector) patients: one recruited 
patients from primary care with hearing loss detected by a screening programme 
whereas the other recruited patients who had been referred by their primary care 
practitioner to an otolaryngology department for hearing aids. The other two 
studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only military 
personnel or veterans with noise-induced hearing loss whereas about half of the 
participants in the other study were veterans.Only one primary outcome (patient 
preference) was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who 
preferred bilateral hearing aids varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 
94 participants), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), 
respectively. We have not combined the data from these four studies. The 
evidence for this outcome is of very low quality.The other outcomes of interest 
were not reported in the included studies.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identified only four studies comparing the use 
of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included participants of 
widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types and 
degree of sensorineural hearing loss that the participants were experiencing.For 
the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in 
high-income settings, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 
'modern' digital aids. However, the relevance of this is uncertain, as this 
review did not evaluate the differences in outcomes between the different types 
of technology.We were unable to pool data from the four studies and the very low 
quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if people with 
hearing loss have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if 
hearing-specific health-related quality of life, or any of our other outcomes, 
are better with bilateral or unilateral aids.

Comment in
    Musculoskelet Sci Pract. 2019 Dec;44:102065.

BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain syndrome, now generally referred to as 
patellofemoral pain (PFP), is one of the most common orthopaedic disorders, 
characterised by pain in the anterior or retropatellar knee region. 
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been proposed generally as a 
complementary treatment, associated with other interventions such as exercise, 
or as a single treatment to increase muscle force, reduce knee pain, and improve 
function.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of neuromuscular 
electrical stimulation for people with patellofemoral pain.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group 
Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, LILACS, trial 
registers, conference abstracts, and reference lists. We carried out the search 
in May 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled clinical trials that 
evaluated the use of NMES for people with PFP.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the 
process of study selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment in 
duplicate. The primary outcomes were knee pain, knee function, and adverse 
events. The timing of outcome measurements was up to three months (short term), 
three to 12 months (medium term), and 12 months and above from trial entry (long 
term). We calculated risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences or 
standardised mean differences for continuous data. Where appropriate, we pooled 
data using the fixed-effect model.
MAIN RESULTS: We included eight randomised clinical trials, reporting results 
for 345 participants with PFP. The mean ages of trial populations ranged from 25 
to 43 years, and the majority (53% to 100%) of participants were female. There 
was a wide duration of symptoms, with the minimum duration of symptoms for trial 
inclusion ranging from one to six months. In addition to the study inclusion 
criteria, studies varied widely in the characteristics of the NMES and its 
application, and associated co-interventions. We assessed all trials as at high 
risk of bias in at least one domain, particularly blinding and incomplete 
outcome data. The results of a laboratory-based trial reporting knee pain 
immediately after a single 15-minute session of NMES are not reported here as 
these are of questionable clinical relevance. The seven remaining trials 
provided evidence for three comparisons. We assessed the overall quality of the 
evidence, using GRADE, for all primary outcomes for all comparisons as very low, 
thus we are very unsure of the findings.Four studies compared NMES plus exercise 
versus exercise alone. Patellar taping was applied as well as exercise to all 
participants of one study, and patellar taping and ice were also applied in 
another study. Each trial tested a different multiple-session NMES programme. 
Pooled data from three studies (118 participants) provided very low-quality 
evidence that NMES is associated with reduced pain at the end of treatment 
(ranging from 3 to 12 weeks): mean difference -1.63, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) -2.23 to -1.02; visual analogue scale (VAS) 0 to 10; higher scores = worse 
pain. However, this result may not be clinically relevant since the minimal 
clinically important difference for VAS during activities (1.5 to 2.0, out of 10 
points) lies within the 95% CI. We found very low-quality evidence from pooled 
data from two trials of little effect of NMES on knee function, as measured by 
two knee function rating systems. We found inconclusive and very low-quality 
evidence from one trial (29 participants) of little effect of NMES on pain and 
function at one-year follow-up. None of the four trials reported on adverse 
effects of treatment.One study (94 participants) compared NMES, applied four 
hours per day on a daily basis for four weeks, with two types of exercises 
(isometric and isokinetic). The study did not report on knee pain or adverse 
events. The study provided very low-quality evidence of no important difference 
between the two groups in knee function at the end of the four-week treatment. 
Of note is the potentially onerous NMES schedule in this study, which does not 
correspond to that typically used in clinical practice.Two studies compared 
different types of NMES. Simultaneously delivered high-low frequencies NMES was 
compared with sequentially delivered high-low frequencies NMES in one trial (14 
participants) and with fixed frequency NMES in the second trial (64 
participants). The studies provided very low-quality evidence of no important 
differences at the end of the six-week treatment programme between the 
simultaneous frequencies NMES and the two other NMES programmes in overall knee 
pain, knee function, or in quadriceps fatigue (an adverse event).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found insufficient and inconclusive evidence 
from randomised controlled trials to inform on the role of NMES for treating 
people with PFP in current clinical practice. The very low-quality evidence 
available means that we are uncertain whether or not a multiple-session 
programme of NMES combined with exercise over several weeks versus exercise 
alone results in clinically important differences in knee pain and function at 
the end of the treatment period or at one year. There were no data on adverse 
effects such as muscle fatigue and discomfort. High-quality randomised clinical 
trials are needed to inform on the use of NMES for people with PFP. However, 
professional and stakeholder consensus is required on prioritisation of the 
research questions for interventions for treating people with PFP, including on 
the NMES treatment protocol for trials testing NMES.

BACKGROUND: This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management 
options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.Chronic rhinosinusitis is 
common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and 
paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial 
pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or 
without nasal polyps. Nasal saline irrigation is commonly used to improve 
patient symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of saline irrigation in patients with 
chronic rhinosinusitis.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials 
Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); 
MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published 
and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2015.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period 
of at least three months comparing saline delivered to the nose by any means 
(douche, irrigation, drops, spray or nebuliser) with (a) placebo, (b) no 
treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures 
expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related 
quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest 
adverse event - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic 
nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse 
events of local irritation and discomfort. We used GRADE to assess the quality 
of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.
MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared 
large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2%) saline irrigation with usual treatment 
over a six-month period; the other compared 5 ml nebulised saline twice a day 
with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and 
evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Large-volume, 
hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care One trial included 76 adult 
participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without 
polyps.Disease-specific HRQL was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability 
Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months 
of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo 
group (mean difference (MD) 6.3 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 
11.71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13.5 points, 95% CI 9.63 
to 17.37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months 
follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported 
disease severity was evaluated using a "single-item sinus symptom severity 
assessment" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us 
to determine the meaning of the data presented.No adverse effects data were 
collected in the control group but 23% of participants in the saline group 
experienced side effects including epistaxis. General HRQL was measured using 
SF-12 (0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). No difference was found after 
three months of treatment (low quality evidence) but at six months there was a 
small difference favouring the saline group, which may not be of clinical 
significance and has high uncertainty (MD 10.5 points, 95% CI 0.66 to 20.34) 
(very low quality evidence). Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal 
corticosteroids One trial included 40 adult participants with polyps. Our 
primary outcome of disease-specific HRQL was not reported. At the end of 
treatment (three months) the patients who had intranasal corticosteroids had 
less severe symptoms (MD -13.50, 95% CI -14.44 to -12.56); this corresponds to a 
large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be of very low quality.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The two studies were very different in terms of included 
populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to 
draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there is no benefit of 
a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids. There is 
some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic 
solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low for 
three months and very low for six months of treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Valid measures of appearance concern are needed in systemic sclerosis 
(SSc), a rare, disfiguring autoimmune disease. The Derriford Appearance Scale-24 
(DAS-24) assesses appearance-related distress related to visible differences. 
There is uncertainty regarding its factor structure, possibly due to its scoring 
method.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: Participants with SSc were recruited from 27 centres in Canada, the USA 
and the UK. Participants who self-identified as having visible differences were 
recruited from community and clinical settings in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Two samples were analysed (n=950 participants with SSc; n=1265 
participants with visible differences).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The DAS-24 factor structure was 
evaluated using two scoring methods. Convergent validity was evaluated with 
measures of social interaction anxiety, depression, fear of negative evaluation, 
social discomfort and dissatisfaction with appearance.
RESULTS: When items marked by respondents as 'not applicable' were scored as 0, 
per standard DAS-24 scoring, a one-factor model fit poorly; when treated as 
missing data, the one-factor model fit well. Convergent validity analyses 
revealed strong correlations that were similar across scoring methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating 'not applicable' responses as missing improved the 
measurement model, but did not substantively influence practical inferences that 
can be drawn from DAS-24 scores. Indications of item redundancy and poorly 
performing items suggest that the DAS-24 could be improved and potentially 
shortened.

BACKGROUND: Root caries is a well-recognised disease, with increasing prevalence 
as populations age and retain more of their natural teeth into later life. Like 
coronal caries, root caries can be associated with pain, discomfort, tooth loss, 
and contribute significantly to poorer oral health-related quality of life in 
the elderly. Supplementing the visual-tactile examination could prove beneficial 
in improving the accuracy of early detection and diagnosis. The detection of 
root caries lesions at an early stage in the disease continuum can inform 
diagnosis and lead to targeted preventive therapies and lesion arrest.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of index tests for the 
detection and diagnosis of root caries in adults, used alone or in combination 
with other tests.
SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search 
of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2018); Embase Ovid 
(1980 to 31 December 2018); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials 
Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 31 December 2018); and the World Health 
Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 31 December 
2018). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review 
articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared 
one or more index tests (laser fluorescence, radiographs, visual examination, 
electronic caries monitor (ECM), transillumination), either independently or in 
combination, with a reference standard. This included prospective studies that 
evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests and studies that 
directly compared two or more index tests. In vitro and in vivo studies were 
eligible for inclusion but studies that artificially created carious lesions 
were excluded.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data independently 
and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment 
form based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) 
specific to the review context. Estimates of diagnostic test accuracy were 
expressed as sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
each dataset. We planned to use hierarchical models for data synthesis and 
explore potential sources of heterogeneity through meta-regression.
MAIN RESULTS: Four cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies providing 
eight datasets with data from 4997 root surfaces were analysed. Two in vitro 
studies evaluated secondary root caries lesions on extracted teeth and two in 
vivo studies evaluated primary root caries lesions within the oral cavity. Four 
studies evaluated laser fluorescence and reported estimates of sensitivity 
ranging from 0.50 to 0.81 and specificity ranging from 0.40 to 0.80. Two studies 
evaluated radiographs and reported estimates of sensitivity ranging from 0.40 to 
0.63 and specificity ranging from 0.31 to 0.80. One study evaluated visual 
examination and reported sensitivity of 0.75 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.93) and 
specificity of 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68). One study evaluated the accuracy of 
radiograph and visual examination in combination and reported sensitivity of 
0.81 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.96) and specificity of 0.54 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.81). Given 
the small number of studies and important differences in the clinical and 
methodological characteristics of the studies we were unable to pool the 
results. Consequently, we were unable to formally evaluate the comparative 
accuracy of the different tests considered in this review. Using QUADAS-2 we 
judged all four studies to be at overall high risk of bias, but only two to have 
applicability concerns (patient selection domain). Reasons included bias in the 
selection process, use of post hoc (data driven) positivity thresholds, use of 
an imperfect reference standard, and use of extracted teeth. We downgraded the 
certainty of the evidence due to study limitations and serious imprecision of 
the results (downgraded two levels), and judged the certainty of the evidence to 
be very low.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Visual-tactile examination is the mainstay of root caries 
detection and diagnosis; however, due to the paucity of the evidence base and 
the very low certainty of the evidence we were unable to determine the 
additional benefit of adjunctive diagnostic tests for the detection and 
diagnosis of root caries.

BACKGROUND: The full range of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 in 
patients who are discharged from hospital is largely unclear. The aim of our 
study was to comprehensively compare consequences between 6 months and 12 months 
after symptom onset among hospital survivors with COVID-19.
METHODS: We undertook an ambidirectional cohort study of COVID-19 survivors who 
had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and 
May 29, 2020. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up visit, survivors were 
interviewed with questionnaires on symptoms and health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL), and received a physical examination, a 6-min walking test, and 
laboratory tests. They were required to report their health-care use after 
discharge and work status at the 12-month visit. Survivors who had completed 
pulmonary function tests or had lung radiographic abnormality at 6 months were 
given the corresponding tests at 12 months. Non-COVID-19 participants (controls) 
matched for age, sex, and comorbidities were interviewed and completed 
questionnaires to assess prevalent symptoms and HRQoL. The primary outcomes were 
symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, HRQoL, and 
distance walked in 6 min (6MWD). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression 
models were used to evaluate the risk factors of 12-month outcomes.
FINDINGS: 1276 COVID-19 survivors completed both visits. The median age of 
patients was 59·0 years (IQR 49·0-67·0) and 681 (53%) were men. The median 
follow-up time was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0-198·0) for the 6-month visit and 349·0 
days (337·0-361·0) for the 12-month visit after symptom onset. The proportion of 
patients with at least one sequelae symptom decreased from 68% (831/1227) at 6 
months to 49% (620/1272) at 12 months (p<0·0001). The proportion of patients 
with dyspnoea, characterised by mMRC score of 1 or more, slightly increased from 
26% (313/1185) at 6-month visit to 30% (380/1271) at 12-month visit (p=0·014). 
Additionally, more patients had anxiety or depression at 12-month visit (26% 
[331/1271] at 12-month visit vs 23% [274/1187] at 6-month visit; p=0·015). No 
significant difference on 6MWD was observed between 6 months and 12 months. 88% 
(422/479) of patients who were employed before COVID-19 had returned to their 
original work at 12 months. Compared with men, women had an odds ratio of 1·43 
(95% CI 1·04-1·96) for fatigue or muscle weakness, 2·00 (1·48-2·69) for anxiety 
or depression, and 2·97 (1·50-5·88) for diffusion impairment. Matched COVID-19 
survivors at 12 months had more problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and 
anxiety or depression, and had more prevalent symptoms than did controls.
INTERPRETATION: Most COVID-19 survivors had a good physical and functional 
recovery during 1-year follow-up, and had returned to their original work and 
life. The health status in our cohort of COVID-19 survivors at 12 months was 
still lower than that in the control population.

BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation 
and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear 
discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant 
symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are a 
commonly used treatment option for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth 
of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be 
used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane 
ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane 
Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; 
ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished 
trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic 
antibiotics (oral, injection) against placebo/no treatment or other systemic 
antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving patients with 
chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. 
Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms also received 
it.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard Cochrane methodological 
procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each 
outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' 
(whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to 
two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related 
quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort 
or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications 
and ototoxicity measured in several ways.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 18 studies (2135 participants) with unclear or high 
risk of bias. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very 
uncertain if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics 
and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge at between one and two weeks 
(risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 33 
participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report 
results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks. Health-related quality 
of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious 
(intracranial) complications. Ear pain and suspected ototoxicity were not 
reported. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms 
received topical antibiotics) Six studies were included of which five presented 
useable data. There may be little or no difference in the resolution of ear 
discharge at between one to two weeks for oral ciprofloxacin compared to placebo 
or no treatment when ciprofloxacin ear drops were used in both intervention arms 
(RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence). No 
results after two weeks were reported. Health-related quality of life was not 
reported. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications and 
suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both 
study arms received other background treatments) Two studies used topical 
antibiotics plus steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very 
uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between 
metronidazole and placebo at four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 40 
participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not report 
other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if resolution of ear discharge at six 
weeks was improved with co-trimoxazole compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 
to 2.16; 98 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of 
ear discharge was not reported at other time points. From the narrative report 
there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality 
of life, hearing or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). One 
study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in 
both arms and found similar resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin 
and no treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 
136 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report 
indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (both 
very low-certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported. 4. Different 
types of systemic antibiotics This is a summary of four comparisons, where 
different antibiotics were compared to each other. Eight studies compared 
different types of systemic antibiotics against each other: quinolones against 
beta-lactams (four studies), lincosamides against nitroimidazoles (one study) 
and comparisons of different types of beta-lactams (three studies). It was not 
possible to conclude if there was one class or type of systemic antibiotic that 
was better in terms of resolution of ear discharge. The studies did not report 
adverse events well.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was a limited amount of evidence available to 
examine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of 
ear discharge for people with CSOM. When used alone (with or without aural 
toileting), we are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics are more effective 
than placebo or no treatment. When added to an effective intervention such as 
topical antibiotics, there seems to be little or no difference in resolution of 
ear discharge (low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain 
classes of antibiotics and it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic 
antibiotic may be more effective than another. Adverse effects of systemic 
antibiotics were poorly reported in the studies included. As we found very 
sparse evidence for their efficacy, the possibility of adverse events may 
detract from their use for CSOM.

BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as 
chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial 
infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid 
cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic 
membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. 
Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit 
the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. 
Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used 
alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM such as ear cleaning (aural 
toileting).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of topical versus systemic antibiotics for 
people with CSOM.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane 
ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane 
Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; 
ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished 
trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at 
least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had 
chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had 
continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics 
against systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics. We separated studies according 
to whether they compared the same type of antibiotic in both treatment groups, 
or different types of antibiotics. For each comparison we considered whether 
there was background treatment for both treatment groups, for example aural 
toileting (ear cleaning).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard Cochrane methodological 
procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each 
outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' 
(whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to 
two weeks, two weeks up to four weeks, and after four weeks), health-related 
quality of life using a validated instrument, ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort 
or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications 
and ototoxicity measured in several ways.
MAIN RESULTS: Six studies (445 participants), all with high risk of bias, were 
included. All but two studies included patients with confirmed CSOM, where 
perforation of the ear drum was clearly documented. None of the studies reported 
results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or health-related 
quality of life. 1. Topical versus systemic administration of the same type of 
antibiotics (quinolones) Four studies (325 participants) compared topical versus 
systemic (oral) administration of ciprofloxacin. Three studies reported 
resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks and found that the topical 
administration may slightly increase resolution (risk ratio (RR) 1.48, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.76; 285 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%; 
low-certainty evidence). In these studies, aural toileting was either not 
mentioned, or limited to the first visit. Three studies (265 participants) 
reported that they did not suspect ototoxicity in any participants, but it is 
unclear how this was measured (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported 
the outcomes of ear pain or serious complications. No studies reported results 
for hearing, despite it being measured in three studies. 2. Topical versus 
systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus 
aminoglycosides) One study (60 participants) compared topical ciprofloxacin 
versus gentamicin injected intramuscularly. No aural toileting was reported. 
Resolution of ear discharge was not measured at one to two weeks. The study did 
not report any 'side effects' from which we assumed that no ear pain, suspected 
ototoxicity or serious complications occurred (very low-certainty evidence). The 
study stated that "no worsening of the audiometric function related to local or 
parenteral therapy was observed". 3. Topical versus systemic administration of 
different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) 
One study compared topical ofloxacin with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with all 
participants receiving suction ear cleaning at the first visit. It is uncertain 
if there is a difference between the two groups in resolution of ear discharge 
at one to two weeks due to study limitations and the very small sample size (RR 
2.93, 95% CI 1.50 to 5.72; 56 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is 
unclear if there is a difference between topical quinolone compared with oral 
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with regards to ear pain, hearing or suspected 
ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcome of 
serious complications.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was a limited amount of low-quality evidence 
available, from studies completed over 15 years ago, to examine whether topical 
or systemic antibiotics are more effective in achieving resolution of ear 
discharge for people with CSOM. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some 
evidence to suggest that the topical administration of antibiotics may be more 
effective than systemic administration of antibiotics in achieving resolution of 
ear discharge (dry ear). There is limited evidence available regarding different 
types of antibiotics. It is not possible to determine with any certainty whether 
or not topical quinolones are better or worse than systemic aminoglycosides. 
These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there 
is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about 
these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as 
chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial 
infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid 
cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic 
membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. 
Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning 
the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue 
paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using 
manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing 
mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less 
effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be 
used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or 
topical antiseptics.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with 
CSOM.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane 
ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane 
Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; 
ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished 
trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at 
least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had 
chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had 
continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the 
intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural 
toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural 
toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in 
both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard Cochrane methodological 
procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each 
outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' 
(whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to 
two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related 
quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or 
discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious 
complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and 
dizziness/vertigo/balance problems.
MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 
ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with 
CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) 
included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. 
None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health-related quality of 
life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. Daily aural toileting (dry 
mopping) versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily 
dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of 
ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. 
For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results 
per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks 
(risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 
participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. No results were 
reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only 
one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these 
patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or 
post-treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by 
treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to 
determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. Daily aural 
toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin One 
study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with 
administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a 
single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered 
topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether 
there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to 
two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the 
certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for 
resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for 
resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, 
and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single 
aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported 
the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold 
topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference 
between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very 
low-certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo 
or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported 
qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing 
results (very low-certainty).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural 
toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a 
lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain 
uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well 
reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, 
followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a 
single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical 
antibiotic ear drops.

OBJECTIVE: Fluorine MR would benefit greatly from enhancements in 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study examines the sensitivity gain of 19F MR 
that can be practically achieved when moving from 9.4 to 21.1 T.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) at both 
field strengths (B0), as a pure compound, in the form of nanoparticles (NP) as 
employed to study inflammation in vivo, as well as in inflamed tissue. Brains, 
lymph nodes (LNs) and spleens were obtained from mice with experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that had been administered PFCE NPs. All 
samples were measured at both B0 with 2D-RARE and 2D-FLASH using 19F volume 
radiofrequency resonators together. T1 and T2 of PFCE were measured at both B0 
strengths.
RESULTS: Compared to 9.4 T, an SNR gain of > 3 was observed for pure PFCE 
and > 2 for PFCE NPs at 21.1 T using 2D-FLASH. A dependency of 19F T1 and T2 
relaxation on B0 was demonstrated. High spatially resolved 19F MRI of EAE brains 
and LNs at 21.1 T revealed signals not seen at 9.4 T.
DISCUSSION: Enhanced SNR and T1 shortening indicate the potential benefit of in 
vivo 19F MR at higher B0 to study inflammatory processes with greater detail.

Previous studies have shown less access to deep brain stimulation (DBS) for 
Parkinson's disease (PD) in women compared to men raising concerns about a 
potential gender gap resulting from nonclinical factors or gender differences in 
clinical efficacy for postoperative quality of life (QoL), motor, and nonmotor 
symptoms (NMS) outcomes. This was a cross-sectional and a longitudinal, 
prospective, observational, controlled, quasi-experimental, international 
multicenter study. A total sample size of 505 consisted of 316 consecutively 
referred patients for DBS indication evaluation at the University Hospital 
Cologne (01/2015-09/2020) and 189 consecutively treated patients at DBS centers 
in the University Hospitals Cologne and Marburg, Salford's Royal Hospital 
Manchester, and King's College Hospital London. In the cross-sectional cohort, 
we examined gender proportions at referral, indication evaluations, and DBS 
surgery. In the longitudinal cohort, clinical assessments at preoperative 
baseline and 6-month follow-up after surgery included the PD Questionnaire-8, 
NMSScale, Scales for Outcomes in PD-motor scale, and levodopa-equivalent daily 
dose. Propensity score matching resulted in a pseudo-randomized sub-cohort 
balancing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between women with 
PD and male controls. 316 patients were referred for DBS. 219 indication 
evaluations were positive (women n = 102, respectively n = 82). Women with PD 
were disproportionally underrepresented in referrals compared to the general PD 
population (relative risk [RR], 0.72; 95%CI, 0.56-0.91; P = 0.002), but more 
likely to be approved for DBS than men (RR, 1.17; 95%CI, 1.03-1.34; P = 0.029). 
Nonetheless, their total relative risk of undergoing DBS treatment was 0.74 
(95%CI, 0.48-1.12) compared to men with PD. At baseline, women had longer 
disease duration and worse dyskinesia. Exploring QoL domains, women reported 
worse mobility and bodily discomfort. At follow-up, all main outcomes improved 
equally in both genders. Our study provides evidence of a gender gap in DBS for 
PD. Women and men with PD have distinct preoperative nonmotor and motor 
profiles. We advocate that more focus should be directed toward the 
implementation of gender equity as both genders benefit from DBS with equal 
clinical efficacy. This study provides Class II evidence of beneficial effects 
of DBS in women with PD compared to male controls.

BACKGROUND: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, growing evidence shows that a 
considerable proportion of people who have recovered from COVID-19 have 
long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. A few longitudinal studies 
have reported on the persistent health effects of COVID-19, but the follow-up 
was limited to 1 year after acute infection. The aim of our study was to 
characterise the longitudinal evolution of health outcomes in hospital survivors 
with different initial disease severity throughout 2 years after acute COVID-19 
infection and to determine their recovery status.
METHODS: We did an ambidirectional, longitudinal cohort study of individuals who 
had survived hospitalisation with COVID-19 and who had been discharged from Jin 
Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. We measured 
health outcomes 6 months (June 16-Sept 3, 2020), 12 months (Dec 16, 2020-Feb 7, 
2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021-Jan 10, 2022) after symptom onset with a 6-min 
walking distance (6MWD) test, laboratory tests, and a series of questionnaires 
on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to 
work, and health-care use after discharge. A subset of COVID-19 survivors 
received pulmonary function tests and chest imaging at each visit. Age-matched, 
sex-matched, and comorbidities-matched participants without COVID-19 infection 
(controls) were introduced to determine the recovery status of COVID-19 
survivors at 2 years. The primary outcomes included symptoms, modified British 
Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL, 6MWD, and return to work, 
and were assessed in all COVID-19 survivors who attended all three follow-up 
visits. Symptoms, mMRC dyspnoea scale, and HRQoL were also assessed in controls.
FINDINGS: 2469 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital 
between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. 1192 COVID-19 survivors completed assessments at 
the three follow-up visits and were included in the final analysis, 1119 (94%) 
of whom attended the face-to-face interview 2 years after infection. The median 
age at discharge was 57·0 years (48·0-65·0) and 551 (46%) were women. The median 
follow-up time after symptom onset was 185·0 days (IQR 175·0-197·0) for the 
visit at 6 months, 349·0 days (337·0-360·0) for the visit at 12 months, and 
685·0 days (675·0-698·0) for the visit at 2 years. The proportion of COVID-19 
survivors with at least one sequelae symptom decreased significantly from 777 
(68%) of 1149 at 6 months to 650 (55%) of 1190 at 2 years (p<0·0001), with 
fatigue or muscle weakness always being the most frequent. The proportion of 
COVID-19 survivors with an mMRC score of at least 1 was 168 (14%) of 1191 at 2 
years, significantly lower than the 288 (26%) of 1104 at 6 months (p<0·0001). 
HRQoL continued to improve in almost all domains, especially in terms of anxiety 
or depression: the proportion of individuals with symptoms of anxiety or 
depression decreased from 256 (23%) of 1105 at 6 months to 143 (12%) 1191 at 2 
years (p<0·0001). The proportion of individuals with a 6MWD less than the lower 
limit of the normal range declined continuously in COVID-19 survivors overall 
and in the three subgroups of varying initial disease severity. 438 (89%) of 494 
COVID-19 survivors had returned to their original work at 2 years. Survivors 
with long COVID symptoms at 2 years had lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, 
more mental health abnormality, and increased health-care use after discharge 
than survivors without long COVID symptoms. COVID-19 survivors still had more 
prevalent symptoms and more problems in pain or discomfort, as well as anxiety 
or depression, at 2 years than did controls. Additionally, a significantly 
higher proportion of survivors who had received higher-level respiratory support 
during hospitalisation had lung diffusion impairment (43 [65%] of 66 vs 24 [36%] 
of 66, p=0·0009), reduced residual volume (41 [62%] vs 13 [20%], p<0·0001), and 
total lung capacity (26 [39%] vs four [6%], p<0·0001) than did controls.
INTERPRETATION: Regardless of initial disease severity, COVID-19 survivors had 
longitudinal improvements in physical and mental health, with most returning to 
their original work within 2 years; however, the burden of symptomatic sequelae 
remained fairly high. COVID-19 survivors had a remarkably lower health status 
than the general population at 2 years. The study findings indicate that there 
is an urgent need to explore the pathogenesis of long COVID and develop 
effective interventions to reduce the risk of long COVID.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) 
should be performed in patients with any clinical probability of coronary artery 
disease (CAD), and whether the diagnostic performance differs between subgroups 
of patients.
DESIGN: Prospectively designed meta-analysis of individual patient data from 
prospective diagnostic accuracy studies.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Web of Science for published studies. 
Unpublished studies were identified via direct contact with participating 
investigators.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Prospective diagnostic accuracy 
studies that compared coronary CTA with coronary angiography as the reference 
standard, using at least a 50% diameter reduction as a cutoff value for 
obstructive CAD. All patients needed to have a clinical indication for coronary 
angiography due to suspected CAD, and both tests had to be performed in all 
patients. Results had to be provided using 2×2 or 3×2 cross tabulations for the 
comparison of CTA with coronary angiography. Primary outcomes were the positive 
and negative predictive values of CTA as a function of clinical pretest 
probability of obstructive CAD, analysed by a generalised linear mixed model; 
calculations were performed including and excluding non-diagnostic CTA results. 
The no-treat/treat threshold model was used to determine the range of 
appropriate pretest probabilities for CTA. The threshold model was based on 
obtained post-test probabilities of less than 15% in case of negative CTA and 
above 50% in case of positive CTA. Sex, angina pectoris type, age, and number of 
computed tomography detector rows were used as clinical variables to analyse the 
diagnostic performance in relevant subgroups.
RESULTS: Individual patient data from 5332 patients from 65 prospective 
diagnostic accuracy studies were retrieved. For a pretest probability range of 
7-67%, the treat threshold of more than 50% and the no-treat threshold of less 
than 15% post-test probability were obtained using CTA. At a pretest probability 
of 7%, the positive predictive value of CTA was 50.9% (95% confidence interval 
43.3% to 57.7%) and the negative predictive value of CTA was 97.8% (96.4% to 
98.7%); corresponding values at a pretest probability of 67% were 82.7% (78.3% 
to 86.2%) and 85.0% (80.2% to 88.9%), respectively. The overall sensitivity of 
CTA was 95.2% (92.6% to 96.9%) and the specificity was 79.2% (74.9% to 82.9%). 
CTA using more than 64 detector rows was associated with a higher empirical 
sensitivity than CTA using up to 64 rows (93.4% v 86.5%, P=0.002) and 
specificity (84.4% v 72.6%, P<0.001). The area under the 
receiver-operating-characteristic curve for CTA was 0.897 (0.889 to 0.906), and 
the diagnostic performance of CTA was slightly lower in women than in with men 
(area under the curve 0.874 (0.858 to 0.890) v 0.907 (0.897 to 0.916), P<0.001). 
The diagnostic performance of CTA was slightly lower in patients older than 75 
(0.864 (0.834 to 0.894), P=0.018 v all other age groups) and was not 
significantly influenced by angina pectoris type (typical angina 0.895 (0.873 to 
0.917), atypical angina 0.898 (0.884 to 0.913), non-anginal chest pain 0.884 
(0.870 to 0.899), other chest discomfort 0.915 (0.897 to 0.934)).
CONCLUSIONS: In a no-treat/treat threshold model, the diagnosis of obstructive 
CAD using coronary CTA in patients with stable chest pain was most accurate when 
the clinical pretest probability was between 7% and 67%. Performance of CTA was 
not influenced by the angina pectoris type and was slightly higher in men and 
lower in older patients.
